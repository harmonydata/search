# Cursor Updates

## 2024-12-19

- Added URL cleaning function to detect and remove extra closing brackets that cause 404 errors in OpenGraph data fetching
- Implemented fallback mechanism in LinkPreviewCard to retry with cleaned URL if first attempt fails
- Added logging for debugging when URLs are cleaned
- Fixed child_datasets data not being passed through to StudyDetail component in search page
- Fixed styling inconsistency in child datasets section header to match other collapsible sections
- Added cleanup API function to services/api.ts for AI-powered dataset summarization using JSON schema data
- Updated system prompts to focus on academic research dataset summarization with metadata and variables
- Integrated cleanup API into StudyDetail component AI Summary section that sends dataset_schema as JSON
- AI Summary uses dataset schema from original SearchResult for comprehensive dataset analysis
- Enhanced AI Summary display to properly format array response with question_text objects as paragraphs
- Added support for basic markdown formatting (bold text) in AI Summary display
- Optimized AI Summary API calls by filtering out large variableMeasured arrays and replacing with variableCount
- Updated system prompts to handle variableCount field instead of full variable lists
- Added knowledge-based AI summarization option that uses AI's existing knowledge of studies
- Implemented automatic fallback from knowledge-based to schema-based summarization when AI doesn't know the study
- Removed toggle UI and made the fallback process seamless for users
- Added conditional display to only show AI Summary section for studies (resourceType === "study")
- Improved knowledge-based prompt to return empty responses for generic study names
- Implemented desktop study detail pane expansion feature with smooth transitions
- Added responsive layout that expands detail pane to 80% width when clicked (20% for results)
- Created collapsed SearchResults view showing study images/logos in card format maintaining height
- Added sticky chevron button to collapse back to 50/50 split instead of clicking results area
- Improved UX by not collapsing when selecting different results - stays expanded until manually collapsed
- Moved collapse button to fixed position at top-right of results panel, outside scroll area for always-visible access
- Simplified collapsed results view to show normal cards with content hidden below image line for cleaner sliding effect
- Refactored to use absolute positioning overlay approach - results stay at 50% width, detail pane overlays with flexbox
- Added subtle drop shadow to detail pane when expanded for better visual hierarchy
- Moved collapse button to detail pane (top-left) with click event prevention to avoid triggering detail click
- Added blue borders on both left and right sides of selected result cards for visibility when detail pane is expanded
- Enhanced filter panel with hybrid chips/autocomplete component for categorical filters with frequency data
- Implemented get-keyword-phrases API endpoint integration for intelligent alpha calculation based on study names and abbreviations
- Modified search logic to use alpha=0 for queries matching keyword phrases instead of heuristic word-count based calculation
- Updated all fetchResultByUuid calls to include alpha parameter for consistent search behavior across lookup operations
- Simplified related datasets table to show only dataset name, number of variables, and time coverage
- Updated dataset links to open internal pages at /items/{slug} instead of external URLs
- Enhanced /items/{slug} route to support both slugs and UUIDs for child datasets from lookup API
- Added UUID detection logic to automatically handle datasets without slugs
- Fixed static generation issue by adding return_variables_within_parent=false parameter to dataset search API calls
- Updated generateStaticParams to create pages for both slug and UUID versions of each dataset
- Fixed UUID detection to recognize hash-based IDs (32 hex characters) in addition to proper UUIDs with dashes
- Optimized static generation to only pre-compile child datasets from studies instead of all datasets
- Simplified dynamic page rendering to use direct API lookups instead of searching through all studies
- Enhanced fetchResultByUuid to support both UUID and slug lookups with automatic fallback
- Simplified static generation to build studies by both slug and UUID (with UUID redirects to slug)
- Updated child dataset pages to use StudyDetail component with proper data transformation
