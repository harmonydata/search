A key motivation was her desire to provide students with data, enabling more teaching time to focus on developing skills in data analysis. SN 5271  has been used in this way.  This collection represents the subset of interviews specifically selected for teaching purposes. \n\nThe British Migrants in Spain: the Extent and Nature of Social Integration, 2003-2005: Teaching Data study is based on British Migrants in Spain: the Extent and Nature of Social Integration, 2003-2005 (available under SN 5271). The teaching data collection is a subset of the interviews in SN 5271 and was created for learning and teaching purposes.\n\nThe interviews comprising the teaching data collection were selected based on criteria such as the data quality and the ability to divide the data collection into subsamples of a manageable size (e.g. by participant characteristics, geography, or other features) for student projects. Characteristics used to define this subset were gender and employment status (retired, self-employed and employee).\n\nStudents were then asked to write 4,000 word reports based on their analyses of these subsamples.
