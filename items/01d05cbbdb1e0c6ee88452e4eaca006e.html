The Harmonized Histories is an international comparative dataset, created through harmonising data from existing surveys into one common format. The aim of
Harmonized Histories is to facilitate cross-national research on topics related to transition to adulthood, family formation, and childbearing. The dataset focuses on fertility and partnership histories but also captures information on socio-economic status, place of residence and information on the childhood family. You can find more information about
Harmonized Histories and access to the datasets from other countries via the Generations &amp; Gender Programme (GGP) website.





Two datasets are provided. The first includes all people aged 16 or over who participated in the full interview of Wave 1 of the
Understanding Society project and the data as is collected at Wave 1. The second dataset follows the people who are in the first dataset prospectively. Thus, it includes all the retrospective information from the first dataset and has been updated when things changed, for instance the partners got married or had children. For more information please refer to the User Guide.

Harmonized Histories uses
Understanding Society for data on the UK. As Harmonized Histories is a cross-national project, please note that the variable naming conventions and terminology used in this dataset are different to the standard
Understanding Society naming and terms.
