12:Tb54,PIONEER:  The impact of ethnicity and multi-morbidity on COVID-related outcomes; a primary care supplemented hospitalised dataset
Dataset number 3.0

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified in January 2020.  Currently, there have been more than 65million cases and more than 1.5 million deaths worldwide.  Some individuals experience severe manifestations of infection, including viral pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.  Evidence suggests that older patients, those from some ethnic minority groups and those with multiple long-term health conditions have worse outcomes.  This secondary care COVID dataset contains granular demographic and morbidity data, supplemented from primary care records, to add to the understanding of patient factors on disease outcomes. 

PIONEER geography
The West Midlands (WM) has a population of 5.9 million & includes a diverse ethnic & socio-economic mix. There is a higher than average percentage of minority ethnic groups. WM has a large number of elderly residents but is the youngest population in the UK.  Each day >100,000 people are treated in hospital, see their GP or are cared for by the NHS. The West Midlands was one of the hardest hit regions for COVID admissions in both wave 1 and 2.

EHR. University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) is one of the largest NHS Trusts in England, providing direct acute services & specialist care across four hospital sites, with 2.2 million patient episodes per year, 2750 beds & 100 ITU beds. UHB runs a fully electronic healthcare record (EHR) (PICS; Birmingham Systems), a shared primary & secondary care record (Your Care Connected) & a patient portal “My Health”.  UHB has cared for >5000 COVID admissions to date.  

Scope: All COVID swab confirmed hospitalised patients to UHB from January – May 2020.  The dataset includes highly granular patient demographics & co-morbidities taken from ICD-10 & SNOMED-CT codes but also primary care records and clinic letters.  Serial, structured data pertaining to care process (timings, staff grades, specialty review, wards), presenting complaint, acuity, all physiology readings (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations), all blood results, microbiology, all prescribed & administered treatments (fluids, antibiotics, inotropes, vasopressors, organ support), all outcomes.  Linked images available (radiographs, CT, MRI, ultrasound). 

Available supplementary data:
Health data preceding and following admission event. Matched “non-COVID” controls; ambulance, 111, 999 data, synthetic data.

Available supplementary support: Analytics, Model build, validation & refinement; A.I.; Data partner support for ETL (extract, transform & load) process, Clinical expertise, Patient & end-user access, Purchaser access, Regulatory requirements, Data-driven trials, “fast screen” services.13:Tb54,PIONEER:  The impact of ethnicity and multi-morbidity on COVID-related outcomes; a primary care supplemented hospitalised dataset
