It examined how gender shaped the political discourses of Latin American independence. Some of the research questions were: What were the links between politics and sexual difference? How were women constructed as subjects and objects in contemporary political discourse? What were women's political culture and associational life, where did they take place, and how were they manifested? How did women respond to Republican discourse of individual rights? What were the contradictions in Latin American political discourse which arose from its formulations of gender categories?\nThe methodology was interdisciplinary and text-based involving archival retrieval and discourse analysis. The research scope was continental. Research was undertaken in Latin America, namely in Buenos Aires, Lima, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago de Chile, and Quito.
