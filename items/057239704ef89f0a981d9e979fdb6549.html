The Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission (AEBC), itself a novel institutional innovation, signalled the need for such a debate in 2002. Accordingly, the public debate was steered by an independent subcommittee of AEBC, which was named 'GM Nation? The Public Debate'.\n\nIn November 2002, the 'Understanding Risk' team at the University of East Anglia were appointed as independent evaluators of this important exercise experiment in participatory democracy concerning the possible commercialisation of GM crops in the UK.
