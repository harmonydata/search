12:T9bf,The research conducted explored both the promise and perils of social economy organisations delivering online services to citizens. An in-depth research case study was conducted; focussing on the development of Freegle (see case study background) - a social economy organisation providing an online waste reduction and prevention service - over a five year period. The research findings highlighted that the promise of such social economy organisations, within a wider ecosystem of eGovernment, to: combine the logics of commerce, social enterprise and the grassroots (i.e. supporting hybrid organisational forms); build social capital; and, deliver services at a national scale. However, research findings also highlighted that such organisations also face considerable challenges in the form of pressures to become more business-like, which in turn erode their distinctive and hybrid characteristics. Furthermore, the process of becoming more business-like is hugely time consuming and can detract from the delivery of online services to citizens.

Data collection: During the project data were collected from two sources: (1) publically available online data relating to the development of Freegle; and (2) interviews with Freegle activists. Only data collected through interview was suitable for archiving with UKDS, as the online data was subject to copyright and other reuse restrictions. Permission to archive interview transcripts was sought after the participants had the opportunity to review the transcript.The research conducted highlighted both the promise and perils of social economy organisations delivering online services to citizens.
