12:T4a9,The collection of data in these studies is part of a larger study on the decline of the Scottish cotton industry.  The primary aim of the project was to answer questions regarding the causality and chronology of decline in the cotton industry.  Since economic historians have viewed the decline of the Scottish cotton industry as a consequence of poor productivity it was decided to explore the relationship between capital and labour and in particular, the gender structure of the cotton mill. To examine the extent of employer-owned housing in Paisley as part of a wider analysis of paternalism. Paternalism; employer's ownership of properties; occupations of residents.
This dataset is derived from the Valuation Rolls of Paisley with additional census information on households.  The dataset consists of one file which lists all the residential properties owned by thread manufacturers for the decennial years 1871-1911 and includes limited information about the occupants. This file also contains data extracted from the Valuation Rolls for the decennial years 1871 and 1891 which is linked to census information in order to establish a link between occupations and tenancy of a property.13:T4a9,The collection of data in these studies is part of a larger study on the decline of the Scottish cotton industry.
