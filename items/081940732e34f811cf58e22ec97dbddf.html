The study is being conducted in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam and has tracked the lives of 12,000 children over a 20-year period, through 5 (in-person) survey rounds (Round 1-5) and, with the latest survey round (Round 6) conducted over the phone in 2020 and 2021 as part of the Listening to Young Lives at Work: COVID-19 Phone Survey.Round 1 of Young Lives surveyed two groups of children in each country, at 1 year old and 5 years old. Round 2 returned to the same children who were then aged 5 and 12 years old. Round 3 surveyed the same children again at aged 7-8 years and 14-15 years, Round 4 surveyed them at 12 and 19 years old, and Round 5 surveyed them at 15 and 22 years old. Thus the younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children through into adulthood, when some will become parents themselves.The 2020 phone survey consists of three phone calls (Call 1 administered in June-July 2020; Call 2 in August-October 2020 and Call 3 in November-December 2020) and the 2021 phone survey consists of two additional phone calls (Call 4 in August 2021 and Call 5 in October-December 2021) The calls took place with each Young Lives respondent, across both the younger and older cohort, and in all four study countries (reaching an estimated total of around 11,000 young people).The Young Lives survey is carried out by teams of local researchers, supported by the Principal Investigator and Data Manager in each country.Further information about the survey, including publications, can be downloaded from the Young Lives website.

The Listening to Young Lives at Work: COVID-19 Phone Survey, Fourth and Fifth Call, 2021 is an adapted version of the Round 6 survey with additional questions to directly assess the impact of COVID-19. The 2021 survey consists of two phone calls (Fourth Call and Fifth Call) with each of our Young Lives respondents, across both the younger and older cohorts, and in all four study countries (reaching an estimated total of around 11,000 young people). The Phone Survey will enable Young Lives to inform policy makers on the short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, and together with data collected in further survey rounds, Young Lives will be able to assess the medium and long term implications of the crisis.

Young Lives survey is an innovative long-term project investigating the changing nature of childhood poverty in four developing countries. The study is being conducted in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam and has tracked the lives of 12,000 children over a 20-year period, through 5 (in-person) survey rounds (Round 1-5) and, with the latest survey round (Round 6) conducted over the phone in 2020 and 2021 as part of the Listening to Young Lives at Work: COVID-19 Phone Survey.Round 1 of Young Lives surveyed two groups of children in each country, at 1 year old and 5 years old. Round 2 returned to the same children who were then aged 5 and 12 years old. Round 3 surveyed the same children again at aged 7-8 years and 14-15 years, Round 4 surveyed them at 12 and 19 years old, and Round 5 surveyed them at 15 and 22 years old. Thus the younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children through into adulthood, when some will become parents themselves.The 2020 phone survey consists of three phone calls (Call 1 administered in June-July 2020; Call 2 in August-October 2020 and Call 3 in November-December 2020) and the 2021 phone survey consists of two additional phone calls (Call 4 in August 2021 and Call 5 in October-December 2021) The calls took place with each Young Lives respondent, across both the younger and older cohort, and in all four study countries (reaching an estimated total of around 11,000 young people).The Young Lives survey is carried out by teams of local researchers, supported by the Principal Investigator and Data Manager in each country.Further information about the survey, including publications, can be downloaded from the Young Lives website.\n\nThe Listening to Young Lives at Work: COVID-19 Phone Survey, Fourth and Fifth Call, 2021 is an adapted version of the Round 6 survey with additional questions to directly assess the impact of COVID-19.
