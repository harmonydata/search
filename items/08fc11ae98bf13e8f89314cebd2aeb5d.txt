12:T99c,This dataset is connected to the ESRC-funded project “Mapping Spatial Practices and Social Distancing in Smart Schools: Sensory and Digital Ethnographic Methods” (March 2021- February 2023). This project was funded in an Innovative Methods call to develop new methods of researching lived experience in secondary schools and with an emphasis on new learning environments (OECD, 2017). Thus, the data will be of interest to researchers who: (a) are engaged in interdisciplinary research across education, architecture, design, and potentially with an interest in school buildings and learning environments, (b) seek to develop eco-sensory and affective methods that focalise on the problematic of researching immanent, affective and atmospheric aspects of life in school buildings, and/or (c) aim to develop participative and speculative design methods with youth on environmental perception and transformation. In this respect, the folder contains ethnographic data collected in a secondary school in Liverpool, including interviews to staff, and eco-sensory data documenting the school building. This includes: 360 photographs, lidar scans, photographs, flow animations of the building. There is also a set of eco-sensory data generated in participative d workshops with a group of 14 students in Year 12. This includes: lidar scans, AR videos, atmospheric maps, navigational videos, a 4-type eco-sensory data collected with the SUPERPOWER app organised in a spread sheet, photographic documentations of conceptual prototypes proposing building transformations created by students, drawn maps that further elicit the prototypes. Descriptions of the methods and protocols applied to the data collection are included in the respective folders. The folder also contains artifacts connected to the data analysis, including speculative maps and speculative 3D digital prototypes. The maps include: one map of living landscapes formed inside the school building, and one map of space-times mapping the journeys of students to school. Both maps have their keys. There is a map that presents the transformation of the urban territory around the school in the past 100 years. The 3D digital prototypes include images of the prototypes, a video animation and memos of how the prototypes connect and extend. Finally, in terms of dissemination, the folder contains drafts of publications finalised and in-process, and posters created for an exhibition of the project.13:T99c,This dataset is connected to the ESRC-funded project “Mapping Spatial Practices and Social Distancing in Smart Schools: Sensory and Digital Ethnographic Methods” (March 2021- February 2023).
