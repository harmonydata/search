12:T53c,The surveys were commissioned to provide information about disability for use in planning policies and services.
The aims of the surveys were to:
estimate the prevalence of disability among adults and children in Northern Ireland;
assess the circumstances under which people with disabilities live;
provide figures which could be compared with figures produced by OPCS from the surveys of disability in Great Britain.
Standard Measures
Measurement of disability and definitions of disability used followed those used by OPCS in their surveys of disability in Great Britain (1988). OPCS' definition of disability followed that used by the World Health Organisation.  Adults and children:
information of 13 types of disability arising from physical, mental, behavioural or emotional impairments; use of health and personal social services; use of disability equipment, aids and adaptations; accommodation and difficulties experienced with it; extra personal  costs of disability; mobility and the use of transport; leisure activities; income and benefits; household finances; financial situation;
Adults only:
education and employment; the effect of disability on those in/not in paid work;
Children only:
assessment of special education needs and statementing; discovery of child's disability; effect of the child's disability on the family.13:T53c,The surveys were commissioned to provide information about disability for use in planning policies and services.
