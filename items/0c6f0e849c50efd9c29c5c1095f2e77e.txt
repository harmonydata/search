12:Tcee,This dataset includes research grant data from funders of palliative and end of life care research, between January 2015 and October 2022, that are relevant to the top 11 James Lind Alliance Palliative and end of life care Priority Setting Partnership (PeolcPSP) priorities identified in 2015. Mapping is illustrated through two key colours (showing direct or indirect mapping according to level of relevance of grant to priority). A key is provided in the dataset.

NOTE: This is not a comprehensive portfolio of all palliative and end of life care funding. It shows only those grants mapped to the top 11 priorities.

The UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC) Health Research Classification System (HRCS) 2018 dataset revealed that only 0.21% of all non-commercial health-related project and programme research funding is spent on PEoLC research (UKCRC HRCS, 2020; Marie Curie, 2020).
