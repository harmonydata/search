12:T69d,It has been demonstrated that gender has a subtle and pervasive influence upon attitudes and behaviour that should be included in any comprehensive model of vote choice.  This study was designed to provide further understanding of the way gender effects political attitudes and voting behaviour.
The survey was administered to 6,000 members of the YouGov internet survey panel. In total, 2,890 people responded to the survey. Yougov's weighting variable (encompassing age, gender, social class, region, newspaper readership and past vote) is included in the dataset.
The dataset includes the usual measures of political attitudes such as left/right position, socialist/laissez-faire position, liberal/authoritarianism, egalitarianism and partisanship. Also included are psychological measures of gendered attributes, which is very unusual for political science data, and permits an analysis that looks beyond biological sex and considers the social construction of gender. The dataset also includes basic demographic measures, alongside measures of parenthood and caring responsibilities, which allow a detailed analysis of how the realities of people's lives impact upon their political attitudes and behaviour.
Further information about the study can be found on the  ESRC award page and the  project web page. Respondents were asked about their interest in politics, partisan identification, vote choice and general political attitudes. The dataset also includes basic demographic measures, as well as measures of parenthood and caring responsibilities, and psychological measures of gendered attributes.
A number of the items on the questionnaire were measured on five-point Likert scales.13:T69d,It has been demonstrated that gender has a subtle and pervasive influence upon attitudes and behaviour that should be included in any comprehensive model of vote choice.
