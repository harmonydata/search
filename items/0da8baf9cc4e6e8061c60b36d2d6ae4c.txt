12:Tce4,We took a sequential mixed-methods approach. First, drawing upon the principles of Participatory Action Research, we conducted stakeholder-led (i.e. student-led) focus groups with a diverse group of 13 students to explore their experiences of social connectedness at university before, during, and beyond the pandemic (Study 1). We conducted three rounds of focus groups (3-5 participants per group) using a semi-structured template. This yielded qualitative data in the form of transcripts. ***(Focus groups .zip)***

Then, we used themes emerging from the focus group data to inform an online survey about social connectedness to test the generalisability of the focus group results in 44 students (Study 2). This yielded both quantitative (closed question) and qualitative (open question) data. ***(Online survey .zip)***

Qualitative data derived from focus groups conducted with students on their experiences of loneliness and social connectedness at university. Quantitative data from an online survey on student experiences of loneliness and social connectedness.If we learnt one thing from the Covid-19 pandemic, it is the importance of social connection. Social connectedness and belonging are essential for mental health and wellbeing. Loneliness, however, predicts mental ill-health and has been identified as a main cause of mental ill-health in students. Therefore, the Student Mental Health Charter highlights improving social connectedness at university as a priority. During the Covid-19 pandemic and associated restrictions, it became even more important to understand studentsâ€™ experiences of social connectedness. How did students experience social connection under the Covid-19 restrictions, and what lessons can be taken forward as we move on from the pandemic?

It is important to improve social connectedness in all students, not just those experiencing mental ill-health. This is because social connectedness plays a role in *preventing* the onset of mental ill health. As such, Smarten (The Student Mental Health Research Network), funded several projects to develop non-clinical and universal approaches to improving student mental health. 

This project won funding from Smarten. The project involves pilot research to inform future development of a social campus app for students. We took a sequential mixed-methods approach.
