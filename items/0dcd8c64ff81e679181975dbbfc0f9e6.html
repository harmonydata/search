Background data: socio-demographic and economic characteristics of respondents and their households.
Neurotic symptoms; psychiatric diagnoses; physical illnesses; economic activity; financial circumstances; difficulties with activities of daily living; experience of recent stressful life events; extent of social support from family and friends; participation in leisure activities; cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption and problems, drug use and dependence.
Respondents scoring over a threshold score on the assessment for neurotic disorders were also asked questions about use of services and receipt of treatment.
Standard Measures
Clinical Interview Schedule - revised (CIS-R): a battery of questions covering the presence of, and severity of 14 symptoms of neurotic disorder. Responses lead, via algorithms, to diagnosis of neurotic disorders according to ICD-10 criteria.  See reports for further details.
Psychosis Screening Questionnaire (PSQ): sift questionnaire covering 6 items indicative of psychosis.
