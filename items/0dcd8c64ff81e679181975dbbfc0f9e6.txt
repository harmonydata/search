12:Tc80,The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys (APMS) (formerly known as the Surveys of Psychiatric Morbidity) are a series of surveys which provide data on the prevalence of both treated and untreated psychiatric disorders in the adult population (aged 16 and over). The first survey was conducted in 1993, covering 16 to 64-year-olds. A further survey was conducted in 2000 (covering 16 to 74-year-olds) and included respondents living in England, Scotland and Wales. From 2007 onwards, the surveys have been commissioned by NHS Digital on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), including people aged over 16 (no upper age limit) living in England. For 2007 and 2014, the surveys were conducted by NatCen Social Research on behalf of NHS Digital. The surveys capture information on common mental disorders, mental health treatment and service use, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorder, autism, personality disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, alcohol, drugs, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, self-harm, and comorbidity.Further information can be found on the NHS Digital Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys webpage.A similar series covering young people aged 5 to 15/16, the Mental Health of Children and Young People Surveys (MHCYP), is also commissioned by NHS Digital. 
 The purpose of the Private Household Survey was to provide good baseline information about mental illness in Britain to help in achieving <i>health of the nation</i> targets.  The survey aims were:
1. to estimate prevalence of psychiatric morbidity
2. to identify social disabilities associated with mental illness
3. to examine use of services and receipt of care in relation to diagnosis
4. to investigate recent stressful life events associated with mental illness
5. to look at co-morbidity between mental illness and physical illness and relationships with life-style indicators such as the use of drugs, tobacco, and alcohol.  All Respondents:
Background data: socio-demographic and economic characteristics of respondents and their households.
Neurotic symptoms; psychiatric diagnoses; physical illnesses; economic activity; financial circumstances; difficulties with activities of daily living; experience of recent stressful life events; extent of social support from family and friends; participation in leisure activities; cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption and problems, drug use and dependence.
Respondents scoring over a threshold score on the assessment for neurotic disorders were also asked questions about use of services and receipt of treatment.
Standard Measures
Clinical Interview Schedule - revised (CIS-R): a battery of questions covering the presence of, and severity of 14 symptoms of neurotic disorder. Responses lead, via algorithms, to diagnosis of neurotic disorders according to ICD-10 criteria.  See reports for further details.
Psychosis Screening Questionnaire (PSQ): sift questionnaire covering 6 items indicative of psychosis.
SCAN interview (see report for further details).
