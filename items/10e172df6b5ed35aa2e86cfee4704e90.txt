12:T663,Circadian rhythms and restricted sleep length affect cognitive functions and, consequently, the performance of day to day activities. To date, no more than a few studies have explored the consequences of these factors on oculomotor behaviour. 
In this study, eye tracking data have been recorded from 24 participants performing a modified spatial cueing task under two paired conditions. The first condition concerned the time of day variations, as the task was conducted at 10am, 2pm, 6pm, and 10pm. The second condition was the sleep restriction - the subjects participated in the study twice: after one week of unrestricted sleep and after one week of chronic partial sleep deprivation. The task comprised congruent trials with target stimuli preceded with congruent directional cues (60%), incongruent trials with target stimuli preceded with incongruent directional cues (15%), and stimuli without cues (25%). Targets and cues were presented in six possible locations. Participants were instructed to direct their attention and gaze from fixation point to targets only if they were preceded by a cue. The aim of this study was to verify if chronic sleep deficit and circadian rhythm affect the number of errors in performance of saccadic task and whether this impact vary according to the type of error
The eye-tracking data are in txt format (archived to 'rar'). Overall size of the data files is about 15 GB. Data are log files form Smart Eye Pro eye tracking system. Detailed information about all recorded parameters are included in User Manual for the Smart Eye Pro system, please see manual available in this project record.13:T663,Circadian rhythms and restricted sleep length affect cognitive functions and, consequently, the performance of day to day activities.
