12:Taa1,The OECD International Trade in Services provides annual data and is presented in the following tables:

Trade in services - EBOPS 2010
This dataset aims to assemble and disseminate balance of payments data on trade in services at the most detailed partner-country and service-category level available. To the extent that countries report them, data are also broken down by type of service according to the EBOPS classification. These data cover international trade in services between residents and non-residents of countries and are reported within the framework of the sixth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual and the Extended Balance of Payments Services Classification (EBOPS2010), which is consistent with the balance of payments classification but is more detailed. Statistics by partner country and service category on international trade in services such as transportation, communication services, financial services, government services are recorded for Australia and Chile from 1999 onwards and shown in US dollars. 

Trade in services - EBOPS 2002
This dataset provides statistics on international trade in services by service category and partner country for 34 OECD countries plus the European Union (EU27), the euro area (EA17), the Russian Federation and Hong Kong, China as well as definitions and methodological notes. These data cover international trade in services between residents and non-residents of countries and are reported within the framework of the fifth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual and the Extended Balance of Payments Services Classification (EBOPS 2002), which is consistent with the balance of payments classification but is more detailed. To the extent that countries report them, data are also broken down by type of service according to the EBOPS classification. Series are shown in national currency, euros and US dollars and are recorded from 1970 onwards. 

Trade in services: national classification items
This dataset contains additional national data on international trade in services for Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Turkey and the United States. The data are reported within the framework of the fifth and sixth editions of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual and the Extended Balance of Payments Services Classification (EBOPS 2002 and EBOPS 2010), which is consistent with the balance of payments classification but is more detailed. Series are shown in US dollars and are recorded from 1970 onwards. 

These data were first provided by the UK Data Service in November 2004.
