The research focusses on meanings and experiences of donating in the context of increased openness in the context of UK donor conception, including the removal of donor anonymity for new donors since 2005. As part of this project, we interviewed 52 donors (half men, half women) and 23 relatives of donors (partners, parents and siblings). In addition, we analysed UK laws and policies which impact donors and interviewed 18 members of staff who work with donors in UK clinics. The project was approved by the University of Manchester Research Ethics Committee.In a culture that emphasises the importance of genetic connectedness and which holds that vital and enduring family relationships pass through genetic reproduction, the decision to give away one&#x27;s eggs or sperm is radical indeed. This is however something that is becoming increasingly common as more people struggle with issues of infertility, and the fertility industry is growing. Questions arise about how donors experience the process of donating and how that process impacts on their everyday lives and relationships. 

Whereas, in the past, donors were anonymous and so could choose to keep their donation a secret from close kin, recent legal changes mean that donors are now identifiable. In 2023, the first children born through &#x27;identity release&#x27; egg or sperm donors will be able to seek contact. Donors nowadays are therefore likely to deliberate on how to manage such openness and contact within the context of their own relationships with partners, parents and their own children. Being open may not be a straightforward task.

This is a sister project to our previous study Relative Strangers (funded by the ESRC 2010-2013, C Smart PI, P Nordqvist, CI) which explored family life after receiving donor egg and sperm. This showed the impact of donor conception on family relationships and raised unforeseen questions about donors, suggesting that giving away (as opposed to receiving) egg and sperm may impact on family relationships in significant ways. 

Proposed study and research focus: The Curious Connections study explored how donating impacts on donors&#x27; everyday lives and relationships. The study: 1) analysed the policy on donation and the rights and obligations of donors 2) examined how egg and sperm donors negotiate donation within the context of their everyday lives and relationships, and also if and how they share information with close kin 3) explored how close kin react to and experience the existence of donor offspring 4) investigated the similarities and difference between male and female donors&#x27; experiences 5) considers what the practice of sperm/egg donation as a practice can tell us about contemporary kinship and family cultures

Approach and methods: This study took the donor as a starting point, but in order to better understand the process and family dynamics that underscore donors&#x27; experience, it looked beyond the donor and situates donating within the context of their close relationships. We utilised a qualitative approach, enabling us to explore donors&#x27; experiences and understandings. We analysed existing policy on donors and conducted 88 qualitative semi-structured interviews with 52 donors (26 with egg donors, ,26 sperm donors and 1 embryo donor), 23 close kin (partners, parents and siblings) and 18 fertility counsellors or donor coordinators.

Beneficiaries and impact: A range of policy makers, practitioners, user groups, users and the general public stand to benefit from this study. Sought outcomes include increasing the effectiveness of policy and better targeted practical support and information offered to donors and families by donor conception. The impact will be realised through a range of pathways, e.g. a conference, a public debate, a podcast, blogs, films and through the production of findings-based user group leaflets. Academic communities also stand to benefit from this research, including those in the field of reproductive technologies and reproduction more broadly, sociologists of family life and intimacy, and medical sociologists."/><meta property="og:title" content="Curious Connections: The Impact of Donating Egg and Sperm on Donors&#x27; Everyday Lives and Relationships, 2017-2020"/><meta property="og:description" content="This dataset comprises transcripts of interviews generated through the Curious Connections study, which explores the impact of donating egg or sperm for donors and their relatives.

dataset comprises transcripts of interviews generated through the Curious Connections study, which explores the impact of donating egg or sperm for donors and their relatives. The research focusses on meanings and experiences of donating in the context of increased openness in the context of UK donor conception, including the removal of donor anonymity for new donors since 2005. As part of this project, we interviewed 52 donors (half men, half women) and 23 relatives of donors (partners, parents and siblings). In addition, we analysed UK laws and policies which impact donors and interviewed 18 members of staff who work with donors in UK clinics. The project was approved by the University of Manchester Research Ethics Committee.In a culture that emphasises the importance of genetic connectedness and which holds that vital and enduring family relationships pass through genetic reproduction, the decision to give away one's eggs or sperm is radical indeed.

Questions arise about how donors experience the process of donating and how that process impacts on their everyday lives and relationships. \n\nWhereas, in the past, donors were anonymous and so could choose to keep their donation a secret from close kin, recent legal changes mean that donors are now identifiable. In 2023, the first children born through 'identity release' egg or sperm donors will be able to seek contact. Donors nowadays are therefore likely to deliberate on how to manage such openness and contact within the context of their own relationships with partners, parents and their own children. Being open may not be a straightforward task.\n\nThis is a sister project to our previous study Relative Strangers (funded by the ESRC 2010-2013, C Smart PI, P Nordqvist, CI) which explored family life after receiving donor egg and sperm. This showed the impact of donor conception on family relationships and raised unforeseen questions about donors, suggesting that giving away (as opposed to receiving) egg and sperm may impact on family relationships in significant ways. \n\nProposed study and research focus: The Curious Connections study explored how donating impacts on donors' everyday lives and relationships. The study: 1) analysed the policy on donation and the rights and obligations of donors 2) examined how egg and sperm donors negotiate donation within the context of their everyday lives and relationships, and also if and how they share information with close kin 3) explored how close kin react to and experience the existence of donor offspring 4) investigated the similarities and difference between male and female donors' experiences 5) considers what the practice of sperm/egg donation as a practice can tell us about contemporary kinship and family cultures\n\nApproach and methods: This study took the donor as a starting point, but in order to better understand the process and family dynamics that underscore donors' experience, it looked beyond the donor and situates donating within the context of their close relationships. We utilised a qualitative approach, enabling us to explore donors' experiences and understandings. We analysed existing policy on donors and conducted 88 qualitative semi-structured interviews with 52 donors (26 with egg donors, ,26 sperm donors and 1 embryo donor), 23 close kin (partners, parents and siblings) and 18 fertility counsellors or donor coordinators.\n\nBeneficiaries and impact: A range of policy makers, practitioners, user groups, users and the general public stand to benefit from this study. Sought outcomes include increasing the effectiveness of policy and better targeted practical support and information offered to donors and families by donor conception. The impact will be realised through a range of pathways, e.g. a conference, a public debate, a podcast, blogs, films and through the production of findings-based user group leaflets.
