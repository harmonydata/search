12:T68b,This project aimed to find out how being outdoors changes teaching and learning in Year 1. Four classes in two urban schools (involving children aged 4-6 years old) were involved, with children wearing felt bags containing digital records to naturally observe their vocal interactions. These audio recordings of children were transcribed. Face-to-face interviews with teaching staff were also conducted along with observations, photographs and videos of outside activities. What is it like to be a child aged 5 or 6 moving from Foundation Stage to Year 1? The aim of this research will consider ways in which children are given opportunities to shape their learning in outdoor environments over this key period in their foundation and primary schooling.
Our research concerns outdoor contexts for learning and explores the different ways that teachers might teach in external environments and the ways in which children (aged 4-6 years) learn from the pedagogical processes occurring outdoors. Undertaking observations and interviews the study has two main aims; firstly to explore what teaching and learning in outdoor contexts in the Foundation Stage (FS) and year 1 of primary school are like and how they come about; and secondly, to understand how interactions between teacher, child and place might help children make a successful move between these educational stages.
Fundamentally the study will look to identify how changes in learning objectives between the Foundation Stage and Key Stage 1 may influence teaching and learning practices and how place, in particular outdoor contexts, may interact with staff and children to construct ways of teaching and learning.13:T68b,This project aimed to find out how being outdoors changes teaching and learning in Year 1.
