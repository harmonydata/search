2d:Ta0d,The 1961 Census Microdata for Great Britain: 9% Sample: Secure Access dataset was created from existing digital records from the 1961 Census. It comprises a larger population sample than the other files available from the 1961 Census (see below) and so contains sufficient information to constitute personal data, meaning that it is only available to Accredited Researchers, under restrictive Secure Access conditions. See Access section for further details.

The file was created under a project known as Enhancing and Enriching Historic Census Microdata Samples (EEHCM), which was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council with input from the Office for National Statistics and National Records of Scotland. The project ran from 2012-2014 and was led from the UK Data Archive, University of Essex, in collaboration with the Cathie Marsh Institute for Social Research (CMIST) at the University of Manchester and the Census Offices. In addition to the 1961 data, the team worked on files from the 1971 Census and 1981 Census. 

The original 1961 records preceded current data archival standards and were created before microdata sets for secondary use were anticipated. A process of data recovery and quality checking was necessary to maximise their utility for current researchers, though some imperfections remain (see the User Guide for details). 

Three other 1961 Census datasets have been created; users should obtain the other datasets in the series first to see whether they are sufficient for their research needs before considering making an application for this study (SN 8275), the Secure Access version:SN 8272 - 1961 Census Microdata Individual File for Great Britain: 5% Sample, which contains information on individuals in larger local authorities;SN 8273 - 1961 Census Microdata Household File for Great Britain: 0.95% Sample, which links household members together to allow individuals to be understood within their household context. SNs 8272 and 8273 are both available to registered UK Data Service users based in the United Kingdom (see Access section for non-UK access restrictions); and SN 8274 - 1961 Census Microdata Teaching Dataset for Great Britain: 1% Sample: Open Access, which can be used as a taster file and is freely available for anyone to download under an Open Government Licence. The file contains information on individuals in local authorities and counties. Topics covered include demographics, for example family and household circumstances, employment and qualifications, migration, commuting, car ownership, and housing.29:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2d"}]
