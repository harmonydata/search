Cohort members have been surveyed throughout their childhood and adult lives, mapping their individual trajectories and creating a unique resource for researchers. It is one of very few longitudinal studies following people of this generation anywhere in the world.Since 1970, cohort members have been surveyed at ages 5, 10, 16, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, and 51. Featuring a range of objective measures and rich self-reported data, BCS70 covers an incredible amount of ground and can be used in research on many topics.

Key findings include how reading for pleasure matters for children&#x27;s cognitive development, why grammar schools have not reduced social inequalities, and how childhood experiences can impact on mental health in mid-life.

1970 British Cohort Study: Age 16, Sweep 4, 1986
The purpose of the 16-year follow-up was to review and evaluate adolescent (mid-teenage) health, care, education, social and family environment throughout Great Britain, as experienced by the BCS70 cohort. At the same time, a parallel survey was also conducted with head teachers of schools likely to be attended by cohort members. The main impetus behind this was to find out more about these schools, especially as many of the cohort members were about to leave full-time education. The head teacher questionnaires were not able to be keyed, documented and deposited at the time of the survey due to lack of resources, but funding finally became available in 2004/5 to complete this task at CLS. The resulting dataset is archived under SN 5225.Latest edition informationFor the ninth edition (September 2022), a derived dataset (bcs70_age16_school_type) has been added, which includes age 16 school type data for the entire BCS cohort. This is derived from STYPE (BCS4), B9SC16TP (BCS9) and the 1986 School Census. A user guide describing this variable in full has also been added. In addition, the derived variable BD4STYPE has been removed from the data file bcs4derived.  
 Subjects covered include:

cohort members: exercise and sport; hygiene; diet (including 4-day diary); activity diary (4-day); leisure activities; family life; religion; leaving home; money; smoking; alcohol; laterality; television, video and radio; friends and social behaviour; law and order; sexual behaviour; self-esteem; health status; medical history; attitudes to health and emotions; drug use; school; occupational interests; reading, spelling and vocabulary tests; mathematics tests; life-skills test (education, training and employment)parents: health status; family health; chronic illness and disability; medication; accidents and injuries; use of health services; social experience; father&#x27;s occupation; mother&#x27;s occupation; parental situation; family finances; household amenities; accommodation type; number of rooms; neighbourhood; alcohol consumption; smoking; performance at school; life skills; behaviourmedical: special requirements; chronic illness and disability; psychological/psychiatric problems; medical examination; blood pressure; distant and near vision tests; motor co-ordination tests; audiometry; height and weight; head circumferenceschool: curriculum; teaching methods; special education; teacher&#x27;s assessment of behaviour; academic achievement; academic potential; absences from school

sample of over 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1970. Cohort members have been surveyed throughout their childhood and adult lives, mapping their individual trajectories and creating a unique resource for researchers. It is one of very few longitudinal studies following people of this generation anywhere in the world.Since 1970, cohort members have been surveyed at ages 5, 10, 16, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, and 51. Featuring a range of objective measures and rich self-reported data, BCS70 covers an incredible amount of ground and can be used in research on many topics. Evidence from BCS70 has illuminated important issues for our society across five decades. Key findings include how reading for pleasure matters for children's cognitive development, why grammar schools have not reduced social inequalities, and how childhood experiences can impact on mental health in mid-life. Every day researchers from across the scientific community are using this important study to make new connections and discoveries.BCS70 is run by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS), a research centre in the UCL Institute of Education, which is part of University College London.

Evidence from BCS70 has illuminated important issues for our society across five decades. Key findings include how reading for pleasure matters for children's cognitive development, why grammar schools have not reduced social inequalities, and how childhood experiences can impact on mental health in mid-life. Every day researchers from across the scientific community are using this important study to make new connections and discoveries.BCS70 is run by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS), a research centre in the UCL Institute of Education, which is part of University College London.

The main impetus behind this was to find out more about these schools, especially as many of the cohort members were about to leave full-time education. The head teacher questionnaires were not able to be keyed, documented and deposited at the time of the survey due to lack of resources, but funding finally became available in 2004/5 to complete this task at CLS. The resulting dataset is archived under SN 5225.Latest edition informationFor the ninth edition (September 2022), a derived dataset (bcs70_age16_school_type) has been added, which includes age 16 school type data for the entire BCS cohort. This is derived from STYPE (BCS4), B9SC16TP (BCS9) and the 1986 School Census. A user guide describing this variable in full has also been added.

Cohort members have been surveyed throughout their childhood and adult lives, mapping their individual trajectories and creating a unique resource for researchers. It is one of very few longitudinal studies following people of this generation anywhere in the world.Since 1970, cohort members have been surveyed at ages 5, 10, 16, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, and 51. Featuring a range of objective measures and rich self-reported data, BCS70 covers an incredible amount of ground and can be used in research on many topics.
