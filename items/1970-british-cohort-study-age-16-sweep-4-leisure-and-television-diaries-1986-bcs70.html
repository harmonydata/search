Cohort members have been surveyed throughout their childhood and adult lives, mapping their individual trajectories and creating a unique resource for researchers. It is one of very few longitudinal studies following people of this generation anywhere in the world.Since 1970, cohort members have been surveyed at ages 5, 10, 16, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, and 51. Featuring a range of objective measures and rich self-reported data, BCS70 covers an incredible amount of ground and can be used in research on many topics. Evidence from BCS70 has illuminated important issues for our society across five decades. Key findings include how reading for pleasure matters for children&#x27;s cognitive development, why grammar schools have not reduced social inequalities, and how childhood experiences can impact on mental health in mid-life. Every day researchers from across the scientific community are using this important study to make new connections and discoveries.BCS70 is run by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS), a research centre in the UCL Institute of Education, which is part of University College London. The content of BCS70 studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website.How to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:For information on how to access biomedical data from BCS70 that are not held at the UKDS, see the CLS Genetic data and biological samples webpage.Secure Access datasetsSecure Access versions of BCS70 have more restrictive access conditions than versions available under the standard End User Licence (EUL). 
The 1970 British Cohort Study: Age 16, Sweep 4 Leisure and Television Diaries, 1986 study was part of the BCS70 Age 16 follow-up survey known as &#x27;Youthscan&#x27;, available at the UK Data Archive under SN 3535, where respondents completed two diaries; one of leisure activities, and the other of television viewing, over a consecutive four-day period (Friday-Monday).Of the 11,622 cohort members who completed one or more sections of the 16-year 
Youthscan study, 7,243 (62 per cent) attempted to complete a leisure diary. Some only 
managed two or three of the four days. Others left parts of the diary blank or provided entries 
that were illegible. 75 per cent of the diaries were collected between June and September, July being the most frequent month.6,946 cohort members completed a television diary over the relevant four-day period.
The leisure and television diary data have not hitherto been available for analysis.
The leisure and television diary data are available as four separate datasets:leisure diary episode - an episode being defined as the period of time during which the activity, location and the co-presence with others does not changeleisure diary calendar - gives a five-minute by five-minute account of all the diary fieldsleisure diary aggregate - contains totals of the number of minutes per day spent in each of forty main activity groupstelevision diary event"/><meta property="og:title" content="1970 British Cohort Study: Age 16, Sweep 4 Leisure and Television Diaries, 1986 / BCS70"/><meta property="og:description" content="The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) is a longitudinal birth cohort study, following a nationally representative sample of over 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1970.
