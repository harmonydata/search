It also collects this information from a variety of sources, including clinical records, medical examinations, nutrition and activity diaries, parents, teachers and cohort members themselves.\n\nFindings from the study have been used to understand some of the most persistent challenges facing UK society, and have been a vital source of evidence on key policy areas such as social mobility, education, training and employment and economic insecurity. \n\nStudy website: www.cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1970-british-cohort-study","url":["","https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1970-british-cohort-study/","https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1970-british-cohort-study/)","https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.cls.bcs70/75fe4705-0c94-4f75-b1e6-ad9c61ffde26","https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=BCS70","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=BCS"],"keywords":["Covid-19 data collection","Biomarkers","Cognitive measures","Work and employment","Puberty","Social care - receipt","Political and social attitudes","Parenting and family","Social care - provision","Sexuality and gender identity","Migration and immigration","Education","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Reproductive health","Language and literacy","Physical health assessment","Housing","Sleep problems","Social care - need","Victimisation and life events","Diet and nutrition","Neighbourhood"],"identifier":["https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jhealeco.2009.10.003","https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyl174","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-016-0767-z"],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"CLOSER Discovery","url":"https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.cls.bcs70/75fe4705-0c94-4f75-b1e6-ad9c61ffde26","image":"https://closer.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/closer-2022/www/images/closer-logo-full.svg"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies","url":"https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration: UK LLC","url":"https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=BCS70","image":"https://ukllc.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/ukllc-theme/assets/images/UKLLC_Logo_Landscape_Black.svg"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=BCS","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"}],"publisher":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Centre for Longitudinal Studies, UCL Institute of Education"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) - Institute of Education (IoE), UCL"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Professor George Ploubidis"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"UCL"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) - Institute of Education (IoE), UCL"}],"funder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Economic and Social Research Council"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"ESRC RCOG\nNational Birthday Trust Fund"}],"copyrightHolder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"UCL"}],"license":["https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/series/series?id=200001","https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/data-access-training/access-ukds/"],"image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/BCS.png","size":"18460"},"extra_data":{"keywords":["Covid-19 data collection","Biomarkers","Cognitive measures","Work and employment","Puberty","Social care - receipt","Political and social attitudes","Parenting and family","Social care - provision","Sexuality and gender identity","Migration and immigration","Education","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Reproductive health","Language and literacy","Physical health assessment","Housing","Sleep problems","Social care - need","Victimisation and life events","Diet and nutrition","Neighbourhood"],"study_design":[],"instruments":[],"resource_type":"study","country_codes":["GB"],"source":["ukllc","closer","cls","ukds","hdruk","mhc"],"name":"1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70)","uuid":"492057ed65e8bc0e7cada6297729b277","number_of_variables":41686},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]}]}}]]}]
