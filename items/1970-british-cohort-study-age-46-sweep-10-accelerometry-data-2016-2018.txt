This is the first time accelerometry has been included on BCS70.17:Tb11,The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) is a longitudinal birth cohort study, following a nationally representative sample of over 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1970. Cohort members have been surveyed throughout their childhood and adult lives, mapping their individual trajectories and creating a unique resource for researchers. It is one of very few longitudinal studies following people of this generation anywhere in the world.Since 1970, cohort members have been surveyed at ages 5, 10, 16, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, and 51. Featuring a range of objective measures and rich self-reported data, BCS70 covers an incredible amount of ground and can be used in research on many topics. Evidence from BCS70 has illuminated important issues for our society across five decades. Key findings include how reading for pleasure matters for children's cognitive development, why grammar schools have not reduced social inequalities, and how childhood experiences can impact on mental health in mid-life. Every day researchers from across the scientific community are using this important study to make new connections and discoveries.BCS70 is run by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS), a research centre in the UCL Institute of Education, which is part of University College London. The content of BCS70 studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website.How to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:For information on how to access biomedical data from BCS70 that are not held at the UKDS, see the CLS Genetic data and biological samples webpage.Secure Access datasetsSecure Access versions of BCS70 have more restrictive access conditions than versions available under the standard End User Licence (EUL). 
1970 British Cohort Study: Age 46, Sweep 10 Accelerometry Data, 2016-2018The aim of the BCS70 Age 46 follow-up (see SN 8547) was to collect key details of the cohort members’ lives including their socio-economic circumstances (e.g. household composition, cohabiting relationships, housing, economic activity, and income) and their health (physical health, mental health, medication, and health behaviours). This survey had a significant biomedical focus, with objective health measurements and assessments being conducted for the first time in the cohort members’ adulthood.Activity Monitor Data:Free-living physical activity and sedentary behaviour can be measured objectively using a combination of thigh inclination and acceleration.  Accelerometers are electro-mechanical devices that measure acceleration force. Cohort members were asked to wear thigh-worn accelerometers for one week as part of the Age 46 Survey.
