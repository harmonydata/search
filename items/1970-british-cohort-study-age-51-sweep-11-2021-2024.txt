SN 9347 - 1970 British Cohort Study: Age 51, Sweep 11, 2021-2024The main aim of the Age 51 Survey was to gather information to understand midlife outcomes across various life domains and their determinants over the life course, building on the wealth of data collected in previous sweeps.
 The Age 51 Survey collects information on many aspects of cohort members' lives including employment, relationships, health and wellbeing, cognition, politics, attitudes, caring responsibilities, as well as capturing pensions and finances.The Age 51 Survey involved asking study members to complete an interview (mostly either in-person, or by video call with non-responders and emigrants being asked to complete a shortened web version). The main interview included a self-completion section containing the most sensitive questions, cognitive assessments and consent to data linkage. In addition to the main interview, participants were asked to complete a paper-self-completion questionnaire and an Online Dietary Questionnaire (ODQ).19:Tb35,The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) is a longitudinal birth cohort study, following a nationally representative sample of over 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1970. Cohort members have been surveyed throughout their childhood and adult lives, mapping their individual trajectories and creating a unique resource for researchers. It is one of very few longitudinal studies following people of this generation anywhere in the world.Since 1970, cohort members have been surveyed at ages 5, 10, 16, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, and 51. Featuring a range of objective measures and rich self-reported data, BCS70 covers an incredible amount of ground and can be used in research on many topics. Evidence from BCS70 has illuminated important issues for our society across five decades.
