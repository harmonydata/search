A process of data recovery and quality checking was necessary to maximise their utility for current researchers, though some imperfections remain (see the User Guide for details). Three other 1971 Census datasets have been created:
SN 8269 - 1971 Census Microdata Household File for Great Britain: 0.95% Sample, which links household members together to allow individuals to be understood within their household context, and is available to registered UK Data Service users based in the United Kingdom (see Access section for non-UK access restrictions);SN 8270 - 1971 Census Microdata Teaching Dataset for Great Britain: 1% Sample: Open Access, which can be used as a taster file and is freely available for anyone to download under an Open Government Licence; andSN 8271 - 1971 Census Microdata for Great Britain: 9% Sample: Secure Access, which comprises a larger population sample and so contains sufficient information to constitute personal data, meaning that it is only available to Accredited Researchers, under restrictive Secure Access conditions. The file contains information on individuals in larger local authorities. Topics covered include demographics, for example family and household circumstances, employment and qualifications, migration, commuting, car ownership, and housing.27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2b"}]
