The UK comprises the countries of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.Statistics from the UK censuses help paint a picture of the nation and how we live. They provide a detailed snapshot of the population and its characteristics, and underpin funding allocation to provide public services. The aggregate data produced as outputs from censuses in Great Britain provide information on a wide range of demographic and socio-economic characteristics. They are predominantly a collection of aggregated or summary counts of the numbers of people or households resident in specific geographical areas possessing particular characteristics.The topics covered by the 1991 Census were virtually the same as those in the 1981 Census. However, new questions were introduced on limiting long-term illness, ethnic group, central heating and term-time address of students. Also a question on weekly hours worked was re-introduced.The 100% Sample files include information about total population; population in private households and communal establishments; sex; age; marital status; country of birth; ethnicity; migration; employment status; economic activity; household composition; dependent children; dependant adults; long-term illness; household car availability; housing; housing tenure; housing amenities; central heating; linguistic ability (Welsh/Gaelic in Wales and Scotland respectively).The 10% Sample files contain information about socio-economic composition; employment status; occupations; industry of occupation; hours of work; commuting; qualifications, family type; household composition; age; sex; marital status; ethnicity; housing tenure; social class.Local Base Statistics (LBS)The 1991 Census Local Base Statistics (LBS) have around 20,000 statistical counts (cells) contained in 99 tables and cover the complete range of topics in the 1991 Census. They form the basis of the tables to be reproduced for each county (in England and Wales) and region (in Scotland) and for each local authority district. The LBS are available down to ward level in England and Wales and postcode sector level in Scotland.Small Area Statistics (SAS)The 1991 Census Small Area Statistics (SAS) tables are an abbreviated version of the Local Base Statistics. They comprise around 10,000 counts for each area and are available as an abstract of some 86 tables for geographic areas down to Enumeration District level in England and Wales and Output Area level in Scotland.Data can be accessed through CKAN (to bulk download data).Citation: Office of Population Censuses and Surveys; General Register Office for Scotland; Registrar General for Northern Ireland (1997): 1991 Census aggregate data (Edition: 1997).
