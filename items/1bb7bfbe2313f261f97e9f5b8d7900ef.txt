12:T750,The dataset was assembled for a research project on the growth and economic impact of overseas multinational enterprises in Britain during the interwar period. The project examined the impact of protectionism on the expansion of overseas multinationals in Britain, the development of public policy towards in-coming multinationals, the location of new multinational plants, and the Trades Union Congress campaign against employment practices that were perceived to be typical of overseas-based enterprises. The data consist of three tables:

CIA provides information on 117 overseas-based manufacturers that made enquiries, between November 1931 and April 1932, about setting up British production and which subsequently established British plants (based on the records of the Office of the Chief Industrial Adviser).

BRIT provides information on 19 British firms that made enquiries, between November 1931 and April 1932, about establishing joint ventures with overseas-based manufacturers or importing foreign technology, and subsequently established manufacturing production as a result of these enquiries (based on the records of the Office of the Chief Industrial Adviser).

HANSARD contains less detailed information on 275 overseas-based manufacturers that established British production during the 18 months following the Abnormal Importations Act, November 1931 and April 1933 (based on parliamentary answers printed in Hansard).

Main variables include: name, country of origin, parent company, product manufactured, 1980 Standard Industrial Classification, employment details, reasons for migrating to Britain, value of capital and machinery imported, location in Britain (available to varying degrees of detail).

Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research.13:T750,The dataset was assembled for a research project on the growth and economic impact of overseas multinational enterprises in Britain during the interwar period.
