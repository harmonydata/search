12:T7b0,The main aims of the project were:
1. To produce and make available a database of material in the Dyffryn Clwyd court rolls, in the form of a calendar in English;
2. To carry out detailed analysis of the data processed;
3. To investigate and apply new methods of handling and analysing large quantities of medieval historical data.
This dataset improves upon and supersedes Welsh Society in the Fourteenth Century : The Evidence of Court Rolls (SN 2979).
  The dataset consists of a English language calendar of the medieval Latin court rolls.  Each court roll is held as a separate file and each entry within the roll is generally held as a separate record within the file.  The variables in the main calendar include: manuscript class reference and membrane number; record number; name of the court; date; persons named in entry; the calendar of entry with the persons in the preceding variable identified by the letter p and a number, together with any necessary editorial comments. The main calendar excludes information about the constables, stewards or other court presidents and the total receipts from each court which is recorded in separate files.  The dataset also includes two files of cumulative indexes of surnames and place-names and the <i>User Guide</i> includes a synonym list.
The data are held as ASCII files, but have been created using the <i>Idealist</i> for DOS program and are best suited for use with this program.
The main topics covered by this dataset include:
1. The structure of late-medieval Welsh society and the role of particular groups with in it: elites, the nature and importance of kinship.
2. Relations between English settlers and the native Welsh.
3. Small-town society.
4. Socio-economic topics: e.g. land market, the working of the local economy.
5. Socio-legal topics: e.g. pledging, use of Welsh and English legal procedures, the pattern of litigation.
6. The administration of the lordship.
7. Naming and naming patterns.13:T7b0,The main aims of the project were:
