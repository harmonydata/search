12:T992,The Secure Livelihoods Research Consortium Panel Survey, 2012-2018 is a three-wave individual panel survey (2012/13, 2015 and 2018) conducted in three countries, and two-wave individual panel survey (2012 and 2015) in two countries, by the Secure Livelihoods Research Consortium (SLRC). The SLRC is an eight-year global research programme exploring livelihoods, basic services and social protection in conflict-affected situations. SLRC was established in 2011 with the aim of strengthening the evidence base and informing policy and practice around livelihoods and services in conflict.

A separate dataset exists for each of the five countries: Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (two waves), Nepal (three waves), Pakistan (three waves), Sri Lanka (two waves), and Uganda (three waves). This survey generated two or three rounds of data on people's livelihoods, their access to and experience of basic services, experience of shocks and crimes and of food insecurity, their asset wealth, ownership of land and farming inputs, access to social protection and livelihood assistance, and their views of governance actors. 
These data provide information at two or three periods in time on individual respondents and on their household members who remained in the same dwelling as the respondent. Households were selected using different sampling methods in each country and, as such, are representative at different levels. The survey is broadly the same in each country and is the same across waves, with some minor exceptions. In particular, the third wave included additional modules to capture individuals' notions of state legitimacy and behaviour. Latest edition informationFor the second edition (August 2021) the data files for Nepal, Uganda and Pakistan were replaced with updated versions containing data for 2012, 2015 and 2018 and the documentation was also updated accordingly. The data and documentation for Democratic Republic of Congo and Sri Lanka still cover 2012 and 2015 only.
 This study covers the following topics: perceptions of government actors and legitimacy of state in fragile and conflict-affected settings; livelihoods within the household; food insecurity; asset wealth; access to healthcare, education, and water; satisfaction with healthcare, education, and water; social protection and livelihood assistance transfers; coping strategies in response to shocks and crimes; perceptions of safety at the local level.13:T992,The Secure Livelihoods Research Consortium Panel Survey, 2012-2018 is a three-wave individual panel survey (2012/13, 2015 and 2018) conducted in three countries, and two-wave individual panel survey (2012 and 2015) in two countries, by the Secure Livelihoods Research Consortium (SLRC).
