12:T614,Advanced Technology in the Lives of Disabled People, 2007-2008 assesses the use, application and role of advanced technologies in the lives of disabled people. Although disabled people are excited by the potential benefits of using new advanced technological devices at home, research has shown that one third of assistive devices are abandoned early and lie unused. This study aimed to explore why this happens, what the users actually need and how technology can rise to the challenges of flexibility and user choice. 

This study comprises 45 semi-structured interviews with people with a variety of different disabilities. In the study, 'disabled people' are people between the ages of 18 and 65 who have impairments (physical/sensory/learning difficulties/ mental health issues). 'Advanced technologies' are devices (often electronic) that assist the disabled person or improve functioning. These take many different forms, for example an automatic door opener can be attached to a closed circuit TV system, mobile telephones can act as universal pagers to alert the user to a number of environmental hazards, (for example, fire, gas escape). 

Further information can be found on ESRC MATILDAH project web page and the IDRIS research centre website. Additional information and a range of publications are available from the ESRC Award web page.
