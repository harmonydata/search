They were run by the Northern Ireland Statistics &amp; Research Agency (NISRA), National Records of Scotland (NRS), and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for both England and Wales. The UK comprises the countries of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.Statistics from the UK censuses help paint a picture of the nation and how we live. They provide a detailed snapshot of the population and its characteristics and underpin funding allocation to provide public services. This is the home for all UK census data. The 2011 Census Microdata Individual Safeguarded Sample (Local Authority): Scotland data collection forms part of the statistical outputs from the 2011 Scotland Census. A safeguarded microdata sample of individuals has been identified as a key Census user requirement, and was highlighted as part of a report specifying microdata products from the 2011 Census written by an expert user, Dr. Jo Wathan from the University of Manchester. 

The purpose of a safeguarded sample of individuals is to be able to disseminate a detailed microdata file without onerous licensing conditions, by reducing the overall amount of detail compared to the secure samples.  Whilst supplying sufficient detail on core variables to fulfil the intended aim of the microdata products, the safeguarded sample is a valuable multi-purpose research file that will be used on a wide range of projects. (For Censuses prior to 2011, these data may have been referred to as &#x27;Samples of Anonymised Records&#x27;, or SARSs.)

This safeguarded sample is of 5% of the total population at Grouped Local Authority (LA) level (Scotland), and contains a similar level of detail to the equivalent End User Licence Census 2001 Microdata samples. A similar Scotland dataset at Regional level is held under SN 7834. These samples have a low risk of disclosure; but not nil. Registered UK Data Service Census users can download the data to their laptops after agreeing terms and conditions that include constraints on data management under remote storage conditions.

Further information can be found on the Scotland&#x27;s Census Supporting Information webpage. 

Corresponding Regional and Local Authority level data for England and Wales are held under SNs 7605 and 7682, and for Northern Ireland under SNs 7769 and 7770.

 The variables cover: age; household composition and dharacteristics; provision of unpaid care; number of cars and vans; nature of (communal) establishment; central heating; client Groups; country of birth; education and qualifications; health and disability; housing and tenure; deprivation indicators; long-term health problems; distance travelled to work; children; economic Activity; employment; language skills; ethnic groups; general health; hours worked per week; national identity; marital status; household mobility; National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC); pensions; pensioner households; number of persons per room; religion; household relationships; Census return by internet or paper; social grade; sex; Single Adult Household; student accommodation; schoolchild or student in full-time education; whether usual resident, student living away, or short-term resident; unemployment history; year of arrival in UK (England and Wales)."/><meta property="og:title" content="2011 Census Microdata Individual Safeguarded Sample (Local Authority): Scotland"/><meta property="og:description" content="The UK censuses took place on 27 March 2011.
