This data can then be used to examine how MPs' positions have changed over over time in relation to Brexit. After the election these data will enable us to examine how the Brexit preferences of MPs influence representation of constituents' views, promotion, rebellion against the party whip and voting in select committees.
The purpose of this project is: (1) To enhance understanding of how Brexit continues to impact upon UK party politics and Parliament, including divisions within and between parties and the positions and preferences of newly elected MPs. (2) To consider the effect, if any, on Brexit issues that may arise from any informal cross-party arrangements during the election campaign. (3) To examine how party positions on Brexit have changed since the 2017 General Election. (4) To identify how the new Parliament may respond to Brexit, taking in to account the MPs elected and whether a new government will be able to deliver its Brexit policies. (5) By reviewing the statements of candidates, the project will examine how individual candidates and MPs present Brexit issues to their constituents and the extent to which they identify Brexit as being an important issue within their constituency. (6) By reviewing the statements of candidates on the Brexit process, and especially their views on the successes and failings of the 2017-19 Parliament we will assess the use of populist ('people versus parliament') messages, and tensions between representative and direct democracy which have been identified as a theme of the 2019 General Election.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"2019 UK General Election Candidates' and Incumbents' Positions in the UK's Referendum on Membership of the European Union, 2019-2020"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"2019 UK General Election Candidates' and Incumbents' Positions in the UK's Referendum on Membership of the European Union, 2019-2020"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/2019-uk-general-election-candidates-and-incumbents-positions-in-the-uk-s-referendum-on-membership-of-the-european-union-2019-2020"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"2019 UK General Election Candidates' and Incumbents' Positions in the UK's Referendum on Membership of the European Union, 2019-2020"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"2019 UK General Election Candidates' and Incumbents' Positions in the UK's Referendum on Membership of the European Union, 2019-2020"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
