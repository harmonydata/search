2a:T9e0,The UK Parkinson’s Audit assesses care provided to people with Parkinson's by a range of clinical specialities against evidence-based guidelines.

The audit of patient management covers elderly care and neurology services and the routine care they provide to people in connection with their Parkinson’s. Services submit data on their model of service delivery and the assessments which are routinely carried out (service audit) and data on the care provided over the last 12 months to at least twenty of their consecutive patients seen during the five-month data collection period (patient audit). No patient identifiers are collected. 

The audit is open to services across the UK which see patients for the routine review of their Parkinson’s - secondary care (non-acute) and community services. A service is self-defined - for example an individual consultant, a consultant and a specialist nurse, a group of consultants seeing the same cohort of patients, or a specialist nurse working in a community setting. There can therefore be more than one service taking part in any Trust or hospital.

The 2019 audit includes data from 266 elderly care and neurology services covering 6256 patient cases.

The data is available by UK Parkinson’s Excellence Network region. The UK Parkinson's Excellence Network is a network of health and social care professionals working to improve Parkinson's services administered with support from Parkinson’s UK. Professionals can join the Network to access resources, increase their knowledge of Parkinson's and collaborate with people affected by Parkinson's to transform health and care services. 

The audit is the recognised quality improvement tool for the Excellence Network, providing an important baseline against which progress can be measured,  informing national, regional and local service improvement priorities and plans to achieve better services for people living with the condition.
