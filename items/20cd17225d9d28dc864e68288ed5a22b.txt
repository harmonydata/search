12:Tce2,This initiative focused on identifying and improving local strategies to counteract the exclusion of migrants with precarious residential statuses from essential services. It delved into the difficulties encountered by migrants, with a special focus on women's unique experiences, the availability of services like healthcare and shelter in certain cities, and the reasons behind these provisions. Through case studies conducted in Cardiff, Frankfurt, and Vienna, in collaboration with city councils and stakeholder consultations, the initiative examined various service delivery methods within different legal environments, highlighting the cooperation between public services and civil society. Interviews were conducted with policy makers and service providers, and NGOs regarding the experiences of migrants with precarious status. A total of 21 interviews were recorded with experts in Wales, in Cardiff in particular. To reach these experts, we partnered with the city of Cardiff and were granted access to various local authorities and NGOs. The data cannot be shared due to the protocols used.This project aims at mapping and enhancing local strategies to address the exclusion from essential services of migrants with precarious residential status. It will explore the challenges migrants face, emphasising the particular experiences of women, the services available in some cities such as healthcare and shelter, and the rationales for them. Case studies in Cardiff, Frankfurt and Vienna, in partnership with city councils and consultation with stakeholders, will explore differing approaches to provision within contrasting legal frameworks, including collaboration between public services and civil society. The project will strengthen transnational networking and knowledge exchange, to inform and enhance future practice.
Migrants with precarious immigration status present a significant challenge to European municipalities. Largely excluded from work and welfare services as a matter of law, their exclusion runs counter to the socio-economic goals of urban policies, undermining strategies to promote social integration, participation and sustainable development. Groundbreaking research by the applicants, and a unique, Oxford university led, 3 year knowledge-exchange programme engaging European cities, have explored city practices towards inclusion of these migrants in municipal services. It has identified, for some cities, the rationales of policy makers for inclusion, the political, legal and logistical barriers faced, and value of partnerships with local stakeholders.
This project would significantly extend and deepen that work, in Austria, Germany and the UK, in collaboration with three city councils: Vienna, Frankfurt and Cardiff. The goal is to:
 Undertake original research, building on existing knowledge, and facilitate knowledge-exchange, on the inclusion of precarious migrants in municipal services;
 Explore forms of cooperation and co-responsibility between public and civil society stakeholders to facilitate inclusion and the realization of human rights irrespective of immigration status;
 Consider cities’ contrasting framing and legitimation of their approaches; and
 Develop with stakeholders ideas for social innovation in this field.13:Tce2,This initiative focused on identifying and improving local strategies to counteract the exclusion of migrants with precarious residential statuses from essential services.
