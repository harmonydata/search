Given the limited training available for TAs, influential researchers recently developed a framework to help TAs effectively design such a relevant practice. This ‘scaffolding’ framework encourages TAs to offer minor, neutral support, such as prompting, to students encountering difficulties completing tasks. This way, TAs maximise children’s thinking and learning. 

To further inform the scaffolding framework, this research explored TAs’ views in England. Four primary-school TAs participated in a focus group (Focus Group 1) to discuss the scaffolding framework and examples of effective teaching practices across multiple task contexts, such as open and closed tasks. To facilitate the discussion around effective practices, two videos were illustrated to the participants including a TA supporting a child with SEND; the TAs were particularly invited to use the teaching context in the videos to describe effective strategies that they might adopt in comparable circumstances.  Video 1 illustrates a TA supporting the child with SEND completing an open task, namely describing a picture, while Video 2 shows the dyad dealing with a closed task: identifying a grammar mistake in a sentence. 

The data drawn from Focus Group 1 were finally thematically analysed. To this end, the author transcribed the data verbatim and then interrogated the transcript in relation to scaffolding theories and practices. This process resulted in a list of thematic codes identifying the co-constructed meaning of effective TA scaffolding practices along with practical examples and the factors (such as types of tasks) influencing the applicability of the scaffolding framework. These research findings drawn from Focus Group 1 were finally shared with the participants in a second round of focus group discussion, Focus Group 2, for confirmation and further elaboration.

Drawing from this research, this dataset includes pseudonymised transcriptions of the two focus group discussions. Video 1 and 2 and their transcripts are excluded from the dataset. Additionally, the dataset contains demographic information of the participating TAs gathered through a questionnaire.This research programme aims to increase awareness of my PhD and its use amongst multiple audiences (e.g., politicians and scholars). To this end, academic publications, conferences, and podcast talks are used. Before describing the next project’s aims, an abstract of my PhD is produced. 
My PhD explored the classwork of teaching practitioners (TAs) internationally playing a crucial role in the mainstream education of children with SEND while teachers manage whole-class education. Whilst much of the existing research has targeted countries using TAs with limited training and a role focused on only assisting children with SEND, my study was carried out in a context (Italy) providing TAs with wealthy training and whole-class responsibilities equally to teachers. Drawing from classroom observations of a TA and interviews with 31 other TAs in Italian primary schools, the study suggested that: 
a) The TAs instructed children with SEND and infrequently managed whole-class instruction. 
b) Regardless of being well trained, they did not effectively scaffold the thinking of children with SEND – namely, they supplied children with answers to solve tasks, limiting their thinking and learning. Also, the TAs demonstrated a lack of awareness of a key sociocultural principle as to how children best learn, such as fostering their thinking by transferring them the responsibility of task completion.
Hence, the project’s plan of sharing this PhD contributes to existing knowledge of a relatively unexplored research context. Moreover, the dissemination produces guidelines for TAs as to how to design effective instructions, known as ‘scaffolding’, in Italy and beyond according to the sociocultural tenet above. Despite being based on the experience of a few TAs, sharing the PhD findings might also have important implications for Italian policymakers due to uniform employment conditions and training of Italian TAs, whereby negatively impacting the teaching of highly trained TAs like the PhD participants. Among these is the seeming need to include more training on sociocultural principles of child development in the training of TAs, alongside its existing ample provision of courses on teaching methods. This might improve TAs’ awareness of the effect of their practice on children&#x27;s learning and their teaching in practice."/><meta property="og:title" content="Effective Teaching Practices by Teaching Assistants To Support the Education of Children With Special Educational Needs and/or Disabilities, 2024"/><meta property="og:description" content="Internationally, teaching assistants (TA) support children with special needs and/or disabilities in completing classroom tasks while teachers manage whole-class instruction.

Whilst much of the existing research has targeted countries using TAs with limited training and a role focused on only assisting children with SEND, my study was carried out in a context (Italy) providing TAs with wealthy training and whole-class responsibilities equally to teachers. Drawing from classroom observations of a TA and interviews with 31 other TAs in Italian primary schools, the study suggested that: \na) The TAs instructed children with SEND and infrequently managed whole-class instruction. \nb) Regardless of being well trained, they did not effectively scaffold the thinking of children with SEND – namely, they supplied children with answers to solve tasks, limiting their thinking and learning. Also, the TAs demonstrated a lack of awareness of a key sociocultural principle as to how children best learn, such as fostering their thinking by transferring them the responsibility of task completion.\nHence, the project’s plan of sharing this PhD contributes to existing knowledge of a relatively unexplored research context.
