12:T85e,The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) is the independent regulator of nurses, midwives and nursing associates in the UK. One of our statutory responsibilities is to maintain a register of nursing and midwifery professionals that are eligible to practise in the UK.
The ‘Nursing and Midwifery Council Register’ datasets are a snapshot of the nurses, midwives and nursing associates registered as eligible to practise on the NMC register each year as of 31 March. The datasets include information we capture as part of our initial registration processes (e.g. when people join our register for the first time) and some information that people provide when they revalidate (revalidation is the process that all nurses, midwives and nursing associates in the UK need to follow to maintain their registration with the NMC).
Professionals are required to revalidate every three years and as part of this, they are required to demonstrate that they have met a number of requirements. See associated media link to the revalidation page on the NMC website for further details
How to interpret our data
• Our register tells us how many nurses, midwives and nursing associates in the UK are currently able to practise. Not everyone on our register will currently be working.
• The nursing associate role was introduced in 2019 in England only. It bridges the gap between registered nurses, and health and care assistants. Some nursing associates have registered addresses in Scotland and Wales.
• The datasets do not include any professional that has contacted us and asked not to be included in any research.
• Our register changes every day and can vary considerably from the start of the month to the end of the month. Therefore, these datasets only offers a snapshot in time taken on 31 March each year.
• We continually review the quality and content of our data and information. When improved data or additional information becomes available, we retrospectively update previously published information on our website. This means that the information provided in these datasets may differ to the information published on our website13:T85e,The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) is the independent regulator of nurses, midwives and nursing associates in the UK.
