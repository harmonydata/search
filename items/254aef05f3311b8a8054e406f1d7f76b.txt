12:Tb0b,Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence (GAGE) is a ten-year (2015-2025) research programme, funded by UK Aid from the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), that seeks to combine longitudinal data collection and a mixed-methods approach to understand the lives of adolescents in particularly marginalized regions of the Global South, and to uncover 'what works' to support the development of their capabilities over the course of the second decade of life, when many of these individuals will go through key transitions such as finishing their education, starting to work, getting married and starting to have children.GAGE undertakes longitudinal research in seven countries in Africa (Ethiopia, Rwanda), Asia (Bangladesh, Nepal) and the Middle East (Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine). Sampling adolescent girls and boys aged between 10‐19‐year olds, the quantitative survey follows a global total of 18,000 adolescent girls and boys, and their caregivers and explores the effects that programme have on their lives. This is substantiated by in‐depth qualitative and participatory research with adolescents and their peers. Its policy and legal analysis work stream studies the processes of policy change that influence the investment in and effectiveness of adolescent programming.Further information, including publications, can be found on the Overseas Development Institute GAGE website. 
Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence: Nepal Baseline, 2017-2018 includes a sample of 1,687 girls aged 12-14 years in 40 randomly selected clusters within two districts in Nepal. This sample includes 580 girls enrolled in Grade 6 and followed to Grade 8 who will help to evaluate the impact of the Room to Read (RtR) Girl's Education Program (GEP). The research sample, composed of both randomly sampled and purposely selected adolescents and their families, was recruited during 2017 and 2018 in the regions of Nuwakot and Tanahun in Nepal. Further information about the research site, sample selection, and data collection process is available in the documentation.
This study evaluates the impact of a school-based program on adolescent girls’ educational achievement and capabilities.The dataset includes information from the Adult Female (AR), Core/Child Respondent (CR), Household (HH) and School (SC) questionnaires and variables are annotated with these abbreviations to indicate the questionnaire source. Topics covered include household information, assets, children, goal setting, aspirations, gender attitudes and norms, group behaviour, opinions and decisions, mobility, social networks, educational experiences, life skills, marriage, time allocation, internet, communication, technology, safe and enabling environment, civic engagement, reference groups and role models, and school information.13:Tb0b,Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence (GAGE) is a ten-year (2015-2025) research programme, funded by UK Aid from the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), that seeks to combine longitudinal data collection and a mixed-methods approach to understand the lives of adolescents in particularly marginalized regions of the Global South, and to uncover 'what works' to support the development of their capabilities over the course of the second decade of life, when many of these individuals will go through key transitions such as finishing their education, starting to work, getting married and starting to have children.GAGE undertakes longitudinal research in seven countries in Africa (Ethiopia, Rwanda), Asia (Bangladesh, Nepal) and the Middle East (Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine).
