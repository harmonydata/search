12:T7dd,The Childcare and Early Years Survey of Parents (CEYSP) had two key objectives. The first was to provide salient, up-to date information on parents' use of childcare and early years provision, and their views and experiences of particular childcare providers and childcare provision in general. The second was to continue the time series - which has now been running for over ten years - on issues covered throughout the survey series. Approximately 6,000 parents take part. With respect to both these objectives, the study aims to provide information to help monitor the progress of policies in the area of childcare and early years education.

The survey covered the following topic areas-
For all families:
* Use of childcare in the reference term-time week and the past year
* Types of providers used for all children, and costs
* Use of and satisfaction with provision of childcare during school holidays in the past year (for families with school-age children)
* Awareness, take-up, and impacts of entitlement to free early years provision for two-, three- and four-year olds
* Awareness and receipt of tax credits and subsidies; sources of information about local childcare
* Views on affordability, availability, flexibility and quality of childcare in the local area; and childcare and working arrangements.

For one randomly selected child:
* Detailed record of childcare attendance in the reference week
* Details of main provider for selected child
* Reasons for choosing the main provider; and the home learning environment.

Classification details for all families:
* Household composition
* Demographic characteristics (for example ethnicity, qualifications, income)
* Parents' work history over the last two years (including any atypical working hours and whether this caused childcare problems)
* Classification of children according to Special Educational Needs (SEN) and disability or long-standing illness
* Housing tenure
* Contact details for childcare providers and administrative questions13:T7dd,The Childcare and Early Years Survey of Parents (CEYSP) had two key objectives.
