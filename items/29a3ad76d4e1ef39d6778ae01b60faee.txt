12:T6be,The Which Burglary Security Devices Work for Whom and in What Context? study emerged due to the urgency to gain insights about the cost-effectiveness of burglary devices for tailor-made preventive interventions. After the Home Office figures showed a 14% annual increase in domestic burglaries in 2010/11, in 2012 the Department for Communities and Local Government has highlighted the need of research evidence on this matter to inform the on-going deliberation on national building regulation for minimum standards for security in homes.

The objective of the project from which this study has originated was to analyse the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW), formerly the British Crime Survey (BCS), data from 2008/2009 to 2011/2012 merged with selected standardised Census data on area characteristics for a better understanding of this topic. The project investigated the cost-effectiveness of 9 burglary devices: Burglar alarm, CCTV, Door double locks or deadlocks, DummY alarm box, External lights on a timer or sensor, Indoor lights on a timer or sensor, Security chains, Window bars or Grilles and Windows locks. More information about this project can be found on its Gateway to Research page and in the Documentation section below.

This study consist of three datasets focusing on the combination of different security devices as it follows: 
External lights on a timer or sensor, Indoor lights on a timer or sensor, Windows locks and Door double locks or deadlocks (EIWD);
External lights on a timer or sensor, Windows locks and Door double locks or deadlocks (EWD);
Windows locks and Door double locks or deadlocks(WD).
