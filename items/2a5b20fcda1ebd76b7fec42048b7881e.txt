12:Td6f,Dataset consisting of: (a)	pupil attainment tests, tests of ability, and self-rating questionnaires (N=1252, SPSS file); (b) transcripts of 21 classroom lessons on video; and (c) teacher self-evaluation responses transcripts (N=94) 

The main purpose of the ACTS II (Activating Children’s Thinking Skills in Sustainable Thinking Classrooms) project was to create and develop a pedagogy to improve learning in primary schools, through enhancing children’s thinking skills across the curriculum. ACTS adopted an infusion methodology where the goals of enhancing thinking and subject/topic understanding were simultaneously pursued. The theoretical perspective with regard to children’s learning focused on the development of their metacognitive capacities - on their ability to become proactive about their learning in terms of planning, monitoring and appraising their thinking. Three strands of investigation were pursued within this framework. In a longitudinal design over three school years (N=1252 pupils), the first study evaluated an intervention process to enhance children’s thinking and learning, and the effects on pupils’ learning outcomes was appraised at four points in time (baseline, end-of-first year, end-of-second year, end-of-third year). Pupil outcome measures included reading and mathematics attainment, measures of ability, and self-rated questionnaires about learning strategies and motivations. In a second study, 21 thinking lessons were video recorded to identify features of classroom dialogue likely to mediate the development of metacognition. The final strand aimed to design a professional development programme for teachers, to write curriculum materials, and to create longer term strategies for sustaining thinking classrooms. Using structured questionnaires with open-ended responses, 94 teachers evaluated the impact of the programme on children’s thinking, on their classroom processes, and on the image of themselves as teachers.The project will create and evaluate practical teaching strategies to improve classroom learning in primary schools, through enhancing pupils’ thinking skills across the curriculum. The research examines the role of metacognition in teaching thinking skills. The term ‘metacognition’ refers to people’s knowledge about thinking which helps them to effectively manage their thought processes in learning and problem solving. Classroom dialogue is thought to play a key role in teaching this form of intellectual management. The project will focus on assessing and promoting appropriate dialogue and will analyse critical features in terms of improving learning outcomes for both pupils’ and teachers.
Three interrelated studies will be conducted. The first will develop and evaluate a framework for analysing metacognitive features of teachers’ and pupils’ classroom dialogue. The second study will evaluate the effects of a metacognitively-rich intervention on pupils’ and teachers’ learning. The third study will develop longer term strategies for sustaining thinking classrooms.
The project builds on the achievements of the ACTS (Activating Children’s Thinking Skills) project in Northern Ireland and will generate training materials in a variety of forms for teaching thinking skills which teachers can apply to their own practice and which will also be valuable for teacher trainers, education authorities and curriculum support units13:Td6f,Dataset consisting of: (a)	pupil attainment tests, tests of ability, and self-rating questionnaires (N=1252, SPSS file); (b) transcripts of 21 classroom lessons on video; and (c) teacher self-evaluation responses transcripts (N=94)
