12:T765,To establish houshold travel patterns prior to the introduction of a car sharing scheme (1979), and then, for a subset of respondents who began car sharing and a control who did not, to establish the extent of any changes in travel patterns between 1978, 1979 and 1981. The `Before' survey established personal characteristics and journey patterns prior to the introduction of a car sharing scheme, while the `After' survey deduced changes from recall questions and by comparison with the `Before' survey.  1) <i>Before</i> survey of employees
Modes of travel to and from work; diversions en route to and from work; work hours; journey duration length and variability; home end constraints on journey timing; household size; number of workers in household; household car availability; use of cars during week by household members; use of public transport during the week by household members; household telephone ownership; age band; sex and work status of respondent; willingness to complete household travel diary.
2) Household travel diaries 1978/1979 and 1981
Household identification (to tie diary data to household characteristics gathered from <i>Before survey</i>); for each household member, driving licence tenure, details of each trip they made during the survey week; whether or not a member of that household had joined the Yorkshare car sharing scheme between the two surveys.
3) Leeds City Council <i>After</i> survey
Changes in household travel for various purposes (work, school and other) and by various modes; work hours; distance to work; size of household and numbers of workers; household driving licence tenure; respondents' need for a car at work; mode of work journey; method by which any non-household passengers were first contacted; respondents' age band, sex and job status. Where relevant, these questions were asked for the time of the survey and 'one year ago'.13:T765,To establish houshold travel patterns prior to the introduction of a car sharing scheme (1979), and then, for a subset of respondents who began car sharing and a control who did not, to establish the extent of any changes in travel patterns between 1978, 1979 and 1981.
