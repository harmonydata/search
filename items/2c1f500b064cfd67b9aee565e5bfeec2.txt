12:T86e,The Arrestee Survey, 2003-2006, was the first nationally representative survey of drugs and crime among the population of individuals representing arrest events in England and Wales. The survey aimed to provide information on a range of areas within the drugs and crime nexus, including the prevalence of problematic drug misuse among respondents representing arrest events; drug and/or alcohol consumption; availability of drugs; levels of demand (met and/or unmet) for drug and alcohol treatment services among respondents; levels of intravenous drug use among respondents; and gang membership. 

The objectives of the survey were to provide the following:measurement of the prevalence and change in problematic drug misuse among a sample of individuals representing arrest events in England and Walesinformation to allow monitoring of drug use within drug-using groups that are likely to be under-represented in household surveysindividual-level data for the purpose of researching the behavioural links between drug and/or alcohol consumption and criminal offences leading to arresta means to estimate the level of demand (met and/or unmet) for treatment services among the problematic drug/alcohol user populationmonitoring information on the level of intravenous drug use among arrestees to better inform harm reduction programmesa means for routine collection of custody suite information for the purpose of analysing arrestee flows and the process of being in custody, and for analysing the characteristics and offending histories of individuals entering the Criminal Justice System (CJS)For the second edition (October 2011), the weight variables (arrfreqw2 and arrfreqw3) have been updated to include weights for the survey years 2005-2006.
 Topics covered include: demographic characteristics; arrest, prison history and past contact with CJS; offending and offence categories; drug and alcohol use; drug purchasing and availability; drug and alcohol treatment needs; treatment offered and received; and gang involvement. Some of the above questions were answered by self-completion questionnaire, and an oral fluid (saliva) sample was also taken.13:T86e,The Arrestee Survey, 2003-2006, was the first nationally representative survey of drugs and crime among the population of individuals representing arrest events in England and Wales.
