Since then it has run annually and has also been developed to include further elements, including a child element and a longitudinal element.

Further information can be found on the gov.uk Taking Part web pages.

For Taking Part, 2019-2020, also known as Year 15 of the continuous survey, 7,502 adults and 620 children aged 11-15 were interviewed. Information was also collected from parents or guardians of 834 children aged 5-10. Interviews were conducted face-to-face in home by specially trained interviewers working on behalf of NatCen and Ipsos MORI using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).

This study is subject to restrictive Special Licence (SL) access conditions as it contains additional detailed geographic variables (ACORN Group; ONS Urban-Rural Classification). The End User Licence (EUL) version which is the same, but excludes these detailed variables, is available from the UK Data Service under SN 8745. Users are advised to first obtain the standard EUL version of the data to see if they are sufficient for their research requirements. The SL data have more restrictive access conditions; prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version.In addition, a study titled Taking Part Web Panel Data: Engagement During the COVID-19 Pandemic, 2020 is available under SN 8744.
Latest edition informationFor the second edition (January 2024), the data and documentation for the web panel have been added.


Main topics covered by the survey include: the arts, museums and galleries, libraries, archives, heritage, sport, volunteering, charitable giving, general free time activities, digital activities, community participation, personal well-being and demographics. Almost all of these topics appear in the main adult and child data sets. Personal well-being is not covered in the child dataset (although children aged 11-15 are asked about their level of happiness)."/><meta property="og:title" content="Taking Part: the National Survey of Culture, Leisure and Sport, 2019-2020; Adult and Child Data: Special Licence Access"/><meta property="og:description" content="The Taking Part survey collects data on many aspects of leisure, culture and sport in England, as well as an in-depth range of socio-demographic information on respondents.
