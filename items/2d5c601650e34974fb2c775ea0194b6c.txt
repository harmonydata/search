12:Tb72,The main focus of the project was on the development of participative methodologies in investigating the intersection between older women’s lives and their ‘voices’; their ability to have a say about policy implementation at the micro level, within Sheffield in South Yorkshire, England. This was explored through eleven discussion groups were held, each meeting twice and involving a total of 100 older women ranging from 50-94 years, from Black-Caribbean, Irish, Chinese, Somali and white British from existing social groups and political forums. Ten women were then recruited from the discussion groups and trained to interview individual members of the groups (n47) in more details about their lives. They helped to identify key themes and continue to play a part in publicising findings from the study. These stages were filmed for a video of the project. Key service providers and policy makers (n18) were also invited to comment on issues of public participation.

Quality of life was generally expressed in terms of what was good and what difficult about participants’ lives. Positive aspects of ageing included increased self-acceptance and confidence, the easing of domestic and childcare commitments, and increased leisure and work opportunities. The importance of family was universal, and some women had taken on new roles providing childcare support for grandchildren. Few had direct experience of ‘having a say’ on policy issues. Interviews with service providers revealed awareness of and support for the principle of participation. Achievement of this aim was undermined by lack of time and funding, the pressures of national targets, differing priorities and needs across partnership organisations, and difficulties in reaching ‘hidden voices’, especially where translators were needed. They were also cynical about the ability of research to affect change. The OWLV project has also generated important lessons for participatory initiatives.13:Tb72,The main focus of the project was on the development of participative methodologies in investigating the intersection between older women’s lives and their ‘voices’; their ability to have a say about policy implementation at the micro level, within Sheffield in South Yorkshire, England.
