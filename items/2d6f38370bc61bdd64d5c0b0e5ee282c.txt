12:T770,This dataset, comprising a subset of a large-scale longitudinal study, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) (held at the UK Data Archive under SN 5151), was created as part of a study that examined the life course of the entrepreneur. Variables from the BHPS that were of interest in studying various aspects of accumulation and application of resources over the life course of the entrepreneur, their household and their business, were compiled and studied in relation to transition into and income/earnings from self-employment/entrepreneurship.  A final dataset was created by merging data from Waves 1-18 of BHPS, using the BHPS person identification number (PID). In order to integrate individual and household life course events and resources, original BHPS household data files were also merged with the individual level data following a match of the PID and the BHPS household identification number (XHID). This merged file will benefit research into entrepreneurship and self-employment that takes a life course approach.

Further information may be found on the ESRC Income from Self-employment: Development of an Innovative Life Course Model award webpage. Further information on the BHPS may be found on the Institute for Social and Economic Research BHPS website. 

 The merged dataset includes variables covering individual, household and business life courses. These include individual childhood resources (e.g. parents social class, education and employment backgrounds, childhood education), respondents' education, employment, health, life styles, wealth, household composition, household resources and responsibilities and business/self-employment details, including the size of the business, earnings from the business, ownership structures, etc. Also included are demographic/household characteristics including ethnic group, age, gender, social class and socio-economic status.13:T770,This dataset, comprising a subset of a large-scale longitudinal study, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) (held at the UK Data Archive under SN 5151), was created as part of a study that examined the life course of the entrepreneur.
