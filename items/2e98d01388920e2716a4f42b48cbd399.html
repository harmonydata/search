In 2019, the survey combined the former Employer Skills Survey and the Employer Perspectives survey.

The ESS covers topics such as employers’ internal skills challenges, including vacancies, skills lacking from applicants, skills lacking from current employees, the scale and nature of training, and business practices to best utilize employee skills, recruitment, the nature of training - plus other topics such as work placements, apprenticeships and vocational qualifications.

Data collection typically takes place every 2 years and interviews with employers are conducted on the telephone via quota sampling.
For the 2022 survey, random probability sampling was used. The sampling unit is set at the establishment level and respondents are those who are responsible for staff issues such as training, recruitment or resourcing. 

The ESS covers employers across the UK. The 2019 survey did not include Scotland, but the 2022 survey once again covers all of the UK.

Investment in Training (IiT) is a follow-up module which provides detailed estimates of employer expenditure on training. This module has been fielded in every iteration of the ESS since 2011, which were based on the Cost of Training studies in England and Northern Ireland in 2009.
