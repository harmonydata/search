12:T84a,The aim of this survey was to study public opinion and attitudes in the subject area of 'Participation', 'Nationalism' and 'Devolution'. The survey was carried out on behalf of the Royal Commission on the Constitution (Kilbrandon Commission).

For the second edition (September 2014), data and documentation have been enhanced with the creation of the Region variable from the Ward information in the documentation.  The research paper containing the findings for the study is now available and contains the map indicating regions shown to informants.  The data cover England Wales and Scotland; using the Region variable sub-sets of the Scottish and Welsh data can now also be created.

Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
Interest in, opinion of and knowledge of local/national government; contact with councillors, members of Parliament and/or large organisations (e.g. British Railways, National Health Service, large firms) for information or to lodge a complaint; opinion or degree of control the government should exercise, political efficacy; length of residence in area, perception of the region (home and other), satisfaction with services (compared with other parts of Britain); attitudes towards devolution i.e. how much autonomy should be given to regions/services; membership of clubs and/organisations

Questions asked only of Scottish respondents
Knowledge of Scottish Office, Scottish National Party, opinion of efficiency and degree of power.

Questions asked only of Welsh respondents
Knowledge of Welsh Office, Welsh National Party; opinion of efficiency and degree of power; respondents asked if they (and/or their children) spoke or understood Welsh; attitudes to teaching Welsh language were explored and opinion on use of Welsh for official notices, road signs etc.

Household classification; that is, information gathered for all members of household: tenure, age, sex, household status, employment status, occupation, qualifications/skills, industry.  Asked only of respondent and/or head of household: marital status, age finished full-time education, religion, car ownership.13:T84a,The aim of this survey was to study public opinion and attitudes in the subject area of 'Participation', 'Nationalism' and 'Devolution'.
