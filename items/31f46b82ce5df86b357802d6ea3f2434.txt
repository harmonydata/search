12:Tb41,The research project aimed to explore how universities might contribute to poverty reduction by expanding the capabilities and functionings of students in professional education, the contributions to alleviating poverty and enhancing human talent made by universities, and to contribute in policy and practice in relation to the formation of public-good capabilities. The project studied five professional departments (engineering, law, public health, social work and theology) across three South African universities with different pre and post-apartheid histories of transformation. 

Focus groups were used to study final years students in each profession. Male, female, black and white participants were interviewed. The dean or deputy dean and and head of department and one or two lecturers in each department as well as a university leader were all interviewed individually face-to-face. NGOs were selected on the basis of their relevance to particular professional groups. Representatives of key professional bodies were interviewed also. A total of 120 people were interviewed, with 23 being from the Social Work department, 19 being from the Engineering department, 25 being from the Theology department, 27 being from the Law department and 26 being from the Public Health department. 75 unique interview transcripts were formed from focus groups and individual interviews combined. 

Web and documentary materials and relevant statistical data were also gathered. 
The research focus is the transformation of higher education in South Africa to meet the challenges of poverty reduction, economic development and social transformation in the 21st century. Specifically, the lens of professionalism and professional education in universities has been identified as a measure for evaluating the barriers, bridges, negotiations and interpretations of pro-poor transformations. The project aims are: (i) To investigate the equity trajectory of higher education institutions and their role as ‘engines of reform’, using the lens of discourses of development and professional education; and (ii) to make a contribution towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MGDs) by developing a conceptual and practical application of human development and well being through professional education and graduate professionals. The Western Cape is the case study site because it is home to four South African universities, each of which has a different historical genesis. One professional site in each university will be chosen and documentary, statistical, survey and interview data collected. A research working group at each university will advise on the generation and refinement of metrics constituted by pro-poor dimensions and specific indicators to evaluate University transformation and professional education in relation to the MDGs and poverty reduction.13:Tb41,The research project aimed to explore how universities might contribute to poverty reduction by expanding the capabilities and functionings of students in professional education, the contributions to alleviating poverty and enhancing human talent made by universities, and to contribute in policy and practice in relation to the formation of public-good capabilities.
