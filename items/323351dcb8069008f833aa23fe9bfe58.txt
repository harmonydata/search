12:Tbc0,Learning from past events is essential to improve future performance and enhance safety. One method of learning is the use of incident reporting systems where employee experiences are logged, translated into lessons, and then shared for wider learning across the organisation. To enhance learning and performance within the UK Emergency Services, a national online incident reporting system has been developed: Joint Organisational Learning (JOL) Online. However, this system is underutilised. The goal of this research was to explore user experiences of JOL to provide recommendations for its redevelopment and future use. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 participants who had experience of using JOL. Using reflexive thematic analyses, we first sought to identify how to increase use of JOL. Three themes were identified: (i) create an open and safe learning culture; (ii) enhance inclusivity and usability of JOL Online; and (iii) tailor incentives to align with personal motivations for incident reporting. Second, we sought views from participants about how to facilitate the sharing of lessons from JOL Online to organisations and employees. Three themes were identified: (i) support organisations to identify applicable lessons; (ii) develop assurance mechanisms; and (iii) increase capacity and investment across the emergency sector. This research provides unique insight about how organisations can improve incident reporting systems to enhance learning, safety, and performance.Learning from past events is essential to improve future performance and enhance safety.
