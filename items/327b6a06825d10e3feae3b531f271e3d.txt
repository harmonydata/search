12:T12b2,Active labour market policies (ALMPs) are government interventions traditionally focused on moving unemployed people into work. As those ultimately in control of the employment opportunities participants are seeking to access, employers are fundamental to ALMP outcomes. However, research and policy relating to ALMP has tended to ignore employers. Focusing on UK ALMP, as enacted through Universal Credit, this research helps to advance knowledge of this topic by focusing on employer perspectives of ALMP and the conditionality that underpins it for unemployed people and workers on a low income. The research explored how ALMP is understood and experienced by UK employers, how it impacts on how businesses are run, and how employment services can work more effectively with employers, leading to better outcomes for individuals and the wider economy.

The UK's main vehicle for ALMP, and flagship policy of recent welfare reforms is Universal Credit (UC). UC is the new working age benefit for those who are either out of work or on a low income. Under UC, social security for unemployed people is conditional on claimants demonstrating work search and other work-related activities. This is underpinned by a 'Work First' approach, emphasising high volumes of applications and fast work re-entry. It also potentially involves the extension of conditionality to those in work, blurring the traditional distinction between social security claimants who are in and outside of the paid labour market .

Aims and objectives
The project had four main aims. Through qualitative semi-structured interviews with employers, policymakers and other key stakeholders, this research project:
1. explored how UK ALMP is understood and experienced by employers
2. identified how ALMP impacts UK businesses, including how they recruit, retain and progress their staff (including differences between sectors)
3. explored how the impact of ALMP on employers varies in different low pay sectors
4. explored how the public employment service can work effectively with employers to lead to better employment outcomes for claimants
