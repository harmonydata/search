12:T90c,The project was intended to investigate all forms of interpersonal violence, from common assault to murder, in the second half of the 19th century, and to attempt to differentiate and contextualise the range of violent offences. The aims of the project were to:

1. Expand and enhance historical understanding and knowledge of violence in the second half of the nineteenth century
2. Examine critically the accepted interpretation that there was a long-term decline in violence, placing special emphasis on the 1870s as a possible 'watershed' decade
3. Examine, where possible, under-reported crimes of violence directed at women and children
4. Examine contemporary reactions to and perceptions of violence
5. Provide the first full historical study of all types of violent crime which offers depth and context to studies of crime in the late twentieth century  <i>Female inmates of Strangeways prison, December 1870 to August 1873</i> 

These data consist of: the name and address of the offender; their town and country of birth; their nationality, age, height and weight at the beginning and end of their sentence, and details about their children, religion, marital status, next of kin, and previous convictions. There is also information on the dates of their sentence, the crime they were convicted of (including the location of the crime and details of the victim), the magistrate that committed them, and other comments.

<i>Prosecutions brought by Liverpool Society for the Prevention of  Cruelty to Children, March 1912 to December 1914</i>

These data are taken from a register of all prosecutions conducted by the LSPCC. In the majority of cases parents were charged with neglect of their children. Other charges include: persistent cruelty, failing to maintain; criminal assault, grievous bodily harm, ill treatment, and habitual drunkenness.

The data consist of: the name of the offender and their partner, address, number of children, offence, punishment, whether they were bound over, and other comments (such as whether there were previous convictions).

<i>Inquests held at Liverpool Coroner's Court, 1854 to 1856, 1859, 1862 to 1865</i>

The data consist of: the date of the inquest, the name of the decedent, the place and date of death, the age of the decedent at death, and the verdict given.13:T90c,The project was intended to investigate all forms of interpersonal violence, from common assault to murder, in the second half of the 19th century, and to attempt to differentiate and contextualise the range of violent offences.
