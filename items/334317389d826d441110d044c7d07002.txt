12:T75b,The Poverty and Social Exclusion in the United Kingdom project is the largest research project of its kind ever carried out in the UK. It examines levels of deprivation in the UK today. The research aims to answer the following questions:What are the best methods for measuring poverty, deprivation, social exclusion and standard of living?How are the different dimensions of poverty, deprivation and social exclusion related?What is the current extent and nature of poverty and how has it changed?What policies best address these problems?Launched in May 2010, the project comprises four main pieces of research so far:Firstly, two major surveys into the public's perceptions of necessities and into living standards were carried out in 2012/13: an attitudinal UK Omnibus survey, gathering the public's perceptions of necessities and attitudes to services (held under SN 7878); and a large-scale survey of living standards to examine the nature, extent and causes of deprivation and social exclusion (SN 7879).In addition, two qualitative research studies have been undertaken: an investigation into the experiences of living on low income during recession in Gloucestershire, the West Midlands and Strathclyde (SN 7877); and an exploration of the role of the family when coping with poverty in Northern Ireland.Further information about the project may be found on the Poverty and Social Exclusion project website.

 Focus group interviews were conducted between November and December 2010 in five different locations, including in each of the four territories comprising the UK: Bristol, Cardiff, London, Glasgow and Belfast. Separate group interviews were conducted amongst low income samples (5 groups), non-low income samples (5 groups), and mixed income samples (4 groups). These groups were also stratified by household type (11 groups) and minority ethnic status (3 groups).13:T75b,The Poverty and Social Exclusion in the United Kingdom project is the largest research project of its kind ever carried out in the UK.
