The survey covers the process from initial contact with police, through to police action and follow-up, whilst considering police treatment throughout the process. These elements feed into the main measure of 'Overall Satisfaction', and the results feed into the 'Citizen Focus' domain of Home Office measures. The Overall Satisfaction measure is further explored in order to monitor difference in satisfaction between white and black and minority ethnic (BME) groups, as well as victims of racist incidents. The results are gathered through telephone interviews with c. 18,000 victims a year, by an external market research company on behalf of the MPS. Victims are interviewed 6-12 weeks after they have reported the crime, and interviewing takes place throughout the year.
