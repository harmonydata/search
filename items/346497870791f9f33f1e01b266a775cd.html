The results of the 2007 survey provide information for DEFRA and contribute to wider government policy on many areas including climate change. They provide data that will allow assessment of current levels of behaviour in different environmental subject areas, particularly transport, energy efficiency and recycling. The data also give an insight into attitudes to the environment, and are used to cluster the population into segments that will facilitate better targeting of information and publicity.

Further information about the 2007 survey, including reports and publications, may be found on the DEFRA Public Attitudes and Behaviours toward the Environment web page.

 The main 2007 questionnaire covered: household and respondent characteristics; well-being; consumer Target Group Index (TGI) Life Values measures (for data fusion); travel behaviour; energy and water efficiency in the home; recycling, composting and reducing waste; purchasing behaviour; and awareness and attitudes in relation to the environment and climate change.

A set of additional questions, that did not fit on the main survey, were also asked in a BMRB Omnibus survey, to a sample of 1,661 respondents. These covered: further demographics; political issues that the government should prioritise; life satisfaction; gardens; visits to &#x27;green&#x27; and public spaces; visits to the countryside and attitudes to countryside management; pet and farm animal welfare; and biodiversity.

The aim of the survey was to investigate the environmental concerns, awareness and behaviour of people living in England. The previous five surveys in the series were carried out in 1986, 1989, 1993, 1996-1997 and 2001. Some questions are comparable allowing time series analysis. Users should note that the UK Data Archive currently holds all surveys in the series apart from the fourth (1996-1997).\n\nThe results of the 2007 survey provide information for DEFRA and contribute to wider government policy on many areas including climate change.
