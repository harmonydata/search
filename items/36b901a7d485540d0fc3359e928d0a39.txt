12:Tb48,The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) is a longitudinal birth cohort study, following a nationally representative sample of over 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1970. Cohort members have been surveyed throughout their childhood and adult lives, mapping their individual trajectories and creating a unique resource for researchers. It is one of very few longitudinal studies following people of this generation anywhere in the world.Since 1970, cohort members have been surveyed at ages 5, 10, 16, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, and 51. Featuring a range of objective measures and rich self-reported data, BCS70 covers an incredible amount of ground and can be used in research on many topics. Evidence from BCS70 has illuminated important issues for our society across five decades. Key findings include how reading for pleasure matters for children's cognitive development, why grammar schools have not reduced social inequalities, and how childhood experiences can impact on mental health in mid-life. Every day researchers from across the scientific community are using this important study to make new connections and discoveries.BCS70 is run by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS), a research centre in the UCL Institute of Education, which is part of University College London. The content of BCS70 studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website.How to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:For information on how to access biomedical data from BCS70 that are not held at the UKDS, see the CLS Genetic data and biological samples webpage.Secure Access datasetsSecure Access versions of BCS70 have more restrictive access conditions than versions available under the standard End User Licence (EUL).  The 1970 British Cohort Study: Age 16, Sweep 4 Arithmetic Test, 1986 includes data derived from an arithmetic test administrated in 1986, when cohort members were 16 years old.  The test used was known as the APU Arithmetic Test and consisted of 60 questions.  The test was included in the Student Test Book and cohort members recorded their answers on a machine-readable Student Score Form.  Thirty minutes were allowed for completion of the test.

For the second edition (June 2016) a small number of primary identifiers (BCSID) have been changed to realign them to previous sweeps of data. See the documentation for full details of the work done.

 The data consist of the responses for each of the 60 test items for some 3,677 cases, plus an additional 60 derived variables interpreting the answers into ‘wrong’ or ‘right’, together with 4 additional variables giving details of:total score (number of correct items out of 60)total number of incorrect itemstotal number of items attemptedpercentage score (i.e. total score * 100/60)13:Tb48,The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) is a longitudinal birth cohort study, following a nationally representative sample of over 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1970.
