12:T8d1,This is a qualitative data collection.  This project aimed to explore the meaning of wellness and resilience for older people with osteoarthritis (OA) through a year-long qualitative study.  This included looking at the relationship between resilience and use of health services; and at transitions in health experiences. A further aim was to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a longitudinal participant controlled method.

Interviews were carried out with 27 older people who reported a joint problem but rated themselves as healthy on a previous questionnaire. Diary sheets, asking about changes in health and circumstances, were sent to participants for 11 consecutive months after the first interviews. They could then choose each month whether and how to have further contact with the researchers. Of the 27 people who started in the study, five withdrew after the baseline interview and one half-way through the project when her husband became seriously ill. Most remaining participants returned all their diary sheets. Responses included brief notes, longer letters, email exchanges, two photos and a drawing. Other contact requested ranged from none through to four interviews, with most requesting a combination of phone calls and face-to-face contact. The participant-controlled method proved feasible and acceptable for participants and researchers. 

A key element of wellness was being able to keep up everyday roles and activities. This required a level of physical functioning which joint pain and stiffness from (OA) could deleteriously affect. However, respondents had many ways of minimising the impact of OA symptoms, which included working through pain. If though, symptoms did not fit with their model of ’wear and tear’ arthritis- used to categorise arthritis viewed as a normal part of old age, then they were likely to consult. Resilience was tied into wellness. Having a sense of self as someone who would be able to keep going was vital and several factors appeared to influence this, including upbringing, previous experience of adversity, social relationships and feeling known and understood by health care practitioners.
