The study had three main themes:
(1) An analysis of each woman&#x27;s perception of her problems and of her own evaluation of any &#x27;solutions&#x27; which she had been offered by her family and friends, by agencies such as the social services, the housing department, the police and the medical profession, and by the refuge and those who lived and worked there.
(2) An analysis of the changing institutional structure of the refuge, an evaluation of the extent to which the self-help principle seemed relevant to the needs of the women, and an attempt to assess the value to each woman of her stay at the refuge as a resource to help her cope with her difficulties.
(3) An analysis of each woman&#x27;s situation before, during, and after her stay at the refuge.

The follow-up interview took place between one and two years after the first interview. Interviews were also carried out with the women who were involved in setting up and running the refuge during the first two years of its existence.  In-depth interviews were also carried out with a sub-sample of women.\n\nQuantitative material from the first wave of structured questionnaire interviews comprised an early edition of this collection.\n\nThe National Social Policy and Social Change Archive (NSPSCA) at the University of Essex contains the second wave in-depth interviews in paper format.
