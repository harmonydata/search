12:Tb61,The Scottish Health Survey (SHeS) series was established in 1995. Commissioned by the Scottish Government Health Directorates, the series provides regular information on aspects of the public's health and factors related to health which cannot be obtained from other sources. The SHeS series was designed to:estimate the prevalence of particular health conditions in Scotland;estimate the prevalence of certain risk factors associated with these health conditions and to document the pattern of related health behaviours;look at differences between regions and between subgroups of the population in the extent of their having these particular health conditions or risk factors, and to make comparisons with other national statistics for Scotland and England;monitor trends in the population's health over time;make a major contribution to monitoring progress towards health targets.Each survey in the series includes a set of core questions and measurements (height and weight and, if applicable, blood pressure, waist circumference, urine and saliva samples), plus modules of questions on specific health conditions that vary from year to year. Each year the core sample has also been augmented by an additional boosted sample for children. Since 2008 NHS Health Boards have also had the opportunity to boost the number of adult interviews carried out in their area.  

The Scottish Government Scottish Health Survey webpages contain further information about the series, including latest news and publications. 

 The Scottish Health Survey, 2012 was the seventh survey in the series, designed to provide data at a national level about the population living in private households in Scotland. The NHS Health Scotland funded module of questions on knowledge, motivations and attitudes to health which was included in the 2008-2011 surveys, was discontinued in 2012. Since its inception in 1995, the SHeS interview has included a second stage follow-up visit from a survey nurse to collect biological samples and measures. This was discontinued in 2012. Instead, between 2012 and 2015, specially trained interviewers are taking many of the measurements and samples, previously collected by nurses, from a sub-sample of adult participants.

For the fourth edition (February 2020), new equivalised income derived variables based on the OECD scoring method (as included in SHeS 2015 onwards) were added to the individual file. The dataset documentation has been updated accordingly.

 The 2012 SHeS covered general health, caring responsibilities, respiratory symptoms, CVD, use of services, asthma, physical activity adults, barriers to exercise and motivations to exercise, eating habits, fruit and vegetable consumption, smoking, drinking, dental health, family health, prescription drugs, anxiety, depression and self harm. Height and weight and blood pressure measures were taken, and saliva and urine samples.13:Tb61,The Scottish Health Survey (SHeS) series was established in 1995.
