Data include details of Corporation service, respondent perception of a councillor&#x27;s main responsibilities, political party affiliation and initial political involvement. Also included are: an assessment of the respondent&#x27;s sense of political efficacy in Council matters, his opinion of the Corporation&#x27;s most important problems and recommended course of action, his awareness of public opinion on these matters, perception of local political parties, his stronger identifications (party/class, party/religion) and his suggestions for changes in the running of local government in Glasgow. He is asked whether the elimination of parties in Glasgow Corporation would alter its functioning and what he believes to be the role of pressure groups in Glasgow politics. A further question tests his affinity to the city.
As in SN:66035, the following topical local issues are considered: the proposal to have pubs in Corporation housing estates, the elimination of school fees in Corporation schools, extending parking meters in the City centre, and the increase in rates. These issues are considered in terms of flow of information received, respondent knowledge of the proposals, sources of party/organisation belonged to, respondent perception of constituent opinion and respondent&#x27;s reference group for discussion of such matters. In addition there is a question on preferences in regard to integration of Catholic and Protestant children in schools.
As in SN:66035, a section is included which tests the respondent&#x27;s perception of class and religion.
