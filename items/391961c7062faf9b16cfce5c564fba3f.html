The data focuses primarily on the value of youth work and its evaluation. The young people, youth workers and managers were from eight open youth work settings around England, selected to represent the diversity of open youth work (youth clubs in purpose built centres and shared spaces; detached / street based youth work; and open youth work with specific groups: trans young people, girls, and boys). The policy makers, influencers and informants were mostly from England. One was from Scotland and five from the USA; these perspectives were sought for comparative and international learning purposes. \n\nIn addition, the researchers engaged in 73 sessions of participant observation. 63 of these were in the eight youth work settings mentioned above.
