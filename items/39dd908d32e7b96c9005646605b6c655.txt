12:T89c,This dataset contains data from two studies on deaf children with spoken language multilingualism and professional practice. An increasing number of deaf children are being raised with multiple spoken languages; however, there is limited data available on their cognitive and language abilities, and on what advice professionals give to parents with regards to this communication choice.

The aim of Study 1 was to explore professional beliefs about a deaf child’s ability to acquire two spoken languages and what factors impact this. The study also investigated what advice professionals give to multilingual parents who are considering raising their deaf child with two spoken languages. Three professional roles were included in this study: Speech and Language Therapists, Teachers of the Deaf and Audiologists. All professionals who participated were working in the UK.

The aim of Study 2 was to examine the cognitive and language abilities of deaf children with spoken language multilingualism compared to deaf children who only speak English, hearing monolingual children and hearing multilingual children. The children were all aged between 7 and 10 years old. Cognitive abilities focused on executive function and Theory of Mind, whilst English language abilities focused on expressive vocabulary and morphosyntax. The multilingual children’s home languages were also assessed using parental reports. All the children who participated were living in the UK.An increasing number of D/deaf children are born to multilingual parents who must decide whether to raise them with spoken language multilingualism (SLM).  This dataset comprises data from two studies designed around the evidence-based practice framework to support professionals in 
their role in helping multilingual parents make informed communication decisions. The first study investigated the beliefs of 108 professionals on SLM in deaf children and what 
advice they give to parents. The second study examined the language and cognitive abilities of five deaf children with SLM compared to five 
deaf children who only spoke English (oral monolingual), five hearing monolingual children and five hearing 
multilingual children.13:T89c,This dataset contains data from two studies on deaf children with spoken language multilingualism and professional practice.
