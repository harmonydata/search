12:Tbfd,The main aim of the study was to undertake a new empirical study of voluntary activists in Britain.  More specifically, the objectives were to undertake a qualitative study to (1) generate a deeper understanding of the processes by which people become activists, (2) describe citizens’ experiences of activism and (3) understand their evaluations of participation and democracy. 
A further aim of the study was to evaluate existing rival theories of civic voluntarism from the US, Europe and the UK and to contribute to theoretical explanations of why some citizens participate while others do not.  The work of Robert Putnam and his concept of social capital was the particular focus of attention given its prominence in government and policy-making circles. 
A third aim of the study was to work with colleagues – Professors Seyd and Pattie at the University of Sheffield – by generating a subsample of activists from a Citizens’ Audit comprising a postal survey of nearly 10,000 respondents. In this way, the quantitative and qualitative studies would be linked as they will be in subsequent analysis and publications. However, Study Number 5017 is made up of the qualitative interview transcripts only.
A fourth aim was to contribute to current political debates on disillusionment and disengagement by highlighting the opportunities and constraints on participation and examine satisfactions and dissatisfactions with democracy in Britain.  It is anticipated that an in-depth knowledge of activism could contribute to policy development seeking to enhance activism in Britain. 
The final aim of the study was to locate the project alongside European research on citizenship, involvements and democracy and thereby add a comparative dimension to our understanding of the changing relationship between citizens and government.  This is feasible at a time when European and American governments are tackling the same issues around disillusionment and disengagement.



 The dataset is composed of 98 interview transcripts with voluntary activists selected from the Citizens' Audit (CA) (a postal questionnaire) conducted by Professors Seyd and Pattie at the University of Sheffield.  The interviewees were randomly selected from 713 respondents in the CA who indicated that they had spent more than 20 hours engaged in activities, in clubs, associations, groups, networks or in supporting other people during the last month.  The dataset comprises both men and women resident in cities, towns and villages in England, Wales and Scotland.  
The interviews lasted for one and a half hours on average. The semi-structured interviews were conducted with the use of an interview schedule comprising a number of topics to ensure some similarity across the sample. First, under the topic `about yourself’, the interviewees were asked some biographical questions such as marital status, family, education and job. Second, under the topic `where you live’, the interviewees were asked about their localities and the extent to which they trusted people around them.13:Tbfd,The main aim of the study was to undertake a new empirical study of voluntary activists in Britain.
