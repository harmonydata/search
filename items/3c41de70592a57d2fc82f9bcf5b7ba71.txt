12:T7ed,The Great Britain Historical Database has been assembled as part of the ongoing Great Britain Historical GIS Project. The project aims to trace the emergence of the north-south divide in Britain and to provide a synoptic view of the human geography of Britain at sub-county scales. Further information about the project is available on A Vision of Britain webpages, where users can browse the database's documentation system online.
The Great Britain Historical GIS Project has also produced digitised boundary data, which can be obtained from the UK Data Service Census Support service. Further information is available at census.ukdataservice.ac.uk There are six tables in this part of the Great Britain Historical Database :

Lee_emp holds simplified and standardised versions of the country-level employment statistics for Great Britain given in the printed census reports from 1841 to 1931, using the employment categories defined by the Standard Industrial Classification.

Emp1901m holds male employment statistics from the 1901 census for county boroughs, municipal boroughs and urban districts over 10,000 population in England and Wales.

Emp1901f holds female employment statistics from the 1901 census for county boroughs, municipal boroughs and urban districts over 10,000 population in England and Wales.

Emp1911m holds male employment statistics from the 1911 census for counties, county boroughs, municipal boroughs and urban districts over 10,000 population in England and Wales.

Emp1911f holds female employment statistics from the 1911 census for counties, county boroughs, municipal boroughs and urban districts over 10,000 population in England and Wales.

Emp1921 holds male and female employment statistics from the 1921 census for county boroughs, municipal boroughs, urban districts and rural districts, plus certain civil parishes in England and Wales.
