12:T652,The heat pump monitoring datasets are a key output of the Electrification of Heat Demonstration (EoH) project, a government-funded heat pump trial assessing the feasibility of heat pumps across the UK’s diverse housing stock. These datasets are provided in both cleansed and raw form and allow analysis of the initial performance of the heat pumps installed in the trial. From the datasets, insights such as heat pump seasonal performance factor (a measure of the heat pump's efficiency) and heat pump performance during the coldest day of the year can be used to help inform important factors such as peak demand.
This dataset provides performance data collected between November 2020 and September 2023, at data resolution of 30-minute intervals. The only documentation currently available with the study is the Excel data dictionary. Reports and other contextual information can be found on the Energy Systems Catapult website.The EoH project was funded by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. From 2023, it is covered by the new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.The UKDS also holds raw and cleansed EoH data, under SNs 9049 and 9050 respectively, and SN 9210, which includes daily heat pump performance data. Due to its size, SN 9049 has different access arrangements to SNs 9050, 9209 and 9210 - users should consult the catalogue and documentation for SN 9049 before ordering.
