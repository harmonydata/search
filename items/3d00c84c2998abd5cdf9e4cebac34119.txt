12:T91c,This project provided English-language teaching for young deaf adults in the Indian Sign Language using community, using peer tuition and a bilingual online learning environment (SLEND â€“ Sign Language to English by the Deaf). In addition, smaller pilot studies in Uganda and Ghana investigated the feasibility of using this approach for English literacy provision in these countries.
Data relating to work in India include:
a) Pre-, post- and delayed comprehension and writing tests from deaf learners, and test instruments;
b) Self-assessment skills questionnaires, and questionnaire instrument;
c) Annotations, using ELAN multimedia annotator, of filmed classroom interaction samples;
d) Written English translations of group interviews/discussions;
e) Observation notes by peer tutors in written English;
f) Frequency data automatically stored in SLEND;
g) Samples of learner-generated content on SLEND;
Data relating to work in sub-Saharan Africa include written English translations of four focus groups in Uganda and Ghana. 
The pilot project was a multi-disciplinary collaboration between academics from the areas of applied (sign language) linguistics, ethnography, digital literacy and TESOL, together with deaf-led NGO partners in India and sub-Saharan Africa. The interrelated research questions revolved around how to implement a sustainable community-based and learner-centred English literacy programme for young deaf adult learners (research question RQ1), how to measure the effectiveness of peer tuition and a virtual learning environment (RQ2), and how to conceptualise the interrelated elements of the approach (RQ3). The project took an ethnographic approach drawn from Literacy Studies in order to explore with all participants their current practices with English literacy and develop materials based on authentic identification of need ('real literacies approach', Street, 2012). Underpinning this was a commitment shared with the transformative mixed methods paradigm (Mertens, 2010) towards social justice and the furtherance of human rights. Teaching interventions were implemented at five field sites across India, and a series of exploratory scoping workshops was conducted with stakeholders in Ghana and Uganda. The project employed five deaf research assistants (RAs) and five deaf peer tutors (PTs).13:T91c,This project provided English-language teaching for young deaf adults in the Indian Sign Language using community, using peer tuition and a bilingual online learning environment (SLEND â€“ Sign Language to English by the Deaf).
