Unsurprisingly the experience of parenting can be a highly stressful and unsatisfying one (Newman, Stevenson, Bergman, \u0026 Boyce, 2007) and can worsen a vulnerable parent’s mental health (Van de Ende, 2016; Berg-nielsen, Vikan, \u0026 Dahl, 2002).\nAlthough the parenting deficits of individuals struggling with EICM have been identified, there is limited evidence as to the strengths, weaknesses, needs and hopes as described by the parents themselves. This project will utilise a qualitative design to examine the parenting experience of these individuals and the support offered in this domain. A series of semi-structured focus groups will be carried out with parents and practitioners working with parents struggling with EICM.\nData will be subject to thematic analysis as part of which parent participants will be invited to engage with the development of themes.e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Parenting experience borderline personality disorder traits: parent and practitioner perspectives 2018-2019\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$12\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"Parenting experience borderline personality disorder traits: parent and prac"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"titioner perspectives 2018-2019\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"$13\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/3d0517efd8a38c958c4ac72e9d01b95d\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:site_name\",\"content\":\"Academic Resource Discovery\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:locale\",\"content\":\"en_US\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:image:width\",\"content\":\"1200\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:image:height\",\"content\":\"630\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"og:image:alt\",\"content\":\"Parenting experience borderline personality disorder traits: parent and practitioner perspectives 2018-2019\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"website\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary_large_image\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"Parenting experience borderline personality disorder traits: parent and practitioner perspectives 2018-2019\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$14\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"17\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]]\nc:null\n"])</script></body></html>
