12:T77f,This study collected qualitative data to further understanding of parenting experience and support required by this group. This includes data collected from practitioners to incorporate their experiences in working with these parents. Data collection was structured around three research questions: (1) how do individuals with challenges around emotional intensity experience being a parent; (2) what support have they sought and experienced and how effective and appropriate has it been; and (3) what support would they like to receive/have liked to have received? Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterised by struggles in emotional intensity, changeable moods, challenges in interpersonal relationships, and an increased likelihood of self-harm. When coupled with the challenges of parenting, these characteristics can make it difficult for an individual with BPD to provide stable, responsive and nurturing care to their children and places their children at risk of a range of negative psychological and social outcomes (Petfield, 2015).  Unsurprisingly the experience of parenting can be a highly stressful and unsatisfying one (Newman, Stevenson, Bergman, & Boyce, 2007) and can worsen a vulnerable parentâ€™s mental health (Van de Ende, 2016; Berg-nielsen, Vikan, & Dahl, 2002).
Although the parenting deficits of individuals struggling with EICM have been identified, there is limited evidence as to the strengths, weaknesses, needs and hopes as described by the parents themselves. This project will utilise a qualitative design to examine the parenting experience of these individuals and the support offered in this domain. A series of semi-structured focus groups will be carried out with parents and practitioners working with parents struggling with EICM.
Data will be subject to thematic analysis as part of which parent participants will be invited to engage with the development of themes.13:T77f,This study collected qualitative data to further understanding of parenting experience and support required by this group.
