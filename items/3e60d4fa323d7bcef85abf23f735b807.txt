12:T683,The assumptions, methods and findings of dynamic poverty research are in general found to be a simplified and decontextualized version, rather than a misrepresentation of, the qualitative findings. Time formed an important part of the experience of poverty for children. It was not possible to fully match together exits from poverty with perceived improvements in circumstances, and entries into poverty with perceived deteriorations in circumstances, though this was partly due to limited recall and lack of contemporaneous knowledge. Nor were these changes clearly placed in time by respondents, in terms of duration and timing. Although most respondents did not explicitly engage with the idea of poverty as a personal experience, poverty-like accounts of disadvantage and difference were found in the accounts of all respondents. Thus, there is evidence for and against the way child poverty is currently measured, which is one of the issues tackled by the present research. 

This research project presents an analysis of the correspondence or lack of correspondence between qualitative and quantitative research on child poverty as a temporal experience. Qualitative research on poverty has not generally been informed by the insights of dynamic research, which investigates duration, timing and transitions, among other temporal topics. It is not known how far the measure of child poverty used by the government corresponds to differences in childrenâ€™s experiences. Qualitative and quantitative methods have not generally been combined in social policy research on poverty, which limits the explanatory power of both, a gap this research attempted to fill.13:T683,The assumptions, methods and findings of dynamic poverty research are in general found to be a simplified and decontextualized version, rather than a misrepresentation of, the qualitative findings.
