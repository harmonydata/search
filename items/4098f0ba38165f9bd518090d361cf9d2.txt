12:T4a6,This dataset records responses from 306 public primary school children during data collection in Rwanda in 2018.  Specifically, each pupil completed two assessments to measure their cognitive flexibility (the Dimension Change Card Sort (DCCS) and Flexible Item Selection Task (FIST)), one measure of their non-verbal reasoning (the Object Pattern-Based Reasoning Assessment (OPRA)) and one measure of their wider executive function and problem-solving skills (the Tower of Hanoi (TOH)).  The participants also completed up to four tasks to ascertain their basic reading skills and answered questions from a survey examining different family and background characteristics.  All children were assessed and surveyed one-to-one in their mother tongue, Kinyarwanda.  Data are only provided for pupils who consented to take part in the research.Doctoral Training Partnerships: a range of postgraduate training is funded by the Research Councils. For information on current funding routes, see the common terminology at www.rcuk.ac.uk/StudentshipTerminology. Training grants may be to one organisation or to a consortia of research organisations.
