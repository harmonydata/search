12:T87b,Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study follows the lives of thousands of individuals within households over time.  It is an internationally recognised study and provides vital evidence for scientists and policymakers on the causes and consequences of deep-rooted social problems.

The study commenced in 2009, building on and incorporating the long-running British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). Covering all the regions and nations of the UK, it has an initial sample of 39,802 households at Wave 1. Sample members are followed when they leave a household, and new people join the Study as they become part of existing sample member households.

Understanding Society has a number of unique design features. It covers the whole population, with boost samples to ensure it is representative of immigrant and ethnic minority groups, and its large sample enables sub-population groups to be examined. Researchers can use the household context to explore how lives link, and the relationships between family members. Its annual data collection means that changes in peopleâ€™s lives are more accurately captured over time.

Information is collected directly from everyone aged over 10 years, with parents providing information on younger children. Understanding Society asks people about things like their home and family, work and school, health and wellbeing, financial situation and their social and political attitudes. The information people share helps us to understand what people think, feel and do. It also helps us see how society is changing over time. The Study covers everyone in a household, from children to adults, so researchers can understand the experiences of the whole family over time. By 2020, nine Waves of Understanding Society data were available, with 27 years of data available for a significant sub-group who were part of BHPS. Information from the Study is used by researchers to investigate how changes in economic, social and health events affect individuals, households and communities. Evidence from the Study is extensively used by government departments, devolved administrations, agencies, charities, and think tanks.13:T87b,Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study follows the lives of thousands of individuals within households over time.
