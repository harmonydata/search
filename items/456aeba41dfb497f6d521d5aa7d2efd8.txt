12:Ta6d,The UK censuses took place on 27 March 2011. They were run by the Northern Ireland Statistics & Research Agency (NISRA), National Records of Scotland (NRS), and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for both England and Wales. The UK comprises the countries of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.Statistics from the UK censuses help paint a picture of the nation and how we live. They provide a detailed snapshot of the population and its characteristics and underpin funding allocation to provide public services. This is the home for all UK census data. Census flow data involve flows of individuals in the UK between origins and destinations. These flows are either the residential migrations of individuals from one place of usual residence to another, or of commuters making journeys from home to workplace or place of study.

These data are derived from the questions on the census form relating to usual place of residence one year ago, and the place of work for the respondent's main job. Flow data are currently available at a range of different spatial scales ranging from Output Areas to Local Authority Districts.

 The Census Support: Flow Data website facilitates access to the interaction data for members of UK higher and further education institutions. Access is provided through the Web-based Interface to Census Interaction Data (WICID).

The 2011 sets currently held include:Census migration datasets: Special Migration Statistics. Migration data at Local Authority District, Ward, and Output Area level.Special Student Statistics: Migration data at Local Authority District, Ward, and Output Area level.Census commuting datasets: Special Workplace Statistics: Commuting data at Local Authority District, Middle-layer Super Output Area, Intermediate Zone (for Scotland), Workplace Zone (for England and Wales), and Output Area level.Census second residence datasets: Special Residence Statistics. Commuting data at Local Authority District, Ward, and Output Area level.Explicit registration is not required for the 2011 Census products that have been released under the Open Government Licence. However, outputs from the 2011 Census classified as 'safeguarded' require users to agree on additional terms and conditions. Access to these datasets is only permitted via Federated Access.

The Flow Data website provides two basic routes to the data.WICID is the main route to the flow data. It provides a flexible service to download extracts of data in a variety of forms;the Downloads page allows users to download the original tables as released by ONS.Access data through the WICID Flow Data website.
