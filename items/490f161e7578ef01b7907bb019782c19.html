The survey collects information on incomes, education and labor market experience, household characteristics and various other modules for labor force participants (ages 15 to 60) in urban areas. For Ghana these areas span the four largest urban centers in the country: Accra (and neighboring Tema), Kumasi, Takoradi and Cape Coast. In Tanzania, the sample covers several of the largest urban areas including Arusha, Dar es Salaam, Iringa, Morogoro, Mwanza, and Tanga.
 
The samples were based on a stratified random sample of urban households from the 2000 census in Ghana and the 2000 Household Budget Survey (HBS) in Tanzania. While the initial sample was household based, interviews were conducted on an individual basis, and the unit of analysis can be at the individual level.

A three year panel of workers in the urban areas of both Ghana and Tanzania has already been created so a base line exists with which to compare the outcomes.

The project is designed to establish how far these policies of credit and formalisation at the level of the individual can impact on poverty either directly by raising consumption or indirectly by increasing the productivity of employment opportunities available to the poor. It is proposed to re-survey the individuals in this panel in both countries to show how these changes have impacted on their livelihoods.
