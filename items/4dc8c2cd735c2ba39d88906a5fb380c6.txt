12:T445,Understanding Society (the UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, and the survey research organisations Verian Group (formerly Kantar Public) and NatCen. It builds on and incorporates, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which began in 1991. 
This dataset contains Travel to Work Areas (TTWA) geographic variables for each wave of Understanding Society and harmonised BHPS to date, and a household identification serial number for file matching to the main data. These data have more restrictive access conditions than those available under the standard End User Licence (see 'Access data' tab for more information).
These data are consistent with the ONS Postcode Directory (ONSPD). Please see the Geographical Lookup Tables document for further details.
Latest Edition Information
For the 16th edition (November 2024), Wave 14 data have been added, and the documentation has been updated. In addition, Wave 13 data has been re-deposited with superfluous entries removed.13:T445,Understanding Society (the UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, and the survey research organisations Verian Group (formerly Kantar Public) and NatCen.
