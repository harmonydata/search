12:T8c2,The Scottish Social Attitudes (SSA) survey was launched by ScotCen Social Research (formerly the Scottish Centre for Social Research) in 1999, following the advent of devolution. Based on annual rounds of interviews of between 1,200 to 1,500 people drawn using probability sampling (based on a stratified, clustered sample), it aims to facilitate the study of public opinion and inform the development of public policy in Scotland, similar to the British Social Attitudes (BSA) series (held at the Archive under GN 33168). The SSA survey has been conducted annually each year since 1999, with the exception of 2008. The survey has a modular structure. In any one year it typically contains three to five modules, each containing 40 questions. Funding for its first two years came from the Economic and Social Research Council, while from 2001 onwards different bodies have funded individual modules each year. These bodies have included the Economic and Social Research Council, the Scottish Government and various charitable and grant awarding bodies, such as the Nuffield Foundation and Leverhulme Trust. 

Further information on the SSA and links to publications may be found on the ScotCen Social Research Scottish Social Attitudes webpages.

 The 2007 survey was the ninth wave in the series. It was designed in close conjunction with the corresponding year's British Social Attitudes Survey, though it had a number of distinct Scottish modules. The sample included a boost of addresses in remote and rural parts of Scotland.
 The 2007 survey contained modules of questions on:attitudes to government and public services in post-devolution Scotlandattitudes to drinking alcohol and the role of alcohol in Scottish cultureviews about the 2007 Scottish Parliament and Local Government elections (included a mock ballot for the local election)views on the funding, provision and delivery of public services in Scotlanddemographic and classification Standard Measures
The questionnaires contained two scales developed by researchers involved in the British Social Attitudes Survey, and British Election Study (BES) series (held at the UKDA under GN 33066); 'libertarian/authoritarian' and 'left/right'. See documentation for further details.13:T8c2,The Scottish Social Attitudes (SSA) survey was launched by ScotCen Social Research (formerly the Scottish Centre for Social Research) in 1999, following the advent of devolution.
