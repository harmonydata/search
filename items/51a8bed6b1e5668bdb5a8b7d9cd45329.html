This research design provides a rare opportunity for direct comparisons between those who stay and those who migrate, both within China and beyond its borders. We also compare Chinese students in the UK and Germany with domestic students in the same two countries. Through such comparisons we are able to address a number of theoretical questions such as selectivity in educational migrations, aspirations beyond returns, the impact of transnationalization of higher education on individual orientations and life-course expectations, and the link between migration and the wellbeing of the highly educated.\nBright Futures is a collaborative project (ESRC project number ES/L015633/1), involving researchers from the University of Essex, the University of Edinburgh, UNED, the University of Bielefeld and Tsinghua University.

Chinese students constitute the largest single group of international students in the richer OECD countries in the world, making up 20 percent of total student migration to these countries. Yet systematic research into a representative sample of these student migrants is scarce, and, more generally, theoretical frameworks for migration may not always be relevant to students moving for higher education reasons. Bright Futures is a pioneering study that investigates key dimensions of this educational mobility through large-scale representative survey research in China, the UK and Germany.
