12:T58a,The New Annual Survey Panel Dataset (NESPD) contains the New Earnings Survey (NES) data (UK Data Archive SN 6704) in panel form. The NES is sampled on individuals whose National Insurance numbers end in a given pair of digits.  Since the same pair of terminating digits are used as the basis for each year's sample, a panel is automatically generated within the surveys.

The NES is an annual survey of the earnings of employees in Great Britain. Its primary purpose is to obtain information about the levels, distribution and make-up of earnings, and for the collective agreements that cover them. It is designed to represent all categories of employees in businesses of all kinds and sizes. The questionnaire is directed to the employer, who completes it on the basis of payroll records for the employee. The earnings, hours of work and other information relate to a specified week in April of each year. The NESPD is a reduced form of the NES as it is based on a consistent variable sample.

Please see the catalogue record for UK Data Archive SN 6704 for a fuller description of the NES.

For the seventh edition (July 2017), data for 2016 have been added to the study.
