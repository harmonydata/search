12:T74f,The aim of this study was to achieve a better understanding of:
the role played by urban regeneration in altering the degree and distribution of socio-economic variations in mental health;
the impact of socio-economic changes on people with differential vulnerability to the development of common mental illness;
the measurement of subjective well-being in urban settings and what factors contribute to its improvement or maintenance during socio-economic change.  This data collection is made up of three distinct parts:

The first part consists of data collected from a postal survey carried out at baseline and follow up 18 months later. Information was collected about the individuals' mental health, quality of life (QOL), personal circumstances and consulting behaviour. Samples were taken randomly from the electoral register for the Index and Control Areas of the study.

The second part consists of data from face-to-face structured interviews carried out one year after the initial questionnaire was sent out and again twelve months later. The individuals were asked to comment on noticed changes to their locality and any changes they believed were needed. Information was also collected about their mental health and QOL. Samples were taken randomly from those individuals who had completed the postal survey and lived in the Index Area.

The third part consists of data from in-depth qualitative interviews completed towards the end of the study. The individuals involved at this stage were a sub-group of the structured interviews. These were identified as individuals who had reported changes taking place and had experienced a change in their mental health and well-being. In this interview the individuals were given the chance to talk freely about their experiences which allowed the researchers to explore the mechanisms at work from their perspective.13:T74f,The aim of this study was to achieve a better understanding of:
