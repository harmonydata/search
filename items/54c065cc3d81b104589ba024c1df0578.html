From a small collective of staff and doctoral students of colour at UEA, this jam-packed zine details their experiences of belonging in a place which can sometimes feel like home, other times like the furthest thing from it.Belonging is an emotional affiliation that relates individuals to the worlds they inhabit. The relationship between Black and minority ethnic doctoral students’ experiences of time and space and their sense of belonging at university is under-explored, despite its implications for inclusivity and academic achievement.

We propose an exploratory study utilising creative, participatory approaches to examine how everyday experiences of space and time during doctoral study impacts conceptualisations of belonging. We will build a partnership with 10-12 students from the University of East Anglia who identify across various axes of social difference. We center race/ethnicity, but acknowledge intersections of nationality, gender, sexuality, class, disability, indigeneity and lived experiences of mental health challenges, that affect belonging.

​We will co-create a project &#x27;roadmap&#x27; with students, drawing on decolonial methods. From a portfolio of methods, students can choose those that best capture their sense of spatial and temporal belonging at the university. A speculative framework will also encourage students to envision alternative conditions which may foster a greater sense of belonging.
