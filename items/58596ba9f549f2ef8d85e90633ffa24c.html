From the perspective of theorists of social change, this is either evidence of social disintegration or, contradicting this concern, the consequences of greater democracy in personal life. In either case, the trend will impact on future demands for a range of social provision such as income support, pensions, health, housing and transport. \n\nThis two-year study focused on particular sub-populations to examine the social capital and social integration, quality of life and future orientations of solos. It investigated differences in routes into and experiences and expectations of solo-livers by gender, urban-rural locality, and socio-economic circumstances.   The selected sub-populations were solo-living men and women aged 25-44 from large urban areas, remote towns and rural areas.  Scotland’s predominant rural land mass, its relatively higher rate of solo-living and lower fertility within the UK made it an obvious part of the UK in which to explore the trend in different types of urban and rural localities.  The Scottish Household Survey (SHS) (available from the UK Data Archive under GN 33333) was used as a sampling frame to strategically select solo-living men and women from localities which maximise urban/rural comparison, following the SHS rural/urban classification (large urban areas, remote small towns, accessible rural and remote rural), and by gender.  In-depth telephone interviews were carried out with 140 men and women.  Of these, 35 took part in follow-up face-to- face interviews, mainly in their own home.\n\nFurther information is available from the Rural and Urban Solo Living: Social integration, Quality of Life and Future Orientations ESRC Award web page.\n The main topics explored are: employment; education; health and disability; income/financial status; marital/parental status; route into solo living; nationality and country of birth; details of local area; social networks and activities; attitudes about solo living; future aspirations."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Rural and Urban Solo Living: Social Integration, Quality of Life and Future Orientations, 2007-2008 \"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$12\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"Rural and Urban Solo Living: Social Integration, Quality of Life and Future Orientations, 2007-2008 \"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"$13\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/58596ba9f549f2ef8d85e90633ffa24c\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:site_name\",\"content\":\"Academic Resource Discovery\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:locale\",\"content\":\"en_US\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:image:width\",\"content\":\"1200\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:image:height\",\"content\":\"630\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"og:image:alt\",\"content\":\"Rural and Urban Solo Living: Social Integration, Quality of Life and Future Orientations, 2007-2008 \"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"website\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary_large_image\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"Rural and Urban Solo Living: Social Integration, Quality of Life and Future Orientations, 2007-2008 \"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$14\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"17\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]]\nc:null\n"])</script></body></html>
