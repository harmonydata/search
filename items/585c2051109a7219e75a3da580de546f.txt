12:T8ae,A key aim of the Realigning Children's Services (RCS) programme is to improve the availability and use of evidence about local needs and services. Although local planners and practitioners often have access to good information about those already in contact with targeted or specialist services, less is generally known about the characteristics, needs and perceptions of the wider population of children and young people.With this gap in mind, the 2019 RCS programme involved two survey exercises collecting information about the health and wellbeing of children and young people aged between around 8 years old (P5) to around 16 years old (S4).Survey of primary school pupils in P5 to P7: Conducted in primary schools across the three CPPs using online Computer Assisted Self Interviewing (CASI) with audio support. Total achieved sample size of 9,317 across all three CPPs. Survey of pupils in S1 to S4: Conducted in secondary schools across the three CPPs, again using online CASI. The survey was based on and delivered in conjunction with the Schools Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance Use Survey (SALSUS). Total achieved sample size of 10,759 across all three CPPs.Further information may be found on the Scottish Government Realigning Children's Services Programme website.Secure Access versionAs well as the standard access data, two restricted datasets are included in the Secure Access version, containing the sensitive and geography variables for the Tranche 3 2019 RCS survey (see Technical Report for content). Variables include: Local Authority/CPP identifier; flag for 'in receipt of children's services and/or looked after'; free school meals; urban/rural classification. The Secondary datasets also contain a flag for 'Has an individual education plan, coordinated support plan and/or additional support need' as well as ethnicity.
The standard End User Licence (EUL) version of the data is available under SN 8766. Users should note that the Secure version is subject to restrictive access conditions, and are strongly advised to check whether the EUL version is suitable for their needs before considering an application for the Secure version.
