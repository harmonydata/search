12:Tf17,The Survey of Diet Among Children in Scotland, 2010 survey continued the work of the Survey of Sugar Intake among Children in Scotland, 2006 (held at the Archive under SN 6250), to monitor progress towards the Scottish Dietary Target for sugar intake in children. The 2010 survey also aimed to investigate the purchasing behaviours of children around the school day using a newly designed Food Purchasing Module (FPM). The survey was carried out by the University of Aberdeen, ScotCen Social Research, and the University of Hertfordshire.

Dietary targets for the Scottish population were published in 1996 as part of the Scottish Diet Action Plan. The targets were based on the UK Dietary Reference Values for selected nutrients and on patterns of food consumption in Scotland which were derived from National Food Survey data from 1989-1991. The 2006 survey aimed to monitor progress towards the Scottish Dietary Target for sugar intake in children, and the 2010 survey continued this work. The main aim of the 2010 survey was to estimate the intake of non-milk extrinsic sugars (NMES), total fat and saturated fatty acids and other nutrients and foods and drinks in a nationally representative sample of children aged 3-16 years living in Scotland in 2010. Additional aims were to:estimate the intake of NMES and other macronutrients and micronutrients in all children and in sub-groups divided by age, sex, deprivation category and urban/rural residence;estimate the prevalence of overweight and obesity in all children and in subgroups divided by age, sex, deprivation category and urban/rural residence;investigate associations between selected nutrients and foods and overweight and obesity in all children;determine the levels of physical activity and inactivity in all children and in subgroups divided by age, sex, deprivation category and urban/rural residence;investigate associations between physical activity and inactivity and overweight and obesity in all children and in sub-groups divided by age and sex;compare intakes of nutrients and foods, the prevalence of overweight and obesity, and levels of physical activity and inactivity with data from the 2006 survey. For further information, see the documentation, and the Food Standards Agency Survey of Diet among Children in Scotland webpage.

 The face-to-face interview was conducted using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) and used some modules which are currently used for the Scottish Health Survey (SHeS) (held at the Archive under GN 33320). Information was collected from the child's parent or guardian on household composition and the household reference person (HRP), the main food provider (MFP), and the child's physical activity. Height, weight and waist measurements of the child were also taken. Data were also collected on the child's food purchasing behaviour using a newly developed Food Purchasing Module (FPM).  The FPM included CAPI questions and a self-completion questionnaire. The FPM was newly designed for the 2010 survey to assess the food and drink purchasing habits of school children outside of school on school days.

in addition, the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) collected information on the child's diet over the past 2-3 months, and foods usually eaten. There were two versions of the FFQ: one for children aged 3-11 years and the other for children aged 12-16 years. A parent or guardian was asked to complete the FFQ and the interview on behalf of younger group with help from the child where appropriate. The older group were asked to complete the FFQ and the questions in the interview relating to physical activity and food purchasing behaviour with help from a parent or guardian as necessary. Nutrient intakes were subsequently calculated from the FFQs using an in-house calculation programme, developed by the University of Aberdeen.13:Tf17,The Survey of Diet Among Children in Scotland, 2010 survey continued the work of the Survey of Sugar Intake among Children in Scotland, 2006 (held at the Archive under SN 6250), to monitor progress towards the Scottish Dietary Target for sugar intake in children.
