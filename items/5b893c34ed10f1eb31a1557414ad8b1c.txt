12:Tc9f,This research focuses on the global biomedical economy. At present this field is characterised by multiple interests, markets and country partners brought together by novel and diverging knowledge relations in the pursuit of new drugs, therapies and health interventions. Within the various communities that make up this field, the idea of collaboration has emerged as the prominent paradigm for social translation between knowledge partners. Yet, as research is increasingly undertaken across continents, the role of science, technology and bioethics in the creation and transfer of new knowledge – including forms of ‘biowealth’ – has been typically framed by first-world policy makers and in terms of notions of ‘development’. 

Focusing on 8 countries in Asia, comparative research was carried out by a team of social anthropologists (Universities of Cambridge, Durham, Sussex). The team used ethnographic methods to study ‘collaborative’ practices in international capacity-building. Three closely related subprojects provided the foundation for the research: (i) sponsor-host relations in international clinical trials; (ii) human embryonic stem cell research in society, and (iii) collaborative bioethics networking.  The research reveals how commercial and academic research institutions are underpinned by cultural understandings and ethical values.  These are expressed through formal and informal regulatory practices and through state and non-governmental organisations. The research sheds light on what happens when discourses of development are reframed or replaced by those of collaboration and new kinds of socio-economic demands emerge in the management of science across cultures.

These sub-projects aim to contribute a culturally reflexive understanding of the drivers of commercial and academic research institutions and forms of regulation by state and non-governmental organisations.
