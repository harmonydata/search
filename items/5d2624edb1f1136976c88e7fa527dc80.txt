12:T41e,WDDS was a project specific dataset for specific COVID-19 related projects only, which is not currently available to request. Prescription data are available from the WLGP dataset.

The data covers prescriptions that are prescribed in Wales by GPs (general medical practitioners) and non medical prescribers that have prescribed on behalf of the GP practice, that are then dispensed in the community within Wales. This is in contrast to prescription data which are contained in the WLGP dataset, which may not be dispensed.

The data includes all prescribed medicines, dressings and appliances that are dispensed each month. If a patient does not take a prescription to the pharmacy for dispensing, then the information will not be included in the dataset. Information includes - the number of prescription items dispensed by each community pharmacy in Wales, broken down by the GP practice in which they prescribed, and also the number of prescription items prescribed in each GP practice in Wales broken down by the pharmacy that dispensed those items.13:T41e,WDDS was a project specific dataset for specific COVID-19 related projects only, which is not currently available to request.
