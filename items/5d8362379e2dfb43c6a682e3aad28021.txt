12:T707,The overall objective of this study was to estimate the effect of urban regeneration upon the association between social exclusion and various health outcomes.

Access was available to health survey data collected for Primary Care Trusts in 2006, covering ten Local Authority (LA) areas in the North West of England. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to identify clusters of varying social exclusion within over 20,000 survey respondents. Six individual-level socio-economic and social capital variables from the health surveys were included in the LCA, along with five area-based measures (i.e. characteristics of the lower Super Output Area (SOA) that the respondent resided in, such as percentage of population with no educational qualifications). Four social exclusion clusters (classes) were identified from the LCA.

For all respondents in the dataset an attempt was made to determine, from their postcode and period of residence, if they had been included in any regeneration target populations from 1995 onwards. If so, the period of exposure to regeneration and the intensity (funding level) of regeneration exposure were estimated for each respondent. To develop these measures, it was first necessary to obtain details of 32 mainstream regeneration programmes that had taken place within the ten LAs between 1995 and 2006. The geographical target area for each programme was identified, and it was established whether or not an individual survey respondent would have been residing in one or more programme areas during their period of implementation.

 The main analysis concerned investigating associations between the computed regeneration measures, the derived social exclusion classes and the different health outcomes.13:T707,The overall objective of this study was to estimate the effect of urban regeneration upon the association between social exclusion and various health outcomes.
