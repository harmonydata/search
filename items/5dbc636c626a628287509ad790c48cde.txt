12:T546,The Wellcome Global Monitor is the first global survey of how people worldwide think and feel about key science and health challenges - including such critical topics as public trust in scientists, attitudes towards vaccines and how inclusive or exclusive people believe the benefits of science to be.The survey involved more than 140,000 people in 144 countries in 2018, and was run as part of the Gallup World Poll.  Typically, 1,000 individuals were surveyed in each country. In China, India and Russia the sample sizes were 2,000 or greater. In rare instances, the sample size fell between 500 and 1,000.The survey will provide evidence on how 
public attitudes vary across different demographic groups and countries, and will help researchers and 
policy makers around the world to promote debate, and frame proposals 
for action to improve engagement and trust in science and healthcare.Further information about the survey can be found on the Wellcome Global Monitor website.For the second edition (July 2019), updated versions of the data and documentation are provided. The survey included the following variables:responses from Wellcome Global Monitor 2018 questionnairegender and ageeducational level, employment status and per capita income quintilescountry income level (World Bank)urban/rural locationWellcome Trust in Scientists Index13:T546,The Wellcome Global Monitor is the first global survey of how people worldwide think and feel about key science and health challenges - including such critical topics as public trust in scientists, attitudes towards vaccines and how inclusive or exclusive people believe the benefits of science to be.The survey involved more than 140,000 people in 144 countries in 2018, and was run as part of the Gallup World Poll.  Typically, 1,000 individuals were surveyed in each country.
