•	What is the nature of ethnic minority experience in these organisations and how have issues of equality and diversity been addressed in institutional policies and content production? 
•	What is meant by ‘representation’ in cultural institutions and cultural production? 
•	How do institutions attract and engage with ethnic minority audiences?
The deposited data includes interviews with those working in factual TV production, mostly within an anonymised independent tv company in the North West of the UK, but some from wider sourcesUnderstandings of ethnic inequalities in the UK have developed substantially as a result of the work of The Centre on Dynamics of Ethnicity (CoDE). CoDE has successfully carried out an innovative programme of research, pursued challenging scientific objectives, and worked closely with a range of non-academic partners to impact on policy debates and development.

In a rapidly evolving political and policy context, we propose a further, ambitious programme of work that takes us in new directions with a distinct focus. We will move beyond nuanced description to understanding processes and causes of ethnic inequalities, and build directly on our established experience in interdisciplinary and mixed methods working. In addition, we will use a co-production approach, working with a range of partners, including key public institutions such as the BBC, universities, political parties, ethnic minority NGOs, activists, and individuals, in order to frame and carry out our research in ways that will maximise our societal impact and lead to meaningful change. Our overarching objectives are to:
-Understand how ethnic inequalities develop in a range of interconnected domains
-Examine how these processes relate to and are shaped by other social categories, such as gender, class, religion and generation
-Understand how ethnic inequalities take shape, and are embedded, in institutional spaces and practices
-Work closely with policy and practice partners to meaningfully address enduring ethnic inequalities
-Pursue methodological developments with interdisciplinary mixed methods and co-production at their core
-Achieve ongoing high quality international academic impact

Through a research plan divided into four work packages, we will examine ethnic inequalities in (1) higher education, (2) cultural production and consumption, (3) politics, representation and political parties and (4) pursue policy and institutional impact with our work in these areas. Alongside this, we are also conducting a programme of work on severe mental illness. These work packages will be organised around our ambition to understand, explain and impact on ethnic inequalities through a focus on institutional production of and responses to ethnic inequalities.

At the core of our methodological approach is interdisciplinary and mixed methods working. Our quantitative work will be predominantly secondary data analysis, making the best use of the wide range of resources in the UK (e.g. Understanding Society, Destination of Leavers of Higher Education Survey, British Election Study, ONS Longitudinal Studies). Our qualitative work will be based around ethnographic approaches that are attentive to the ways in which social processes play out differently in different sites and institutions. We are informed especially by the approach of institutional ethnography which prioritises an attention to the lived, everyday experience of inequality, but aims to clarify the wider social relations in which such experiences are embedded and by which they are shaped. Thus institutional ethnographies will be developed which begin with exploring the experience of those directly involved in institutional settings as a route to understanding how structures and practices of institutions shape individuals&#x27; experiences and practices.

Throughout our work we will integrate and mobilise research evidence to engage with a full range of partners in order to influence policy and practice development, public understanding and institutional practice. As well as having academic impact (journal articles, conferences, seminars, newsletters), our findings will be communicated directly to policy and advocacy organisations through a combination of well developed (blogs, Twitter, policy briefings) and emerging (podcasts and live streaming, museum and art exhibitions, online portal for individual narratives) forms of dissemination, and we will work directly with these organisations to achieve change."/><meta property="og:title" content="Ethnic Inequalities in Cultural Production, 2018-2020"/><meta property="og:description" content="Examining institutions in the cultural sector (particularly in the TV industry), this project sought to ask the following questions:

Our overarching objectives are to:\n-Understand how ethnic inequalities develop in a range of interconnected domains\n-Examine how these processes relate to and are shaped by other social categories, such as gender, class, religion and generation\n-Understand how ethnic inequalities take shape, and are embedded, in institutional spaces and practices\n-Work closely with policy and practice partners to meaningfully address enduring ethnic inequalities\n-Pursue methodological developments with interdisciplinary mixed methods and co-production at their core\n-Achieve ongoing high quality international academic impact\n\nThrough a research plan divided into four work packages, we will examine ethnic inequalities in (1) higher education, (2) cultural production and consumption, (3) politics, representation and political parties and (4) pursue policy and institutional impact with our work in these areas.

Our qualitative work will be based around ethnographic approaches that are attentive to the ways in which social processes play out differently in different sites and institutions. We are informed especially by the approach of institutional ethnography which prioritises an attention to the lived, everyday experience of inequality, but aims to clarify the wider social relations in which such experiences are embedded and by which they are shaped. Thus institutional ethnographies will be developed which begin with exploring the experience of those directly involved in institutional settings as a route to understanding how structures and practices of institutions shape individuals' experiences and practices.\n\nThroughout our work we will integrate and mobilise research evidence to engage with a full range of partners in order to influence policy and practice development, public understanding and institutional practice. As well as having academic impact (journal articles, conferences, seminars, newsletters), our findings will be communicated directly to policy and advocacy organisations through a combination of well developed (blogs, Twitter, policy briefings) and emerging (podcasts and live streaming, museum and art exhibitions, online portal for individual narratives) forms of dissemination, and we will work directly with these organisations to achieve change."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"13:T1236,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Examining institutions in the cultural sector (particularly in the TV industry), this project sought to ask the following questions:\n•\tWhat is the nature of ethnic minority experience in these organisations and how have issues of equality and diversity been addressed in institutional policies and content production? \n•\tWhat is meant by ‘representation’ in cultural institutions and cultural production? \n•\tHow do institutions attract and engage with ethnic minority audiences?\nThe deposited data includes interviews with those working in factual TV production, mostly within an anonymised independent tv company in the North West of the UK, but some from wider sourcesUnderstandings of ethnic inequalities in the UK have developed substantially as a result of the work of The Centre on Dynamics of Ethnicity (CoDE).
