12:Tb25,The aim is to identify and describe how employers are restructuring work and human resource practices under conditions of persistent environmental turbulence.  This climate of change in the workplace has been interpreted as the response of employers to  environmental changes in  competition, technology and regulation.  In the 1980s and much of the 1990s, the dominant  external pressure was the rapid increase in international trade and finance, and hence in competition.  Salient responses by employers included rationalization, downsizing, de-layering and methods of work intensification and labour cost reduction.  It is now widely  perceived that this phase has been progressively replaced, since about 1995, by one in which  the dominant external pressures (and opportunities) come from new technology (ICT).  The scope for business innovation is widening in the wake of the Internet and e-commerce, and organisations are searching for the creative and technical talent, which will permit them to  make the shift from cost-competition to knowledge-competition.  
The regulatory environment has also changed over this period.  In the 1980s and early 1990s, the British Government favoured deregulation (or where regulation was increased, as in the case of trade unions, this  was to the advantage of employers); and there was strong opposition to the efforts of  supranational authorities to regulate the workplace and the employment relationship.  In the latter part of the 1990s, however, new regulation of these areas again became prominent, with the national minimum wage and the working time directive being the best-known but by no means the only examples.   The re-emergence of regulation reflects the desire of European governments to maintain  control of social and employment policy in the face of global competitive pressures and the  growth of global businesses.  The sample includes establishments with 5 or more employees.   Six areas of employer policy  have been identified that are likely to shape the workplaces of the future.   The six areas of policy that have been chosen to investigate are: organisational and workforce restructuring, reshaping of physical workplaces, the monitoring, reward and control of  employees, patterns of communication, working time and family-friendly practices.  The  research has also been designed to throw light on an overarching theme that unites many of  these policy areas: flexibility.

  The basic descriptors of establishment characteristic: size and composition  of workforce, sector; policy on deployment of personnel; use of temporary  staff; recruitment issues; working practices; recent changes in working  practices and plans for the future; working conditions for the staff at  the establishment; use of appraisals; use of information technology; legal  and regulatory environment.13:Tb25,The aim is to identify and describe how employers are restructuring work and human resource practices under conditions of persistent environmental turbulence.
