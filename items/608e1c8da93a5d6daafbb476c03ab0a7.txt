12:T78d,This dataset contains quantitative survey data from a theory-based longitudinal schools study, with the purpose of examining predictors of self-harm among adolescents in Scotland with and without bereavement experiences. Data from columns with potentially identifying information have been redacted in order to preserve anonymity of participants. This includes details on dates and times of data collection, school details, participant codes, as well as free-text responses which may include identifying information. Further information on variable names and descriptions from which data have been redacted are provided at the end of the accompanying README file.The aim of this study was to examine cross-sectional and prospective predictors of self-harm in a sample of adolescents from secondary schools across Scotland. Of particular interest was the association between bereavement (by suicide and other causes of death) and self-harm, as previous research suggests that exposure to the suicide of others may increase vulnerability for self-harm or suicide. 
A total of 185 adolescents (aged 11-17) were recruited at baseline from Scottish secondary schools, and 115 individuals took part at follow-up, approximately six months later. Participants were asked to complete an anonymous self-report questionnaire consisting of several theory-based measures which have been used, or deemed appropriate for use, with adolescents. This included measures of: depression, anxiety, defeat, entrapment, social support, self-esteem, coping, attitudes toward suicide, bereavement, grief reactions, life events (including exposure to bereavement by suicide and other causes of death), and self-harm. 
Further details as well as findings regarding rates of self-harm and bereavement, and associations between variables at baseline and follow-up, are reported in the following peer-reviewed publication: https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.0115313:T78d,This dataset contains quantitative survey data from a theory-based longitudinal schools study, with the purpose of examining predictors of self-harm among adolescents in Scotland with and without bereavement experiences.
