12:Te28,Following changes in the provision of welfare, school milk and school meals in 1971, studies were set up to assess the possible effects of these changes upon the nutritional state of the population. The aim of the National Study of Health and Growth (NSHG) was to set up an anthropometric system of surveillance on selected growth, nutritional and health characteristics that could identify the effects of the changes in food policy. Height was chosen as the main indicator of nutritional status together with weight and triceps skinfold thickness. The primary aim of the study was to estimate trends in anthropometric measurements for children of the same age. Although changes in rate of growth at a given age may occur over time, the main question to be answered was whether there had been any overall shift in the position of the growth curve.
 The aim of the third phase of the study (phase III) was to continue with the collection of basic information for monitoring the nutritional status and growth of primary school children, with the additional information for associated studies, as in phase II. By 1982, however, it was apparent that the sample did not achieve the weighting towards poorer children originally intended. In addition, it under-represented inner urban areas and the Scottish sample was too small for separate age/sex group analysis. In order to include a sample from inner city areas and ethnic minorities, and increase the Scottish sample, but at the same time maintain the longitudinal element from the first two phases of the study, a second sample was recruited. A two-year cycle was introduced, with the existing areas being surveyed every even year and a new inner city/enhanced Scottish sample being surveyed every odd year.
From 1992 onwards (phase IIIb), in addition to the basic monitoring of health and growth, the study aimed to explore more details of children's food intake, and the level of fitness of the older children in the study.
For further details, please see Appendix 3 of the User Guide for this study.  For all 13 years of the study, measurements of height, weight, triceps skinfold thickness and ethnic origin were taken for all children. Information on birth weight, length of gestation, past history of respiratory illnesses, number of siblings, current consumption of school milk and meals and other milk (as supplied by the mother or guardian) are recorded for most children. Details of household composition, social class, education and employment of parents/guardians, height of natural parents and receipt of benefits are recorded where available.
From 1987 onwards, details of parental/guardian smoking habits are included.
From 1992 onwards, the data include details on frequency of food intake and supplements.
Additional information on cooking fuels, food sensitivity and intolerance, parental atopy, medication for chest illness, enuresis, amount of time child sleeps, infant feeding, and family history of heart attacks, are included for some years.
Lung function results are included for older children between 1987 and 1990 in selected areas. Grip strength is recorded from 1985 to 1988, and subscapular skinfold thickness from 1989. Language spoken at home was recorded in the inner city sample years.
From 1992 onwards additional anthropometric measurements and data on fitness (lung function, blood pressure, heart rate, serum cholesterol) is recorded for rising nines. Clinical chemistry and haematology results are available for rising nines in 1994.
