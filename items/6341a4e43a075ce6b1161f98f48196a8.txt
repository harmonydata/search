12:Te78,Following changes in the provision of welfare, school milk and school meals in 1971, studies were set up to assess the possible effects of these changes upon the nutritional state of the population. The aim of the National Study of Health and Growth (NSHG) was to set up an anthropometric system of surveillance on selected growth, nutritional and health characteristics that could identify the effects of the changes in food policy. Height was chosen as the main indicator of nutritional status together with weight and triceps skinfold thickness. The primary aim of the study was to estimate trends in anthropometric measurements for children of the same age. Although changes in rate of growth at a given age may occur over time, the main question to be answered was whether there had been any overall shift in the position of the growth curve.
 The aim of the first five-year study (subsequently referred to as phase I) was to set up the planned anthropometric system of surveillance. It was originally intended to determine the extent and nature of poor nutrition (both over and under nutrition), to identify selected regional, demographic and socio-economic factors associated with childrens' growth, and to investigate the relationships between weight, height and the consumption of milk and school meals.  The new entrants data sets include initial recording and measurements of age, gender, height, weight, triceps skinfold thickness, ethnic origin, school milk consumption and number of siblings for all children. Information on birthweight, past history of respiratory illnesses and hospitalisations, number of siblings and current consumption of school milk and meals and other milk and dairy produce (as supplied by the mother or guardian), is recorded for most new entrant children. Details on household composition, height, weight, birthplace, education and employment of parents/guardians, family income and nutritional knowledge are recorded for each family where available.
The subsequent follow-up datasets include data from the yearly follow-ups of the children originally identified in the new entrant data. This includes yearly measurements of height, weight, triceps skinfold thickness, peak expiratory flow and consumption of school milk for each child. Information on consumption of school milk and meals and other milk and dairy produce, health, development and hospitalisations in the past year (as supplied by the parents/guardians) are recorded for each follow-up for each child. Details of family income, family size, employment, domestic accommodation heating and cooking arrangements are recorded for each family unit at each follow-up where available.

Standard Measures
Height was measured on a specially designed Holtain stadiometer to the last complete 0.5cm as recorded by Tanner et al (1966 - see reference below).
Triceps skinfold measurements were taken as recommended by Tanner and Whitehouse (1962 - see reference below) except that the midpoint between the tip of the acromion and olecranon was marked with the arm hanging straight instead of bent. For details see 'Fieldworkers Manual' in Appendix 3 of the User Guide.
Respiratory questions were adapted from the MRC questionnaire on chronic bronchitis.
