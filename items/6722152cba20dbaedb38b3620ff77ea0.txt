12:T6ac,This 4-year project aims to answer fundamental and applied questions concerning the nature and effects of emotion regulation. Emotion regulation describes the mental and behavioural processes by which people influence their own and other people's feelings. These processes can have a major bearing on people's well-being, performance, and relationships across many settings. Dysfunctional emotion regulation also plays a role in various mental health and societal problems, such as bipolar disorder and interpersonal conflict. The research is a collaborative venture between investigators from seven psychological disciplines based at the Universities of Sheffield (Work Psychology, Neuroscience, Health Psychology), Oxford (Social Psychology), Manchester (Clinical Psychology), Reading (Developmental Psychology), and Wolverhampton (Sports Psychology).Projects within the research are investigating:

how emotion regulation develops in infancy and varies in adulthood
which neural systems are involved when people regulate their own and others' emotions
whether emotions can be regulated automatically (without awareness)
the consequences of people regulating their own emotions
the consequences of people regulating each others' emotions
whether cognitive-behavioural interventions can facilitate 'healthy' emotion regulation.

The studies involve a wide range of participants and methods, including fMRI neuroimaging, experiments, time-sampling, field studies, surveys, case studies, and interventions.
