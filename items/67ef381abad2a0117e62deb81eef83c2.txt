12:T712,There is a high average economic benefit from staying on in education and particularly going to university. Yet a high proportion of people leave full-time education at a young age. One reason for this may be a lack of adequate information about the consequences of educational decisions at an appropriate time.

The objective of this research was to test whether provision of information on the economic costs and benefits of educational decisions affects the knowledge, expectations and choices of students when they are at school. This was tested by an 'information campaign' that was implemented in a random sample of schools in London. All Year 10 students in 54 participating schools were surveyed on two occasions (8-12 weeks apart). In half of these schools, an 'information campaign' was delivered between the two surveys. 

The main findings of the research include the conclusion that the 'information campaign' significantly improved knowledge in treatment schools relative to the comparison group. To some extent this led to an improved perception of the benefits and affordability of staying on in education. However, it did not affect subject choice at A-level or intentions to go to university. Over the period of the study, the government announced a three-fold increase to university tuition fees. The project analysis suggested a reaction to this, depending on when the surveys took place in relation to media reports. This research demonstrates both the usefulness and limitations of 'information campaigns' and the influence of the media.
