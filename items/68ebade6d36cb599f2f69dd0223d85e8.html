This was a baseline study followed by repeat surveys in 2000, 2001 and 2002. The NALS series is used by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) to monitor the effectiveness of their adult learning policies and progress in meeting the National Learning Target for adult participation, which aims to reduce the proportion of non-learners found in 1997 by seven per cent, that is, to reduce this group from 26 to 24 per cent by 2002.  The survey involves interviewing up to two adults in a household to ask about any learning they have been involved in over the previous three years. A fairly broad definition of learning is used, covering informal and leisure learning as well as courses leading to qualifications. Both taught and self-directed learning are covered by the survey.
