12:T5cd,Data collection investigating whether online civic ‘self-help’ sites provide an entryway into civic and political engagement. Data were gathered on usage of the sites, levels of political and community involvement, political trust, interpersonal trust, political efficacy, perceptions of influence and competence.
The programme of data collection included a two-wave online panel survey, online focus groups and weekly online time diaries collected over a period of 12 weeks. Participants were users of the websites developed by mySociety, who were recruited using banners posted on the websites and emails sent to registered users.

This project will investigate whether the online environment and civic sector organisations like mySociety are providing a new pathways to democratic participation for individuals who are typically less socially and politically engaged. Through mySociety sites people can contact local authorities and raise specific concerns about local roads and transport.

A key question we investigate here is whether this type of practical engagement leads to wider involvement in the community and politics? We do so using a combination of survey analysis of site users, focus group interviews and time diaries.

The findings will give a unique insight for both academics and practitioners into the value of these online community portals as channels for integrating less well-served communities and individuals into broader social and political structures.13:T5cd,Data collection investigating whether online civic ‘self-help’ sites provide an entryway into civic and political engagement.
