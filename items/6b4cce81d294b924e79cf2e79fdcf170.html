The Egypt Labour Market Panel Survey 2012 (ELMPS 12) is a follow-up survey to the Egypt Labour Market Surveys of 2006 &amp; 1998 (ELMPS06 &amp; ELMS 98), which were carried out by the Economic Research Forum in cooperation with the Egyptian Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS).  The ELMPS 12 is the third round of a periodic longitudinal survey that tracks the labour market characteristics of the households and the individuals interviewed in 1998 and 2006, any new households that might have split from them, as well as a refresher sample to ensure that the data continue to be nationally-representative. Our project funded by the ESRC-DFID allowed the addition of  a refresher sample of 2,000 households to the ELMPS 12, to over-sample high migration areas to allow more detailed measures of migration trends, determinants, consequences and return migration in Egypt. In addition, we were able to include a new revised extended module on return migration and additional questions on current migrants. 
The data on current and return migration where driven by our objective to enlarge the evidence base of the triple-win policy vision of temporary migration, by focusing on the return migrants and considering the extent to which, and the leading dimensions along which, the returnee can impact positively on the source country, and in turn how the sending country can maximise its benefits from temporary migration by supporting the returnee. This dynamic relationship in turn informs the incentives of migrants to stay temporarily rather than permanently in the host country, and to become directly a driver or contributor to economic development in the source country. Hence, resulting in a win-win-win situation for migrants, sending countries and receiving countries."/><meta property="og:title" content="Egypt labor market panel survey 2012"/><meta property="og:description" content="The ELMPS is a nationally representative panel survey, collected by the Economic Research Forum and CAPMAS in Egypt, that covers topics such as parental background, education, housing, access to services, residential mobility, time use, marriage patterns and costs, fertility, women’s decision making and empowerment, job dynamics, savings and borrowing behavior, the operation of household enterprises and farms, besides the usual focus on employment, unemployment and earnings in typical labor force surveys.
