12:T6de,This is a qualitative data collection. The study was designed to build on the findings of previous Food Standards Agency (FSA) work and specifically aimed to:explore why people hold particular views to GM food  better understand how people's attitudes to genetically modified (GM) food are formedexplore how people weigh up the risks and benefits associated with GM foodbetter understand what causes people to be indifferent to GM foodexplore the circumstances in which people change their viewsThese objectives were met using a three-stage research design. Firstly, in-depth interviews were held with 30 respondents to the British Social Attitudes, 2008* (BSA) survey, in two geographical areas, to explore what shapes attitudes to GM food. Secondly, two deliberative workshops were held with the interviewed respondents to further understand attitude shaping and explore the impact of receiving information about GM food. Finally, six follow-up telephone interviews explored participants' experience of the research process. Purposive sampling ensured diversity in attitudes to GM food as expressed in the BSA survey, in relation to relevant socio-demographic factors.

Further information about the research, including links to reports, may be found on the NatCen Public Attitudes to GM Foods and FSA Public Attitudes to GM Foods project web pages.

*The British Social Attitudes Survey, 2008 is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 6390.

 The interviews covered background and personal circumstances; attitudes and behaviour in relation to food in general; awareness of and views about food production; knowledge, awareness and understanding of GM foods; attitudes towards GM foods; what kind of further information on GM interviewees would find useful.13:T6de,This is a qualitative data collection.
