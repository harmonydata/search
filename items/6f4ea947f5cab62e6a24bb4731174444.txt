12:T602,The survey of a sample of 300 households in the (old) Port Talbot local authority area was intended to provide a context for field research into the <i>Social consequences of high unemployment</i> (G00230048): an investigation of the response to large-scale redundancy and high levels of unemployment in the settlement most affected by the redundancies in West Industrial South Wales (Port Talbot), focusing on the extent, structure and nature of traffic along local social networks within the locality and the response of local voluntary organisations  Variables
