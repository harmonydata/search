12:T9aa,These data were generated in two mangrove socio-ecological systems in the north and south of the Red River Delta with different environmental and socio-economic histories. The research included: a) questionnaires (n=300) with households at each site to quantify household economy and adaptive capacity information and explore spatially explicit perceptions about mangrove ecosystem services; b) in-depth livelihood trajectory interviews (n=20) with households representing different adaptive capacity profiles; c) focus group discussions (n=6) to explore plausible future scenarios that impact the mangrove system with households representing different adaptive capacity profiles; and d) in-depth interviews (n=18) with key informants from relevant Ministries, local government departments and civic groups. Datasets can be used as stand-alone, yet richer analysis can be done linking the various sources of information.Mangroves provide multiple benefits from carbon storage and shoreline protection at global and national scales, to food and energy for natural resource-dependent coastal communities at local scale. However, mangroves are coming under increasing pressure due to land use changes resulting from climate change, coastal development and aquaculture. In Vietnam the area under mangrove forest declined by 35% between 1983 and 2012, increasing vulnerability of the coast to tidal surges, hurricanes and saline intrusion as well as reducing the availability and accessibility of mangrove resources necessary to support livelihoods. Previous research in Vietnam has taken a largely technical approach to the relationship between mangrove protection, restoration and aquaculture and has not paid adequate attention to socio-economic factors. This research aims to evaluate socio-ecological resilience in Vietnamese mangroves in the Red River Delta and evaluate management options to enhance delivery of benefits and services across multiple scales, using an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates ecology; remote sensing and GIS; and social research methods on livelihoods and scenario evaluation. By doing so, this research will contribute to a) the livelihoods and resilience of mangrove dependent communities, b) the on-going delivery of ecosystem services across scales, while at the same time c) through stakeholder engagement and knowledge exchange throughout, building the capacity for conservation and sustainable management of mangroves in Vietnam.13:T9aa,These data were generated in two mangrove socio-ecological systems in the north and south of the Red River Delta with different environmental and socio-economic histories.
