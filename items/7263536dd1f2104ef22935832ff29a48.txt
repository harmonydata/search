12:Ta2d,In brief, these files contain data on the amplitude of motor evoked potential responses evoked through transcranial magnetic stimulation of primary motor cortex during the observation of simple finger movements. In Experiment 1 participants were tested on one occasion and responses were measured at five timepoints after observed movement onset. In Experiment 2 participants were tested before and after sensorimotor training, and responses were measured at three timepoints after observed movement onset.

In Experiment 1 fourteen participants were tested and the experimental data are from twenty within-participants experimental variables as follows:
Muscle (FDI, ADM) x Action observed (index finger movement, little finger movement) x Timepoint (100, 150, 200, 250, 300 ms after observed movement onset)

In Experiment 2 eighteen participants were tested and the experimental data are from twenty-four within-participants experimental variables as follows:
Session (pre-training, post-training) x Muscle (FDI, ADM) x Action observed (index finger movement, little finger movement) x Timepoint (200, 250, 300 ms after observed movement onset)

This is supporting data for a journal article, data collection description including a full methodological details are given in the research paper (see Related Resources). 
People copy each other all the time, often without realising it. This behaviour - imitation - is important for social interaction and learning new skills, but it can also have undesirable effects, for example copying antisocial behaviour.

Imitation is thought to rely on 'mirror' neurons, which are cells in the brain that are active when we perform an action and also when we see someone else perform the same action. This research project investigates both imitation behaviour and the responses of mirror neuron areas in the brain, using behavioural and neuroscientific methods (functional magnetic resonance imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation). The project has two aims: the first is to understand how we acquire the ability to imitate other people, while the second is to investigate how the brain controls imitative behaviour, and how the ability to control imitation is affected by context - for example, when people feel part of a social group.

The outcomes of the research could help design training methods for people who have trouble imitating (such as people with autism), or to improve imitation learning of skills, sports, or dance. It also has implications for understanding - and perhaps for influencing - people's imitative behaviour in group situations.13:Ta2d,In brief, these files contain data on the amplitude of motor evoked potential responses evoked through transcranial magnetic stimulation of primary motor cortex during the observation of simple finger movements.
