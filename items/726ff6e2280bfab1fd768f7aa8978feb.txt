12:T812,Interviews with scientists and engineers, as well as with end-users, relating to the development of a handheld Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives (CBRNE) detector. We followed the patterns of communication, interaction and negotiation between engineers, end-users and others. This enabled the development of a deep understanding of how security technologies are developed. We produced new cross-disciplinary knowledge through engagement between social scientists and engineers, and developed new insights in the intersections of politics, sociology, and Science and Technology Studies. This research maps and analyses how new security technologies are developed in practice through inter-disciplinary collaborative research between social scientists and engineers. It will contribute to cross-disciplinary and applied knowledge about the drivers and challenges of science and technology in relation to defence and security needs. It studies the HANDHOLD project (an integrated portable Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive detection device) that involves nine partners including engineering companies, academics, and end-users from five EU countries.
This project explores how these different contexts affect the management of risk and uncertainty in the development of security technologies. It examines how different understandings of risk and security interact in processes of technology development, how risks and uncertainties are negotiated and managed, and how the risk of failure and the security context shape the complex creative enterprise of technology development. The methods employed include analysis of key documents; observation of scientists and engineers in action, and interviews with key participants in different agencies.

The research will produce a number of reports and workshops for government and other stakeholders as well as high quality academic publications. It will offer important lessons for technology development, implementation, and policy making, as well as for academic knowledge.13:T812,Interviews with scientists and engineers, as well as with end-users, relating to the development of a handheld Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives (CBRNE) detector.
