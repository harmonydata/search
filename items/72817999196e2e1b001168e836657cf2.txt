12:T1288,This study was conducted as a part of MS's PhD project investigating the experience of romantic relationships and sexuality education in neurodivergent and neurotypical young people from the perspectives of young people, educational professionals, and caregivers.

This study aimed to contribute to the existing limited knowledge on sexuality education and experiences of romantic relationships in neurodivergent young people (autistic, with ADHD, and with ASD co-occurring with ADHD [to the best of the researcher’s knowledge, no research has yet to explore the topic in the group with a dual diagnosis]). The outcomes of this study contribute to a greater understanding of what type of sexuality education young people (neurodivergent and neurotypical) receive in their schools/colleges and from their parents, as well as what suggestions they offer for the improvement of sexuality education (to make it more beneficial for young people).
This knowledge may help contribute to the design of adequate and inclusive sexuality and romantic relationship education for all young people including the neurodivergent groups, which would be in line with young people's voices on the topic. Appropriate sexuality education for young people may subsequently positively influence their skills in navigating romantic relationships. This may be especially beneficial for the neurodivergent groups of young people since as this research highlighted, they tend to experience greater challenges navigating the complicated world of romance and intimacy than their neurotypical peers. The outcome of this research may also help promote a greater general quality of life in the neurodivergent groups of young people.

The key findings of this study: Six themes were developed from the participants’ narratives: Societal ideology about sexuality; Substandard school-based sexuality education; The role of adults in sexuality education; Pornography, as a very powerful alternative means of sexuality education; Young people and romance - a complicated world to navigate; Experience of abuse in the young neurodivergent population is a serious matter.
The findings revealed that many young people (neurodivergent and neurotypical) received basic sex education in their schools/colleges and homes and encountered challenges navigating romantic relationships. Neurodivergent young people reported experiencing greater challenges related to their understanding of and building romantic relationships than their neurotypical peers.Abstract
Purpose – The literature indicates that sexuality education provided in schools/colleges in the United Kingdom (UK) may not be appropriate for people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). There appears to be a lack of understanding of the subject regarding young people with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and a dual diagnosis (ASD co-occurring with ADHD). Research also suggests that compared to neurotypical (NT) peers, young people with ASD tend to receive less support on sexuality from their parents, who often feel that they lack the appropriate skills to help their children with some sex-related issues. Some young people with ASD and ADHD also report lacking an understanding of the social nuances of dating and intimacy, which is crucial for navigating romantic relationships. 
Design/methodology/approach – This study explored sexuality education and romantic relationships in young people based on a semi-structured interview approach to the topic. Thematic Analysis (TA) was employed to analyze the data. 
Findings –Six themes were developed from the participants’ narratives: Societal ideology about sexuality; Substandard school-based sexuality education; The role of adults in sexuality education; Pornography, as a very powerful alternative means of sexuality education; Young people and romance - a complicated world to navigate; Experience of abuse in the young neurodivergent population is a serious matter.
 Findings revealed that many young people (ND and NT) received basic sex education in their schools/colleges and homes and encountered challenges navigating romantic relationships. ND young people reported experiencing greater challenges related to their understanding of and building romantic relationships than their NT peers. 
Originality/value – To the researchers’ knowledge, this is the first exploration of romantic relationships and sexuality education in NT young people as well as three groups of ND young people (with ASD, ADHD, and ASD co-occurring with ADHD).
