12:T56d,The main object of this three part study was to identify social and psychological factors relating to the careers of highly qualified young men and women in Britain. It aimed to contribute to an understanding of the development process of occupational career aspirations in the two sexes. Designed as a simulated longitudinal study, the research was concerned with 3 important stages in the lives of these young people: at about the age of 18, when they are on the point of leaving the sixth form; on graduation from university; and at eight years after graduation, when most are about thirty.  Variables
The major aspects of this study involved an analysis of the interplay between reference groups, organisational contexts, and cultural norms in the formation of self-conceptions, personal norms and behaviour of men and women at University. Variables include sex and scholastic achievement, career orientations, class, a comparison of value systems at home and at school, parental activities, attitudes and relationships, religion, actual academic performace, career aspirations, expectations of satisfaction from career and perception of choice of most members of respondent's own sex. Students were asked to choose between putative scholastic achievement and outstanding personal popularity.
Early factors include social class, mother's work and attitude towards it, sibling position.13:T56d,The main object of this three part study was to identify social and psychological factors relating to the careers of highly qualified young men and women in Britain.
