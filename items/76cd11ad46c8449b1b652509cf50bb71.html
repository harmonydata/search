One of the key aims of the survey series is to examine continuity and change in attitudes to financial planning for retirement over time so a large number of the questions have been repeated over all three surveys.\n\n The Attitudes to Pensions Survey, 2012 is the third survey in the series. Although the survey retains key questions from the previous surveys in the series, the sample definition and questionnaire are two key areas of change in the 2012 survey. \n\nFor the 2012 survey, the upper age limit for participation in the survey of 69, in place in the two previous surveys, was removed so that anyone aged 18 or over was eligible to take part. This reflected the need to research issues around policies aimed at redefining retirement, encouraging more flexible working and extending working life. \n\nThe questionnaire was changed to reflect the changing policy environment in particular:inclusion of more attitudes to reflect automatic aspects of behaviourquestions included to reflect changing circumstance/policy interestless emphasis on some details (e.g. provision)a new section on automatic enrolment The interview covered: pensions knowledge (including knowledge of own State Pension Age), attitudes to pensions, attitudes to saving, pension provision, automatic enrolment in to workplace pensions, savings for retirement, debt, expectations for retirement, when expect to retire from paid work, reasons for age of retirement (if retired), expected or actual level of income in retirement and demographic information.e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Attitudes to Pensions Survey, 2012\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$12\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"Attitudes to Pensions Survey, 2012\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"conte"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"nt\":\"$13\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/76cd11ad46c8449b1b652509cf50bb71\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:site_name\",\"content\":\"Academic Resource Discovery\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:locale\",\"content\":\"en_US\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:image:width\",\"content\":\"1200\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:image:height\",\"content\":\"630\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"og:image:alt\",\"content\":\"Attitudes to Pensions Survey, 2012\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"website\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary_large_image\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"Attitudes to Pensions Survey, 2012\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$14\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"17\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]]\nc:null\n"])</script></body></html>
