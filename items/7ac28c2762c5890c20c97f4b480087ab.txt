12:Tb40,The development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and the consequent prospect of future limits to medical treatments, continues to be a major public health concern. Use of antibiotics in livestock production is suggested as one of the routes for antimicrobial resistance to develop. Although policy initiatives and information campaigns have led to large reductions in antibiotic use by the UK livestock industry, further reductions are likely to require new approaches. Antibiotic use is sometimes necessary, leading to challenging decisions that balance the immediate health and welfare of animals against the longer-term risk of AMR. Using rapid, or pen-side diagnostics for more discriminating use of antibiotics in that sector has been advocated as a novel method of reducing the prospect for antimicrobial resistance to develop. A number of scientific developments have led to the growth in the number of innovative products that could be used for this purpose, many created in university spin-out companies. However, their use in the industry is limited to date. Our research sought to identify why this is the case.
The main objectives of the research were to: 
• understand how to support the development of novel diagnostics to address antimicrobial 
resistance in livestock. 
• assess how diagnostic innovation can be facilitated by regulatory and governance systems.  
• identify the key factors for ensuring uptake and developing successful markets for rapid 
diagnostics. 
The data set consists of telephone interviews with representatives of 13 diagnostic developers, industry bodies and government agency.
The research stems from a UK cross- research council initiative on antimicrobial resistance.The widespread use of antibiotics in livestock farming, in many circumstances, increasingly serves as alternative to the diagnosis, targeted treatment and prevention of disease in individual animals, flocks and herds. Relationships and practices between diagnosis, prescription, treatment and prevention have become stretched to the point of rupture, a rupture thrown into sharp focus by the issue of AMR. Better, smarter, more rapid and more accessible diagnoses, driven by a shift in the behaviours and conditions associated with diagnostic decision making (whether performed in the laboratory or at the point-of-care by veterinarians or farmers) represents a critical step to delivering a more effective and sensible use of antibiotic medicines in animal health. Improvements in diagnostic development and practice, however, and in their relationship to prescription and treatment, require social, governance and technical innovations, understanding the parameters and conditions of which demands urgent research. In this research, we ask: "What needs to be in place to develop better conditions for a diagnostic-led approach to animal care and treatment?"13:Tb40,The development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and the consequent prospect of future limits to medical treatments, continues to be a major public health concern.
