12:Tad4,The data in this collection include transcripts of group discussions held in two urban centres in each country - the capital city and a secondary town - and the questionnaire surveys conducted with small samples (80 respondents in Cambodia, 100 in Nepal) to validate the key findings from the group discussions. Urban food security, or the lack of it, is attracting growing interest in policy debates. Glaringly missing in these conversations, however, are the voices of the urban poor. To fill this gap, grassroots community organisations affiliated to the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights (ACHR) with decades-long experience in collecting data on their own communities decided to ask the urban poor in Cambodia and Nepal how they define and measure food security, what key challenges they face in the daily struggle to put food on the table and what actions might help.Urbanisation in low-income nations presents both opportunities and immense challenges. As urban centres grow rapidly, inadequate housing and the lack of basic infrastructure and services affect a large and growing proportion of their population. There is also a growing body of evidence on urban poverty and its links with environmental hazards. There is, however, limited knowledge of how these challenges affect the ways in which poor urban residents gain access to food and secure healthy and nutritious diets. There is also limited understanding of how different forms of conflict/fragility affect food security and nutrition of the urban poor. 
Poor communities usually have little voice but enormous and in-depth knowledge of their contexts, and of the priorities for action. And while local governments in low-income nations have a key role in reducing poverty and increasing environmental sustainability, they are typically under-resourced and unable to gather sufficient, timely and reliable data on rapidly changing contexts where urban growth and the erosion of natural resources overlap and can lead to conflict. 
Working with poor community organisations led by women in cities in Cambodia and Nepal, this project lets the poor themselves define and measure food security and nutrition using methods and tools that include the use of innovative but affordable technology. The collection of data and their analysis provides the groundwork for a dialogue that brings together grassroots organisations of the urban poor, local governments and other stakeholders. This, in turn, sets the basis for the co-production of solutions that respond to the needs of local low-income communities. At the same time, the knowledge developed informs global debates on policy that addresses the intersection of poverty, environmental sustainability and institutional fragility that can lead to conflict.13:Tad4,The data in this collection include transcripts of group discussions held in two urban centres in each country - the capital city and a secondary town - and the questionnaire surveys conducted with small samples (80 respondents in Cambodia, 100 in Nepal) to validate the key findings from the group discussions.
