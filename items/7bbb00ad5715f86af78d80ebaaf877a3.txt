12:T7e8,The main method of the project was a survey interview from which both qualitative and quantitative data were collected. Field research was undertaken in marginalised rural communities in Zambia (Chiawa) and India (Sarguja district, Chhattisgarh state). Two rounds of fieldwork were undertaken in each place, in Zambia August–November 2010 (Zambia T1) and August–October 2012 (Zambia T2);
in India February–May 2011 (India T1) and February–June 2013 (India T2). In both locations, we talked to husbands and wives (separately) and women heading households. 
In India we surveyed 340 people in 2011 and 368 in 2013. 187 respondents were interviewed in both rounds. 7% of respondents were single women. Qualitative data include 105 survey notes. 
In Zambia we surveyed 412 people in 2010 and 370 in 2012. These included 52 women heading households. 358 respondents were surveyed both years. Qualitative data include notes from 105 survey interviews.
This research aims to identify pathways of wellbeing and poverty within rural communities in Zambia and India. It will demonstrate how poverty affects wellbeing and how different constellations of wellbeing in turn affect people's movements into, within and out of poverty. 
Drawing on the sociology of development and psychology, it adopts a mixed method, cross-cultural longitudinal approach, with qualitative and quantitative data collection across a two year interval, involving 700 respondents. Statistical tests assess the validity and reliability of our model of wellbeing. In-depth case studies provide a deeper sense of people's own understandings and experience. In particular, the research tests a key hypothesis that social and personal relationships constitute critical drivers of wellbeing in developing countries. 

The project is rooted in research-policy engagement. It involves partnership with NGOs committed to incorporating wellbeing into their programmes, and generates a broader programme of communications activities at national and global level.13:T7e8,The main method of the project was a survey interview from which both qualitative and quantitative data were collected.
