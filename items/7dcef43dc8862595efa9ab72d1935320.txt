12:T944,Prior to COVID-19, the NHS England Workforce Race Equalities Standard (WRES) found that ethnic minority staff experience considerably greater levels of workplace harassment and discrimination, lower pay, less control and poorer working conditions than White British staff [1]. Since the outbreak, these adverse working conditions have been exacerbated. Ethnic minority staff experience increased exposure to these workplace adversities, placement in more vulnerable positions, and disempowerment from complaining about deleterious working conditions. These ethnic disparities need to be addressed if we are to avoid the social, economic, and moral costs of excessive adverse mental health and occupational outcomes for ethnic minority staff.

This study aims to identify ethnic inequalities in mental health and occupational outcomes amongst NHS staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interviews will be conducted with i) participants of the CHECK survey, ii) London healthcare practitioners (HCPs, e.g., nurses and healthcare assistants) who were interviewed as part of the Tackling Inequalities and Discrimination Experiences (TIDES) study before COVID-19, and iii) NHS managers and senior staff nationally. Findings will be used to develop education and training materials to support BAME NHS staff nationally through collaboration with psychologists (KCL Virtual Reality (VR) Lab), medical educators (e.g., Maudsley Learning) and equality and diversity professionals (Challenge Consultancy).Prior to COVID-19, the NHS England Workforce Race Equalities Standard (WRES) found that ethnic minority staff experience considerably greater levels of workplace harassment and discrimination, lower pay, less control and poorer working conditions than White British staff [1].
