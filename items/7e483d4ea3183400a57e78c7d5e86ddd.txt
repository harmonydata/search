12:T4b5,The aim of this project is to support children aged 11-14 in coming to understand themselves and their world through a new approach of scripted inquiry learning. With the aid of software running on both mobile and desktop computers, children will be able to investigate issues that affect their lives across different settings, including the classroom, their homes and discovery centres, through a scientific process of gathering and assessing evidence, conducting experiments and engaging in informed debate. Their activities will be based around the topic themes of Myself, My Environment, and My Community. The project will design and evaluate the teaching and technology in parallel, through a series of focus groups, design workshops, and discussions of prototypes. The key questions driving the design and evaluation are: How can scripted inquiry learning support effective learning across transitions between formal and informal settings? How do school students and their teachers adopt the technologies as tools for learning? How does the experience of scripted inquiry learning assist and change learning activities? How do scripted inquiry learning activities develop children's learning skills?13:T4b5,The aim of this project is to support children aged 11-14 in coming to understand themselves and their world through a new approach of scripted inquiry learning.
