12:T70a,Children Creating Kinship, 2004-2006 explores how children create kinship in their everyday lives. The aim of the study was to examine the range of relationships which matter to children and ask how children experience, shape and give meaning to these relationships. 

Relationships with parents and friends are often seen as most significant in children's lives. However, relationships (both past and present) with others such as relatives, carers, neighbours, pets, mentors, teachers and professionals may also be very important and meaningful to children. Therefore, in this study, kinship has been defined broadly, fluidly and from the perspectives of children themselves. In exploring how children create kinship with others, the study focuses not only on children's attitudes to kin relationships, but also on the kinship practices in their everyday lives. Special interest was given to how children are active participants in family life and in the ways they are involved in building and maintaining relationships. The focus on everyday kinship practices seeks to recognise that kinship is negotiated both through daily, ordinary activities as well as during the more unusual events (such as family change) which are also woven into everyday experience. 

The study available from the UKDA comprises semi-structured interviews with 41 children.  Photographs and drawings by the children which formed part of the interviews are not available.  All names and places have been anonymised. Users should note that access to the data files are subject to permission being granted by the depositor (see Access section below).
