12:Tbbe,Across the world, the number of migrants displaced by civil conflict is on the rise. Recent estimates suggest that nearly 65.6 million people have been forcibly displaced within their own countries or across borders, and that most of them (84 percent) are living in developing countries (UNHCR 2017). Despite the persistence and scale of this displacement, there exists little evidence, or even basic data, addressing the core policy problem: what type of programs should be prioritized to maintain or improve the wellbeing of natives and refugees. The Cox's Bazar Panel Survey (CBPS) endeavours to provide such data through a comprehensive, large-sample survey that tracks both host and refugee households over time in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, the site of one of the world's largest refugee camps.Â The Baseline Survey is intended to be the first round of a multi-year panel survey, and it is hoped that at least three rounds of data will be collected, with one to three years between rounds.The Baseline Survey has been administrated by Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), Yale University, The World Bank, and the Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence (GAGE) (an initiative funded by the Overseas Development Institute, UK Department for International Development) in 5,016 households from six upazilas in Cox's Bazar District: Chakaria, Cox's Bazar Sadar, Ramu, Teknaf, Ukhia, and Pekua; and one upazila in Bandarban District which hosts a significant refugee population. The study aims to capture household and individual level data, and is representative of two core groups of residents in Cox's Bazar: Refugees who resided in camps: This includes newly arrived refugees, defined as residents of the 27 internationally-recognized camps who migrated during or after August 2017; and previously arrived refugees who are residing in camps. The host mauza population: This includes natives, defined as households where the head was born in Bangladesh; and non-natives (which will include Rohingya refugees, as well as other households with heads born outside Bangladesh) who are resident outside camp.The Cox's Bazar Panel Survey: Baseline, 2019 shares a sample with Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence: Bangladesh-Dhaka Baseline, 2017-2018 (available under SN 8594). All CBPS households with at least one adolescent aged 10-12 or 15-17 were included in the GAGE random sample. This included 1,040 households in camps and 1,288 households in host communities. This study includes merged data files which include both the GAGE and CBPS data from sampled households.
The Coxâs Bazar Panel Survey: Baseline, 2019 consists of two sections:a household interview (HH) conducted with one adult household member covering household roster, food security, consumption, assistance, assets, household income, anthropometrics of one randomly selected child under five;Â an adult interview conducted with two randomly selected adults covering labour market outcomes, migration, crime and conflict, and health.13:Tbbe,Across the world, the number of migrants displaced by civil conflict is on the rise.
