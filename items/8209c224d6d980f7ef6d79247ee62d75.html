The aims of the Parental Rights Survey, 2019 (part of the Maternity and Paternity Rights series (MPRS)), were to:

Monitor take-up of maternity and paternity benefits and how this has changed;
Understand the impact of key legislative changes in parental rights since 2009-10, including the introduction of Shared Parental Leave and Pay (SPL and P) and rights for fathers and partners to attend antenatal appointments;
Examine the factors contributing to parents&#x27; decisions in this area and the factors that enable women to remain in work;
Explore parental attitudes towards childcare responsibility and how this has changed;
Provide a detailed, statistically representative, up-to-date picture of mothers&#x27; experiences and take-up of maternity rights and benefits;
Examine changes in mothers&#x27; engagement and experience in the labour market prior to, and following, the birth of their child;
Track changes (if any) for mothers since the 2009/10 survey;
Identify differences in take-up and eligibility across key demographic, socioeconomic and occupation groups, and how these have changed (if at all) since 2009/10; 
Provide a detailed, statistically representative and up-to-date picture of fathers&#x27; take-up of Paternity Leave and Paternity Pay in order to collect robust data on the various provisions for fathers during and after the mothers&#x27; pregnancies;
