Frailty is a critical measure in health care for evidence-based clinical decision making and an accurate electronic Frailty Index (eFI) at admission will be beneficial to both patients and medical service for prompt and appropriate assessment and management in acute care.

An accurate and valid eFI will be beneficial to both patients and emergency care services for prompt and appropriate assessment and management.

Since 2020, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was introduced to QE as a way to screen and quantify frailty and fitness of individual patients with Covid 19 at admission. Essentially, CFS is a value derived from 92 baseline variables (also referred to as deficits) using a cumulative model, although studies have shown feasibility of reducing the number of variables without loss of predictive ability. In addition, CFS is judgement-based and requires specially trained clinicians to perform a series of measurements and determine the presence or absence of each deficit.

An eFI that was derived from 31 routinely collected test results showed that it has promising identification power for high risk frailty patients in aged cohort (&gt;65), indicating the potential of having a simpler and more efficient model for frailty estimation.
