12:T12fd,The People and Nature Survey for England is one of the main sources of data and statistics on how people experience and think about the environment. It began collecting data in April 2020 and has been collecting data since. The survey builds on the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) survey which ran from 2009 to 2019. Data from the People and Nature Survey for England enables users to:understand how people use, enjoy, and are motivated to protect the natural environmentmonitor changes in use of the natural environment over time, at a range of different spatial scales and for key groups within the populationunderstand how being in the natural environment can influence wellbeingunderstand environmental attitudes and the actions people take at home, in the garden and in the wider community to protect the environmentThis data contributes to Natural England’s delivery of statutory duties, informs Defra policy and natural capital accounting, and contributes to the outcome indicator framework for the 25 Year Environment Plan.Different versions of the People and Nature Survey for England are available from the UK Data Archive under Open Access (SN 9092) conditions, End User Licence (SN 9093), and Secure Access (SN 9094).
