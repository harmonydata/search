Further information and a list of variable names and descriptions from which quantitative data have been redacted are provided at the end of the accompanying README file.The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of adolescents in Scotland who have experienced a bereavement. Findings from our previous quantitative schools-based investigation were explored further through qualitative in-depth interviews to learn more about the factors influencing young people’s bereavement experiences and outcomes. A further aim was to learn more about young people’s experiences with self-harm (thoughts or behaviours), through a brief self-report questionnaire and card sorting task. 
A total of 13 adolescents (aged 16-18) were recruited for the study from various sources, all of whom had experienced a bereavement. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by the researcher, with salient uses of gesture and critical observations noted. The interview topics were structured in a way to learn more about the person who died, the relationship, knowledge about the death, impact on daily life, coping, social support, and beliefs around suicide. The transcriptions have been pseudo-anonymised. 
Participants also completed a short self-report questionnaire on self-harm experiences, and some individuals took part in an optional card sorting task (Card Sort Task for Self-harm; Townsend et al., 2016) to learn more about their experiences surrounding past episodes of self-harm (thoughts or behaviours). This task involves individuals sorting cards relating to possible thoughts, feelings, behaviours, events, services and supports, and outcomes surrounding their first and last episodes of self-harm. Participants also rated their confidence in the accuracy of their recollections. Finally, a visual analogue scale of mood was used to gauge changes in emotional state at the start and end of the interview, and after the CaTS task if applicable. 
This research offers valuable insights into the experience of young people in Scotland who have experienced the death of someone important to them, and findings (derived through a thematic analysis of the data) suggest that young people experience a wide range of reactions and responses following death, covering issues such as: reactions to death, systems of support, agency and power, personal growth and perspectives, and accumulating loss."/><meta property="og:title" content="Experiences of Bereavement and Self-harm among Adolescents in Scotland, 2019-2020"/><meta property="og:description" content="This dataset contains qualitative and quantitative data from a mixed methods interview study with young people, with the purpose of exploring bereavement experiences among adolescents in Scotland, as well as experiences with self-harm thoughts or behaviours.

Findings from our previous quantitative schools-based investigation were explored further through qualitative in-depth interviews to learn more about the factors influencing young people’s bereavement experiences and outcomes. A further aim was to learn more about young people’s experiences with self-harm (thoughts or behaviours), through a brief self-report questionnaire and card sorting task. \nA total of 13 adolescents (aged 16-18) were recruited for the study from various sources, all of whom had experienced a bereavement. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by the researcher, with salient uses of gesture and critical observations noted. The interview topics were structured in a way to learn more about the person who died, the relationship, knowledge about the death, impact on daily life, coping, social support, and beliefs around suicide. The transcriptions have been pseudo-anonymised. \nParticipants also completed a short self-report questionnaire on self-harm experiences, and some individuals took part in an optional card sorting task (Card Sort Task for Self-harm; Townsend et al., 2016) to learn more about their experiences surrounding past episodes of self-harm (thoughts or behaviours). This task involves individuals sorting cards relating to possible thoughts, feelings, behaviours, events, services and supports, and outcomes surrounding their first and last episodes of self-harm. Participants also rated their confidence in the accuracy of their recollections. Finally, a visual analogue scale of mood was used to gauge changes in emotional state at the start and end of the interview, and after the CaTS task if applicable. \nThis research offers valuable insights into the experience of young people in Scotland who have experienced the death of someone important to them, and findings (derived through a thematic analysis of the data) suggest that young people experience a wide range of reactions and responses following death, covering issues such as: reactions to death, systems of support, agency and power, personal growth and perspectives, and accumulating loss."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"14:Tb5d,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"This dataset contains qualitative and quantitative data from a mixed methods interview study with young people, with the purpose of exploring bereavement experiences among adolescents in Scotland, as well as experiences with self-harm thoughts or behaviours.
