More people claim out-of-work incapacity benefits than unemployment benefits in the UK, and this has been true throughout the recent recession - but we know little about what the public think about incapacity benefits.
The data collection consists of: 
 (1) Quantitative data: includes a comparative YouGov study of the UK and Norway, giving each respondent three pen-portraits (&#x27;vignettes&#x27;) of different sorts of disabled and non-disabled benefit claimant to see which factors influence the public&#x27;s responses. It also includes a follow-up study in the UK using the NatCen online panel. 
(2) Qualitative data include the results from six focus groups with the general public in the England in 2016, which also used vignettes but allowed a deeper investigation of how the public debated the situation of each one.Over a million older people claim incapacity benefits in Britain, on the grounds that their health or disability stops them from working - four times as many as those claiming unemployment benefits, despite the downturn.

Take two people with identical impairments: a London-based graduate and an unskilled person in Merthyr Tydfil.

The unskilled worker may have none of these options, particularly if they are older and therefore more likely to have lower qualifications, to be biologically &#x27;slowing down&#x27;, and to face age-related discrimination.

How should this be assessed? And should they be threatened with benefit sanctions if they don't do what Jobcentres ask them to do? \nMore people claim out-of-work incapacity benefits than unemployment benefits in the UK, and this has been true throughout the recent recession - but we know little about what the public think about incapacity benefits.\nThe data collection consists of: \n (1) Quantitative data: includes a comparative YouGov study of the UK and Norway, giving each respondent three pen-portraits ('vignettes') of different sorts of disabled and non-disabled benefit claimant to see which factors influence the public's responses. It also includes a follow-up study in the UK using the NatCen online panel. \n(2) Qualitative data include the results from six focus groups with the general public in the England in 2016, which also used vignettes but allowed a deeper investigation of how the public debated the situation of each one.Over a million older people claim incapacity benefits in Britain, on the grounds that their health or disability stops them from working - four times as many as those claiming unemployment benefits, despite the downturn.
