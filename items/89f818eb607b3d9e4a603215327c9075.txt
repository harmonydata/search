12:T1be4,This research project mapped and monitored responses to household food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments, local authorities, charities and local communities worked to ensure access to food for those facing new risks of food insecurity due to being unable to go out for food or due to income losses arising from the crisis. New schemes were developed, such as governments replacing incomes of people at risk of unemployment on account of lockdowns, providing food parcels for people asked to shield, referrals for people to receive voluntary help with grocery shopping, and free school meals replacement vouchers or cash transfers. These worked alongside existing provision for those unable to afford food – such as food banks – which have been adapting their services to continue to meet increasing demand from a range of population groups. This resulted in a complex set of support structures which developed and changed as the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impacts, evolved.

About the project

The project was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the UKRI Ideas to Address COVID-19 grant call and ran for two years from July 2020. The research aimed to provide collaborative monitoring and analysis of food support systems to inform food access policy and practice. The research team was led by the University of Sheffield and King’s College London alongside colleagues from Sustain: the alliance for better food and farming and Church Action on Poverty. Full details of the team are below. Collaboration with partners and stakeholders was at the heart of the project. The research team worked with stakeholders from national and local government, the civil service, third sector, NGOs as well as people who were accessing food and financial assistance during the pandemic.

The End of project summary of key findings were published in August 2022. Details of the workpackages and research reports can be found below.

Project work packages

Work package 1: National level food access systems mapping and monitoring

Looking at food access support across the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic, national level mapping and monitoring was undertaken in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales as well as at a UK level. National level stakeholders (for example from devolved governments and national voluntary organisations) from across the four nations worked with us to understand and monitor  how support for food access has operated and evolved across the UK.

Work package 2: Participatory Policy Panel

To fully understand food access responses, it was crucial to hear directly from those with lived experience of food insecurity during the pandemic. In partnership with Church Action on Poverty, we convened a participatory policy panel made up of people who have direct experience of a broad range of support to access food. Meeting regularly throughout the project (Oct 2020-Dec 2021), the panel used a range of participatory and creative methods to share and reflect on their experiences and contribute these to policy recommendations.

Work package 3: Local area case studies

Fourteen local areas across the UK were the focus for more in depth case study research. Working with local stakeholders in each area, the research mapped what local responses looked like and how they operated. The research followed the developments in these areas throughout the duration of the project.

The project was undertaken with ethical approval from the University of Sheffield.Working with national governments across the UK - including Defra's Food Vulnerability Directorate, the Scottish and Welsh governments and the Food Standards Agency, this project will apply a systems approach to enable understanding and monitoring of the array of activities to enhance or provide food access to vulnerable people during the COVID-19 outbreak, including both financial and direct access. Reflecting Defra's Food Vulnerability focus, target groups include people with low incomes, shielded individuals, and the 'non-shielded vulnerable'. 

The aims of this project are to:
- Undertake comprehensive mapping of the food access systems, highlighting key areas of vulnerability within them and identifying links to other support systems.
- Using a case study approach, develop and apply methods for monitoring and evaluating the food access for vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 outbreak and through the easement of lockdown restrictions.
- Develop 'exit strategies' for managing the transition out of systems that will not be provided after the crisis.
- Establish 'best practice' protocols for resiliency planning for the future.

The project methods include collaborative systems mapping, local area case studies (collating qualitative and quantitative data) and in-depth interviews with system users and other key actors.

The project will provide policymakers with a comprehensive overview of food access activities for vulnerable groups and identification of key gaps and weaknesses within this system, informed by stakeholders who use these systems and those contributing to them. Civil society and business communities benefit by directly informing this work, but also from its evaluative and monitoring components, enabling them to identify and refine their efforts in the wider context.13:T1be4,This research project mapped and monitored responses to household food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Reflecting Defra's Food Vulnerability focus, target groups include people with low incomes, shielded individuals, and the 'non-shielded vulnerable'. 

The aims of this project are to:
- Undertake comprehensive mapping of the food access systems, highlighting key areas of vulnerability within them and identifying links to other support systems.
- Using a case study approach, develop and apply methods for monitoring and evaluating the food access for vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 outbreak and through the easement of lockdown restrictions.
- Develop 'exit strategies' for managing the transition out of systems that will not be provided after the crisis.
- Establish 'best practice' protocols for resiliency planning for the future.

The project methods include collaborative systems mapping, local area case studies (collating qualitative and quantitative data) and in-depth interviews with system users and other key actors.

The project will provide policymakers with a comprehensive overview of food access activities for vulnerable groups and identification of key gaps and weaknesses within this system, informed by stakeholders who use these systems and those contributing to them. Civil society and business communities benefit by directly informing this work, but also from its evaluative and monitoring components, enabling them to identify and refine their efforts in the wider context.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Food Vulnerability during COVID-19, 2020-2023"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$12"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Food Vulnerability during COVID-19, 2020-2023"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$13"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/89f818eb607b3d9e4a603215327c9075"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Food Vulnerability during COVID-19, 2020-2023"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Food Vulnerability during COVID-19, 2020-2023"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$14"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
