12:T798,To collect and analyse data on the social origins, university experiences, and career destinations of a 9 per cent stratified sample of Oxford University's twentieth-century members; to elaborate and develop computer methods used with large-scale collective biography; to elaborate taxonomic schemes used for social mobility studies of twentieth-century British middle-class groups; to provide social mobility data for twentieth-century British women hitherto absent from other social mobility studies. Social origins
Social class complexion of Oxford's intake (measured with respect to fathers' and mothers' occupations); geographical origins of Oxford's intake; level and type of secondary school attainment of Oxford's intake (Measured with respect to intake's education and that of their parents).
University experiences
Subject balance of student body (by sex, cohort, and any of the social origins variables outlined above); degree performance of student body (by sex, cohort, subject studied, and any of the social origins outlined above); university degrees and professional qualifications obtained at Oxford and other universities (by sex, cohort, subject studied, and any of the social origins outlined above);
Career destinations
Type of career (measured according to various taxonomic schemes, by sex, cohort, and any of the social origins and university experiences variables outlined above); geographical locations (by occupation, sex, cohort, and any of the social origins and university experiences variables outlined above); marital and family status (measured according to spouse(s)' occupation and educational attainments, by sex, cohort, and any of the social origins and university experiences variables outlined above).
