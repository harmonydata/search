It aimed to investigate the strategies and processes through which the police service in England and Wales communicates into the public sphere; it examined police interaction with media organisations and explored how people receive and make sense of mediated information about the police. The research activities involved: (a) undertaking a questionnaire survey of police force communications, media, and public relations (PR) offices ; (b) site visits to police forces, including interviews with police corporate communications managers/practitioners; (c) interviewing news-media professionals; and (d) conducting group discussions with local people in different sites within one police force area. Using these methods, the study brought together the three elements of police, media and audience into one integrated study that mapped the national context of police-media relations and then examined the communications dynamics at a local level.
