12:T58e,The Growing Up in England (GUiE) project aims to bring together demographic, geographic and household information from the 2011 Census with educational attainment information in a longitudinal cohort. 

The first key-milestone of the Growing Up in England was reached in July 2020 with a published report of the GUiE feasibility study. This feasibility or Proof of Concept (PoC) study demonstrated that data records from a bespoke abstract of the feasibility All Education Dataset England (AEDE) can successfully be linked to records from the 2011 Census. The 2011 Census includes an abundance of information on the characteristics of individuals and the households they occupy. The 2011 Census took place on March 27th, 2011. The feasibility AEDE is a large longitudinal record-level education dataset that covers predominantly government-funded education in England up to the academic year 2014/15. The PoC study only used part of the feasibility AEDE data; specifically, data from the National Pupil Database (NPD) and the English School Census (Spring). 

This record outlines the second key-milestone of the GUiE project which are the Wave-1 dataset. Wave-1 was created by linking data from the 2011 Census to records from the NPD and Individualized Learner Records (ILR). While the PoC dataset only covered the academic years 2010/11-2014/15, the Wave-1 datasets include information across the years 2001/02-2014/15.13:T58e,The Growing Up in England (GUiE) project aims to bring together demographic, geographic and household information from the 2011 Census with educational attainment information in a longitudinal cohort.
