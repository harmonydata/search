 the multidimensionality of immigrant adaptation in British academia (via a meta-analysis of the current literature and quantitative analysis of secondary data).

Which will be contrasted with the subjective understandings and perceptions of adaptation in Britain among:
- policy makers and third-sector stakeholders (via an analysis of policy documents and interviews)
- minority and majority groups among the British population (via focus groups).

Perspectives on the adaptations of immigrants in Britain'. The main aim of the project was to examine perceptions of adaptation in academic, policy, and public spheres. \n\nThe research generated new data in the form of: (1) focus groups  conducted in Manchester and Glasgow between November 2014 and September 2015; (2) interviews with local and national 'policy stakeholders' conducted between January 2015 and September 2016. This data collection provides access to this new data and related documentation. The research also used existing data from various sources: (a) Existing surveys available via the UK Data Service such as: (1) Ethnic Minority British Election Study; (2) Citizenship Survey; and (3) Understanding Society. This data collection provides scripts that showed how the data was transformed for analysis. (b) Textual data from journal article abstracts; newspaper articles; and Hansard debates. This data collection provides details of the methodology used to extract such data.
