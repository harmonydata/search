The study sought to develop a new, theoretically informed measure of quality of life in early old age, examining whether and to what extent people experience a
‘Third Age’ of independence and satisfaction during the post-retirement phase of life, and what factors may influence this experience.

The 2004 project followed participants who were interviewed in both 1997 and 2000.  The aim of this study was to identify, in a small cohort, contextual and life course influences on change in quality of life and physiological status through early old age.

For the second edition (June 2008), follow-up data for 2000 and 2004 were added to the original 1997 data.  Additional documentation was also made available.

 The original 1997 dataset contains a full residential and occupational history for 294 subjects. 
Basic demographic data includes: parental social class, year of birth, site of original survey, number of siblings, year of marriage, social class of spouse, number of children. 
For each residence the data includes: period of residence, house type, number of rooms, tenure, number of occupants, heating, damp, proximity to factories (pre-1960), proximity to A-roads (post-1960), area type.
For each occupation the data includes: period of employment, social class, presence and type of fumes and dusts, was the work arduous, demand-control score.
Current living conditions and health data include: car ownership, number of state and occupational pensions, social class, smoking status, long-standing and limiting illness, medication, blood pressure, spirometry, height, weight, leg length. Total hazard exposure scores are also included.

The 2000 and 2004 datasets contain follow-up questions about the respondent since last in interview and further questions about everyday life, health, retirement and pensions.
