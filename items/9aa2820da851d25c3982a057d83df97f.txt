12:T7c9,The attached data is in the form Planes de Vidas (communal management plans) of Indigenous communities on the Inuya and Purús Rivers, in Peruvian Amazonia. These were produced using collaborative approaches to collect and record data from the communities. As well as offering key data on specific communities, the Planes de Vidas also outline issues each community currently faces as well as community members’ own agreed plans and aspirations for the future. The ones included here were produced as part of a project, “The Making of an Integrated Landscape of Conservation” centred on supporting Indigenous communities within Peru’s designated the Purús-Manú conservation corridor to evaluate the social, environmental and development challenges they face and then plan pathways to their desired futures.

The Planes de Vidas include information on the natural resources, history, economics, politics, and social and cultural aspects of the communities. As well as collecting data from physical observations and measurements, socio-cultural and historical data was collected in collaborative, communal workshops and discussions with a range of representative participants from all parts of the communities. The specific Comunidades Nativas included are San Juan de Inuya, Bola de Oro, Catay, Renacimiento Asháninca, San Marcos and Sinai. N.b. all documents are in Spanish.Focused on the Purus-Manu conservation corridor in Peruvian Amazonia and innovating around Plan de Vida methodologies, the project centres on supporting Indigenous communities to evaluate the social, environmental and development challenges they face and then plan pathways to their desired futures. Drawing on the project team’s wider collaborative network of relevant, Indigenous federations and institutions and governmental and non-governmental organisations the project then seeks to engage with the challenges raised by the research to inform relevant actions, interventions and guide policy changes.13:T7c9,The attached data is in the form Planes de Vidas (communal management plans) of Indigenous communities on the Inuya and Purús Rivers, in Peruvian Amazonia.
