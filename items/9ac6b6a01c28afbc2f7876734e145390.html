Trying to understand how readers code letter position and then use that information to identify familiar words is one of the most topical research areas in the psychology of reading. For a long time most theories claimed that readers code letter position in terms of mental representations of letters that are position-specific, e.g., CAT would be coded by C-1, A-2, and T-3. Recently, we and others have accumulated evidence highlighting problems with this approach. Three alternative theories of letter position coding have been developed to address these problems.
