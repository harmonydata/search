Moreover significant questions exist around which resilience capacities to measure, how to measure them, and how to weight them for their relative importance in facilitating or hindering resilience in any given context.  Subjective approaches to resilience measurement may offer an attractive alternative, because they ask respondents for a rating of their overall perceived resilience, thereby placing more emphasis on what resilience means to local people and leaving the choice of which capacities, in what combination and quantities, up to them.  This data facilitates longitudinal quantitative comparison of the power of subjective and objective resilience measures to predict future wellbeing (in this case, represented by household food security) in the face of socio-environmental shocks and stressors in three contrasting case-study locations within Kyrgyzstan.e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Testing the validity of subjective and objective indicators to predict future wellbeing in the face of climatic shocks and stressors 2017\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$12\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"Testing the validity of subjective and objective indicators to predict future wellbeing in the face of climatic shocks and stressors 2017\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"$13\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/item"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"s/9c4bc94184d5c7030cdc433bf44483d6\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:site_name\",\"content\":\"Academic Resource Discovery\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:locale\",\"content\":\"en_US\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:image:width\",\"content\":\"1200\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:image:height\",\"content\":\"630\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"og:image:alt\",\"content\":\"Testing the validity of subjective and objective indicators to predict future wellbeing in the face of climatic shocks and stressors 2017\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"website\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary_large_image\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"Testing the validity of subjective and objective indicators to predict future wellbeing in the face of climatic shocks and stressors 2017\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$14\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"17\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]]\nc:null\n"])</script></body></html>
