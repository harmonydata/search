12:T92b,This project brought together debates in Marketing, Social Geography and research from the Social Psychology of Consumption to investigate how young people negotiate and position themselves in relation to branded leisure spaces, and contemporary forms of ‘experiential’, ‘emotional’ and viral marketing. The project was conducted in two stages: Music Festivals; Free Parties. Each stage was organised around two case studies. Stage One compared a commercially sponsored and branded music festival held in an urban setting, with a less overtly branded event, but with substantial commercial involvement, held in a rural setting. The data set consists of on-site interviews (12 at each event) and a small number of follow up individual interviews (2) and email interviews (4). Stage Two compared 2 Free Parties held in urban and rural settings respectively. The data set consists of 8 individual interviews, 1 group interview and 1 email interview with free party associates. The corporate branding of youth culture is well documented, but how young people engage with contemporary branding and marketing practices has received far less attention. This project brings together debates in Marketing, Social Geography and research from the Social Psychology of Consumption to investigate how young people negotiate and position themselves in relation to branded leisure spaces, and contemporary forms of ‘experiential’, ‘emotional’ and viral marketing. The study will consider how young people negotiate commercially constituted spaces that are designed to offer them the opportunity to be ‘free’ and authentically ‘themselves’. It compares two types of music-related leisure event: Music festivals and free parties, both of which play a significant role in young adults’ lives, but have different levels of commercial involvement. Music festivals are increasingly branded events with substantial levels of commercial involvement, and relatively managed and regulated forms of consumption on offer. Free parties, by contrast, involve minimal levels of commercial involvement and have a history of opposition to a consumerist ethos. The project investigates the ways in which young adults position themselves and others in relation to the forms of branding, marketing and consumption on offer at these different leisure sites.13:T92b,This project brought together debates in Marketing, Social Geography and research from the Social Psychology of Consumption to investigate how young people negotiate and position themselves in relation to branded leisure spaces, and contemporary forms of ‘experiential’, ‘emotional’ and viral marketing.
