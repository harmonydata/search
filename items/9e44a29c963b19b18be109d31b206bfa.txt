12:T65a,The Citizenship Education Longitudinal Study (CELS) tracks the civic and political attitudes and dispositions of young people from the age of 11 to their mid-20s. ItÂ started in 2003 with a cohort of 11-12 year olds and has surveyed this cohort every two years until 2011 (Wave 5, held as SN 7230, Citizens in Transition: Civic Engagement among Young People, 2011. Users should note that the UKDS does not currently hold Waves 1-4).
This study consists of two components. The first component is Wave 6 of CELS. These data were collected in 2014, from 945 respondents aged 22-23, in England. This sample consists of 683 CELS Wave 5 respondents and a top-up group of 262 respondents drawn from a database of respondents to previous Omnibus surveys conducted by TNS. Data were collected in face to face interviews with a written questionnaire.
The second component comprises data collected via a cross-sectional online survey of 22-28 year olds. The sample consists of 2,000 respondents (1,000 in England, 500 in Wales and 500 in Scotland) and was supplied by TNS-BMRB's online panel partners. The respondents of both CELS Wave 6 and the online survey completed the same questionnaire.
Further information may be found on the Centre for Research on Learning and Life Chances (LLAKES) Citizenship Education Longitudinal Survey webpages.
The data cover the following topics:

civic and political participation and engagement
volunteering and unpaid work
institutional and social trust
tolerance and attitudes on immigrants
democracy
housing opportunities
perceptions of fair treatment
expectations for the future
