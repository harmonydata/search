Therefore, the aims of this data collection was to assess a sample of healthy UK adults within the East Anglia and East Midlands region and their potential genotype differences and see if there were any associations with their allelic information and improved training and health variables. To assess this, 17 participants preformed an 8-week training programme which included a 20-30 minute run, three times per week to improve cardio-respiratory fitness. Additionally 21 participants remained as the control group that did not partake in the training intervention to isolate the training effects. Within the overall data, we found there were a number of genotypes that individuals possessed that were significantly correlated to improved training fitness such as cardiorespiratory fitness and also improvements in body mass index.

Clinically, it is also an area of focus, especially for those that have poor fitness for the same reasons. Fundamentally, research has constantly reported that individuals respond differentially to identical health-based interventions, suggesting the involvement of a genetic component in individual responses to health, exercise and fitness markers.

Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate individual’s genotypes following a field-based running endurance programme within a previously untrained population within the UK. Participants were randomly assigned to either a training (n = 17) or control group (n = 21).

This is especially important for those that have poor fitness and are classed as untrained. Although this is well established, much of the current research has shown individuals respond differentially to identical training interventions. It has been speculated that the human genome, but more specifically genotypes, may be partly responsible for the differences in individual exercise responses and adaptations.
