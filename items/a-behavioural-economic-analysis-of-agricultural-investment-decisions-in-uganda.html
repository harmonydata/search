Policies that aim to increase agricultural productivity in such environments - policies on agricultural lending, research and extension, rural infrastructure, crop insurance, and so forth - need to take into account how farmers take agricultural investment decisions. However, crucial elements of their decision-making habits that relate to risky choices remain ill-understood. In this research project, economic experiments are used to advance the understanding of how farmers who face numerous threats to their livelihoods take risky investment decisions.

In these experiments, participants respond to real monetary incentives, which enables the investigation of salient features of their decision-making habits. First, potential biases in risky choice behaviour have been studied. Participants make several choices from among lotteries; the probabilities and possible outcomes of the lotteries are systematically varied, in order to measure whether certain risks tend to be exaggerated (or alternatively, downplayed) in participants’ minds. Second, the influence of social interaction on risky choice behaviour will be studied. Random pairs of participants are formed whose earnings in the experiment are pooled, and redistributed in accordance with local social norms.
