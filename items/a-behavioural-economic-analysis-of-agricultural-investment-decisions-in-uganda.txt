Second, the influence of social interaction on risky choice behaviour will be studied. Random pairs of participants are formed whose earnings in the experiment are pooled, and redistributed in accordance with local social norms.

The research has taken place among small-scale farmers in east Uganda.1d:["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:description","content":"$2c"}]

2d:Tcd1,The collection contains four sets of data files and related questionnaires and experimental scripts, preceded by three files that contextualise the data. The file "project overview.pdf" describes the project aims, how the data was collected, main findings and outputs such as publications and presentations. The file "Consent procedure.docx" describes how we elicited informed consent from research participants for collecting, archiving and sharing the data.The file "readme.txt" contains an index of all data files. Note that each of the four data sets is in a zipped folder. Each of the folders contains a file with the instructions and/or questionnaires for participants, as well as all relevant data files. All data files are self-explanatory, i.e. have variable and value labels.
1. The files "Probability weighting and subjective probabilities (data and scripts)" contain experimental data for common consequence ladders (probability weighting) and tempting fate and fatalism experiments (subjective probabilities). The scripts used for the three experiments are provided and serve as a guide to the data.
2. The files "Nature's frames experiment data and script" contain the data for a test of reference-dependent utility theory. The script used in the experiment is provided and serves as a guide to the data.
3. The files "Risk pooling experiment data and script" contain the data for a risk sharing experiment (with a focus on implications for risky investment behaviour). The script used in the experiment is provided and serves as a guide to the data.
4. The files "Household survey (data and questionnaire" contain the data for the household survey that accompanied the experiments; the questionnaire is provided too. The variable "token" is the unique ID that may be used for linking the household survey data and the experimental data.Farmers in developing countries operate in extraordinarily hazardous environments. Policies that aim to increase agricultural productivity in such environments - policies on agricultural lending, research and extension, rural infrastructure, crop insurance, and so forth - need to take into account how farmers take agricultural investment decisions. However, crucial elements of their decision-making habits that relate to risky choices remain ill-understood. In this research project, economic experiments are used to advance the understanding of how farmers who face numerous threats to their livelihoods take risky investment decisions.

In these experiments, participants respond to real monetary incentives, which enables the investigation of salient features of their decision-making habits. First, potential biases in risky choice behaviour have been studied. Participants make several choices from among lotteries; the probabilities and possible outcomes of the lotteries are systematically varied, in order to measure whether certain risks tend to be exaggerated (or alternatively, downplayed) in participants’ minds. Second, the influence of social interaction on risky choice behaviour will be studied. Random pairs of participants are formed whose earnings in the experiment are pooled, and redistributed in accordance with local social norms.
