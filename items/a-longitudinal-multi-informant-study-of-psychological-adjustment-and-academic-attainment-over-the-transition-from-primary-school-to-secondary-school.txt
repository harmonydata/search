2c:T8f8,A short-term UK longitudinal study following children making the transition from primary school to secondary school.  Questionnaire data were collected from pupils, parents and teachers on three occasions spaced 6 months apart beginning in the last term of primary school and ending in the last term of the first year of secondary school.  Information on attitudes to school and learning (e.g. concerns about transition, school connectedness), pupil psychological adjustment (e.g. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), personal characteristics (e.g. self-control),  relationships with others (e.g. parent-child relationship quality) and academic attainment (e.g. Key Stage 2 results in English, Maths and Science) were collected.  Moving from primary to secondary school involves a degree of apprehension for most pupils. Pupils
have to adapt to a more challenging school setting with different academic structures and
expectations as well as changes in social interactions with teachers and peers. A significant minority
of pupils experience a range of difficulties in adjusting to secondary school as shown by lower grades,
poor attendance and increased anxiety. This study aims to identify factors that make a successful
transition to secondary school more likely as well as to identify risk factors for a difficult transition.
The results will help to identify the most vulnerable pupils so that they can be given extra support. We
will follow a group of approximately 1000 pupils as they make the transition from primary school to
secondary school. We will collect information from pupils, parents and teachers and will ask about
pupils’ well-being, academic achievement, and their views about school and relationships with friends
and teachers. This information will be collected on three occasions beginning in the last term of
primary school and ending in the last term of the first year of secondary school. This will allow us to
examine how pupils change and adapt to secondary school over the course of the study. We will
investigate how friendships and relationships with teachers and parents can help pupils make a
positive transition to secondary school. Our aim is to develop an evidence base in order to help
support vulnerable pupils at the transition to secondary school.28:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2c"}]
