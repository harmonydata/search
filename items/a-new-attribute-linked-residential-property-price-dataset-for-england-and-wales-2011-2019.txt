This research outlines one approach which addresses this deficiency in England and Wales through combining transaction information from the official open Land Registry Price Paid Data (PPD) and property size information form the official open Domestic Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs). A four-stage data linkage is created to generate a new linked data, representing 79% of the full market sales in Land Registry PPD. This new linked dataset offers greater flexibility for the exploration of house price (house price per square metre) variation in England and Wales at different spatial scales over postcode unit between 2011 and 2019.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"A new attribute-linked residential property price dataset for England and Wales 2011-2019"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"A new attribute-linked residential property price dataset for England and Wales 2011-2019"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/a-new-attribute-linked-residential-property-price-dataset-for-england-and-wales-2011-2019"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"A new attribute-linked residential property price dataset for England and Wales 2011-2019"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"A new attribute-linked residential property price dataset for England and Wales 2011-2019"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
