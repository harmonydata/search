A four-stage data linkage is created to generate a new linked dataset, representing 79% of the full market sales in the Land Registry PPD. This new linked dataset details 5,732,838 transactions in England and Wales between 2011 and 2019, along with each property's total floor area and the number of habitable rooms. Codes for other commonly used spatial units from Output Area to Local Authority are also included in the dataset. This offers greater flexibility for the exploration of house price variation in England and Wales at different spatial scales. The data collection includes the scripts used for linkage, as well as the resulting dataset.Current residential house price variation research in the UK is limited by lack of an open and comprehensive house price database that contains both transaction price alongside dwelling attributes such as size. This research outlines one approach which addresses this deficiency in England and Wales through combining transaction information from the official open Land Registry Price Paid Data (PPD) and property size information form the official open Domestic Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs). A four-stage data linkage is created to generate a new linked data, representing 79% of the full market sales in Land Registry PPD. This new linked dataset offers greater flexibility for the exploration of house price (house price per square metre) variation in England and Wales at different spatial scales over postcode unit between 2011 and 2019.26:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2a"}]
