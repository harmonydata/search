A participatory whiteboard animation video project with an NCS &#x27;wave&#x27; of young people is also shared here (Method 8). Content and discussions across the data-set include the motivations, experiences and outcomes of NCS for regional delivery providers and young people, in the context of the overall project themes.
The wider project data-set includes archival research (Method 1) and policy analysis (Method 2) using copyrighted data from the National Archives, London and secondary sources widely available online. Furthermore, eight semi-structured interviews were conducted with key NCS &#x27;architects&#x27; (Method 3) and an ethnographic diary (Method 7), but these have not been shared due to anonymity and key identifying and personal content within the material.This research project examines the state&#x27;s motivations behind, the third sector&#x27;s engagement with, and young people&#x27;s experiences of, National Citizen Service (NCS) in England.
NCS is a voluntary summer scheme for 16 and 17 year olds delivered through a range of charities, private sector partnerships and youth organisations. Since its launch in 2011, 64,500 young people have participated in NCS and the scheme aims to be reaching 90,000 teenagers by 2014. The programme involves a series of social action projects, volunteering in the local community and a residential camp. Using NCS as a case-study, and positioning this new scheme within the historical context of youth citizenship development, this original research project addresses timely and policy-relevant debates on the state, civil society and third sector and significantly advances knowledge on citizenship, informal education, youth and volunteering. The project addresses the following research questions:
RQ1. What have been the objectives and spatial formations of youth citizenship training schemes in Britain over the last thirty years and how do these compare to NCS?
RQ2. How are &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;troubled&#x27; youth and families understood within the NCS framework and in what ways does the NCS programme seek to engage young people at the local, national, and global scale?
RQ3. What have been the motivations and experiences of youth service providers and volunteers delivering NCS since 2011?
RQ4. What have been the motivations, experiences and outcomes for young people participating in NCS since 2011?
The project will use a mixed-methodology combining archival research with quantitative and innovative qualitative research methods. The seven components are i) archival research at the National Archives, London ii) desk-based policy analysis iii) 24 semi-structured interviews with stakeholder organisations iv) an online survey with young people who have completed NCS v) 30 semi-structured interviews with a representative sample of NCS &#x27;graduates&#x27; vi) an ethnography of one NCS cohort in one region in 2015 vii) a participatory animated whiteboard-video project written and directed by young people from the 2015 cohort and produced by a professional animation company. This mixed methodology therefore tackles the challenges of providing a national overview of a scheme with diverse geographical coverage for maximum impact of research findings, whilst giving space for more in-depth and sustained engagement with one particular case-study for richer analysis.
Dr Mills will collaborate with a range of third sector charities during this project and engage in a host of diverse activities with academic and non-academic audiences. The potential application of the research findings will benefit policy-makers, third sector organisations, NCS providers, volunteers and young people. Overall, this Future Research Leader award seeks to maximise existing networks and foster new collaborations with a range of academics and user communities.
This research project is the centrepiece of a set of objectives that will be achieved through this Future Research Leader Award. During this project, Dr Mills will be based at the Department of Geography, Loughborough University via her current employment as a Lecturer in Human Geography. She is an expert on the historical geographies of youth citizenship and her previous research has focused on British youth movements including the Scouts, Guides, Woodcraft Folk and Jewish Lads&#x27; Brigade. A post-doctoral research assistant will be employed for 14 months to work on the proposed project."/><meta property="og:title" content="A rite of passage: National citizen service and the geographies of youth citizenship 2009-2016"/><meta property="og:description" content="This data-set comprises semi-structured interviews with representatives of current and former NCS regional delivery providers in the UK (Method 4) and NCS graduates who completed the programme between 2011-2015 (Method 6).

Furthermore, eight semi-structured interviews were conducted with key NCS 'architects' (Method 3) and an ethnographic diary (Method 7), but these have not been shared due to anonymity and key identifying and personal content within the material.This research project examines the state's motivations behind, the third sector's engagement with, and young people's experiences of, National Citizen Service (NCS) in England.\\nNCS is a voluntary summer scheme for 16 and 17 year olds delivered through a range of charities, private sector partnerships and youth organisations. Since its launch in 2011, 64,500 young people have participated in NCS and the scheme aims to be reaching 90,000 teenagers by 2014. The programme involves a series of social action projects, volunteering in the local community and a residential camp. Using NCS as a case-study, and positioning this new scheme within the historical context of youth citizenship development, this original research project addresses timely and policy-relevant debates on the state, civil society and third sector and significantly advances knowledge on citizenship, informal education, youth and volunteering. The project addresses the following research questions:\\nRQ1. What have been the objectives and spatial formations of youth citizenship training schemes in Britain over the last thirty years and how do these compare to NCS?\\nRQ2. How are 'good' and 'troubled' youth and families understood within the NCS framework and in what ways does the NCS programme seek to engage young people at the local, national, and global scale?\\nRQ3. What have been the motivations and experiences of youth service providers and volunteers delivering NCS since 2011?\\nRQ4. What have been the motivations, experiences and outcomes for young people participating in NCS since 2011?\\nThe project will use a mixed-methodology combining archival research with quantitative and innovative qualitative research methods.

This mixed methodology therefore tackles the challenges of providing a national overview of a scheme with diverse geographical coverage for maximum impact of research findings, whilst giving space for more in-depth and sustained engagement with one particular case-study for richer analysis.\\nDr Mills will collaborate with a range of third sector charities during this project and engage in a host of diverse activities with academic and non-academic audiences.
