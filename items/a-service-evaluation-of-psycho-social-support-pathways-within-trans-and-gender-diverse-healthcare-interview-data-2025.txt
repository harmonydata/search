Resultantly, this research conducted a service evaluation of one gender clinic in England. They are the first gender clinic to begin incorporating social support into their model of care. We collected open-ended survey data from 30 service users, reflecting 10% of total service users. This evaluation allowed us to understand whether social support delivered through an NHS pathway allows meaningful social connections that enhance health to be developed, or whether these are experienced as too artificial in comparison to finding social support through their own volition.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"A Service Evaluation of Psycho-Social Support Pathways within Trans and Gender Diverse Healthcare: Interview Data, 2025"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"A Service Evaluation of Psycho-Social Support Pathways within Trans and Gender Diverse Healthcare: Interview Data, 2025"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/a-service-evaluation-of-psycho-social-support-pathways-within-trans-and-gender-diverse-healthcare-interview-data-2025"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"A Service Evaluation of Psycho-Social Support Pathways within Trans and Gender Diverse Healthcare: Interview Data, 2025"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"A Service Evaluation of Psycho-Social Support Pathways within Trans and Gender Diverse Healthcare: Interview Data, 2025"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
