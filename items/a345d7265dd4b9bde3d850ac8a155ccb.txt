12:T8bf,The COVID-19 Infection Survey (CIS) was launched in England in mid-April 2020. Working with the University of Oxford, University of Manchester, UK Health Security Agency, Wellcome Trust, IQVIA and the Lighthouse Laboratories at the UK Biocentre Milton Keynes and Glasgow, its aim is to provide information on how many people across the UK have COVID-19 infection at a given point in time, either with or without symptoms and how many are ever likely to have had the infection. The purpose of this dataset is to understand the prevalence of the coronavirus in the UK population, using longitudinal data and including not only cross-sectional data but the inclusion of an antibody test for a sub-sample of people.

Demographic information is also included allowing for analysis by different variables to identify patterns and trends. The COVID-19 Community Infection Survey includes information on:
• how many people across England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland test positive for COVID-19 at a given point in time, regardless of whether they report experiencing symptoms
• the average number of new infections per week over the course of the study
• the number of people who test positive for antibodies, to indicate how many people are ever likely to have had the virus
• key demographic information (sex, age, occupation)

The dataset includes test results from nose and throat swabs and antibody test results to allow the calculation of prevalence and incidence rates of new COVID-19 infection rates, as well as key demographic information.

No personally identifiable information is included.

From July 2022, CIS moved from collecting data through study worker home visits to collecting data remotely. Findings from our impact assessments indicate this change to remote data collection had minimal impact on survey results, except for the percentage of people with a strong positive test reporting symptoms, which should not be considered equivalent across the two data collection methods. Results of our impact analysis for symptoms and other results can be found in our December 2022 Quality Report, and results of additional impact analyses can be found in our August and September 2022 Quality Reports, linked below.13:T8bf,The COVID-19 Infection Survey (CIS) was launched in England in mid-April 2020.
