12:T8f3,Workshop activity guide (PowerPoint attached) based off the Physical Activity Messaging Framework (PAMF) was used for the 4-hour focus group workshop on January 19, 2024 with 20 public participants aged 40-60 years old from the Greater Manchester area, United Kingdom. The aim of this workshop and study was to co-design strength training messaging guidance that aligns to the strength component of the UK's Chief Medical Officers' physical activity guidelines.

Three examples of poster outputs that adhere to the results from our co-designed messaging workshop are attached (Culture Change, Ups and Downs, and Model for my Children).

Participant consent was not sought for the availability of raw data for secondary qualitative analysis.Physical inactivity costs the UK 7 billion each year and is responsible for 1 in every 6 deaths. Although a number of exercise programmes have aimed to address the global challenge of ageing and inactivity, there continues to be a shortage of successful programmes in real-world settings. When older adults become inactive, they lose their strength and become weak. Older adults who are weak are more likely to have a fall, become hospitalized, depressed, develop diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and live in a care home much earlier than they should.

Providing people with an exercise programme while they are still healthy, and before they shown signs of muscle weakness can prevent these devastating outcomes. Exercise referral as a routine part of healthcare and providing all adults the opportunity and benefits of participating in exercise will also help to reduce health inequalities in later life. Research shows that doctors don't feel confident discussing or referring exercise to their patients. While our research shows that older adults and exercise providers are unaware of exercise guidelines, the benefits of exercise participation, and where to turn to for support. 

Our mission is to connect older adults with the tailored exercise programs that are proven to lower the risk of disability and disease. Our platform will be an easy-to-use tool for doctors and exercise providers to support exercise awareness, knowledge, referral, and support while its use will lead to a happier, healthier, and more active population.13:T8f3,Workshop activity guide (PowerPoint attached) based off the Physical Activity Messaging Framework (PAMF) was used for the 4-hour focus group workshop on January 19, 2024 with 20 public participants aged 40-60 years old from the Greater Manchester area, United Kingdom.
