12:T41a,Wrigley, Schofield, Oeppen and Davies' 'English Population History from Family Reconstitution 1580-1837' (1997) was important both for its scope and its methodology. It was based on data from 26 family reconstitutions carefully selected to represent 250 years of English demographic history (UKDA-SN-853082).  These data remain relevant for new research questions, such as studying the intergenerational inheritance of fertility and mortality. To expand their availability the family reconstitutions have been transcribed to Intermediate Data Structure (IDS) and an episode file for fertility analysis in this data collection.  
These files were used for fertility analysis in George Alter, Gill Newton, and Jim Oeppen, "Re-introducing the Cambridge Group Family Reconstitutions," Historical Life Course Studies (in review).  The contents and structure of IDS files are described in Alter, G., & Mandemakers, K. (2014). "The Intermediate Data Structure (IDS) for Longitudinal Historical Microdata, version 4".
