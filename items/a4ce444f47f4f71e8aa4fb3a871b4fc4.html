Women in Africa face the risk that something can go wrong in childbirth many times over during the course of their lives.  Emergency obstetric care (such as caesarean section) may save their lives, but their health and ability to work afterwards may be affected, and the high costs of the hospital treatment can cause great financial difficulties, pushing families into poverty.
