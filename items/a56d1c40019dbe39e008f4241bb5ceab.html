The main purpose of the research was to understand what users and non-users of public libraries want from the service. Although detailed data exist on the level and frequency of public library use across the population, there was less information on how people regard the quality of service, and on their reasons for using or not using public libraries.

If the library service is to retain existing users and encourage new visitors, it is vital to understand the expectations and experiences of the public, irrespective of whether people currently use public libraries or not. The study aimed to provide an up-to-date picture of what the public wants and values in library services, and help leaders to make decisions about the future development of the service.

The data were collected in two different phases:

Qualitative: This consisted of a series of focus groups across England with a diverse range of people who had differing attitudes to public libraries. These groups examined all aspects of people&#x27;s relationships with local public libraries and crucially allowed the researchers to explore many issues not covered satisfactorily by existing data.

Quantitative: This took the form of a telephone survey with a representative sample of the adult population of England. This phase&#x27;s principal focus was to corroborate the findings from the qualitative phase and identify further reasons behind usage or not of libraries and the factors that would encourage people to visit libraries more often.

Further information is available on the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council&#x27;s (MLA) Research Evidence Resources website.
 Qualitative: The focus groups explored themes such as current use of library services, awareness of the range of services, experience of and satisfaction with the current offer, motivations for use and non-use, barriers to greater use, changing patterns of usage over time and likelihood of future usage, suggestions for improvements, perceptions of the value of library services as a public service and to the wider community.

Quantitative research:  The telephone questionnaire consisted of attitudinal &#x27;closed&#x27; questions which focused on people’s experience of using libraries, reasons for using/not using libraries and testing views about what might encourage people to use libraries more.

Although detailed data exist on the level and frequency of public library use across the population, there was less information on how people regard the quality of service, and on their reasons for using or not using public libraries.\n\nIf the library service is to retain existing users and encourage new visitors, it is vital to understand the expectations and experiences of the public, irrespective of whether people currently use public libraries or not. The study aimed to provide an up-to-date picture of what the public wants and values in library services, and help leaders to make decisions about the future development of the service.\n\nThe data were collected in two different phases:\n\nQualitative: This consisted of a series of focus groups across England with a diverse range of people who had differing attitudes to public libraries.
