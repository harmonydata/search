12:T42c,Growing Up in England (GUiE) Wave-1 links 2011 Census data to the Department for Education’s feasibility All Education Dataset for England (AEDE), enabling demographic, geographic and household information to be linked to data on highest educational attainment across a longitudinal cohort. GUiE Wave-2 joins additional information on vulnerability measures from the Department for Education’s English School Census (ESC) to the Wave-1 data. 

The additional vulnerability measures which have been joined to the GUiE Wave-1 data include: special educational needs, free school meal eligibility, disability, absences and exclusions. 

Wave 3 addresses some missing data as well as expanding the coverage back to 2001/02 where the data was available to do so.

Children in Need (CIN) and Children Looked After (CLA) data have also been joined to GUiE Wave-1 as part of Wave-2, but these datasets are requested separately. Further information about this is available within the Growing Up in England Wave 2 – Children in Need, Children Looked After catalogue entry.13:T42c,Growing Up in England (GUiE) Wave-1 links 2011 Census data to the Department for Education’s feasibility All Education Dataset for England (AEDE), enabling demographic, geographic and household information to be linked to data on highest educational attainment across a longitudinal cohort.
