12:T910,The aims and objectives of this study were:
1. The collection of a large sample of original high-quality longitudinal data on individual migration in the past which can be used to provide both methodological and conceptual insights into the migration process
2. The development of a network of contacts with family historians who can provide detailed information on individual residential histories, and the subsequent evaluation of data provided by family historians for academic historical research
3. Analysis and interpretation of the longitudinal residential histories to examine the pattern and process of residential migration in Britain in the past, and to test a range of hypotheses against the new migration data
4. To relate the results of the research to existing theories on migration and social change, and to test exisiting theories against high-quality empirical evidence
5. To make appropriate data on residential migration in the past available to other researchers through The Data Archive, and to encourage interchange between family historians, genealogists and academic researchers. The key topics covered in this dataset are:
Spatial and temporal change in the regional pattern of migration in Britain.
The relationship between migration and urbanization.
Migration differentials by family grouping, gender and occupation.
Reasons for migration.
The changing relationship between home and workplace.
Individual appraisals of the impact of migration.
Variables
Individuals:
Gender; year and place of birth and death including grid reference; father's and mother's occupation; year started and finished working; number of occupations; marital history; years first and last child born; number of live children born; total number of times moved. 
Residential moves:
Distance moved; year of move; age at time of move; marital status; place of birth including grid reference; household composition at time of move; reason for moving; assistance with moving; housing tenure; occupation before and after move; place of work before and after move including grid reference;
Standard Measures
Occupation coding based on Armstrong, see documentation for details.

Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research.13:T910,The aims and objectives of this study were:
