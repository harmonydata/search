12:T9dd,The aims of the project were to enhance understanding of cultures in community-based learning centres (CLCs) in further education in Scotland, and to identify areas for change in these cultures and work with Further Education (FE) colleges to implement changes. These aims were pursued through a series of interviews with staff and learners at the CLCs. The project was based on an ethnographic study of staff and learner perspectives about working and studying in CLCs. 

Approximately 80 interviews were conducted with staff and learners at CLCs attached to two FE colleges in the West of Scotland (this data collection includes 76 interviews, 50 with learners and 26 with staff). Each of the colleges participated fully in the project. For example, each college provided a member of staff to act as Research Fellow on the research team and this gave the team a useful link in partnership with the colleges. The Research Fellows were seconded one day per week to be involved in planning research, collecting data and carrying out interviews, analysing data and writing up research.

Drawing on the work of Bourdieu, concepts of 'field' and 'habitus' were used to interpret the data in relation to the learning and teaching context and the dispositions of staff and learners in the context. Learning cultures were explored in terms of the different types of learning relationships which were identified in the setting and which structured daily interactions between staff and learners. 

The study highlighted the importance of community-based learning in strategies of widening participation and provided insight into the permeable boundaries that exist in CLCs.

Further information, including documents and publications, may be found on the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Understanding and Enhancing Learning in Community-Based Further Education project web page.

 Topics covered in the learner interviews include: course studied; time at college; subjects covered; how respondent discovered course; other courses taken; college environment and peer relationships; employment history; reason for choice of course; motivation and course work; learning experience at school and college; demographic information, such as age and household composition.

Topics covered in the staff interviews include: role and courses taught; work with students, provision of learning experience and skills required; college environment; senior management of college; outreach and community liaison; and background in teaching.13:T9dd,The aims of the project were to enhance understanding of cultures in community-based learning centres (CLCs) in further education in Scotland, and to identify areas for change in these cultures and work with Further Education (FE) colleges to implement changes.
