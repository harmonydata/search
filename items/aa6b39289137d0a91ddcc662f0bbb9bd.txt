12:T667,The United Kingdom Study of Abuse and Neglect of Older People, carried out by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) and King’s College London, was commissioned by Comic Relief and the Department of Health. The survey included people aged 66 and over living in private households (including sheltered accommodation). Interviews lasted an average of 50 minutes and were conducted face to face using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), with a self-completion component for the most sensitive questions on sexual abuse.

Respondents from government commissioned health surveys were followed up to obtain large, nationally representative random probability samples. In Wales, no such follow-up sample was available, so a random  probability sample was selected from the comprehensive postcode address file. The overall response rate was 65%.

The aim of the survey was to provide nationally representative prevalence estimates of elder abuse and neglect in the community. Five types of mistreatment were focused on; financial, physical, psychological and sexual abuse, and neglect.
 The research primarily focused on mistreatment which occurred within a relationship where there could reasonably be an expectation of trust – this included family members, close friends, and care workers. However, data was also gathered about mistreatment involving a whole range of perpetrators. As well as collecting information on mistreatment, the questionnaire covered a range of topics about older people's health and wellbeing, for example, social contact, general health, long-term illness, mental health, and economic status.13:T667,The United Kingdom Study of Abuse and Neglect of Older People, carried out by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) and King’s College London, was commissioned by Comic Relief and the Department of Health.
