The most recent part of the study was conducted in 2021 and examined views on Covid-19.

The initial goal was to find the cause of learning disabilities among school children however, the existing dataset contents have been expanded over years to aid research in multiple fields such as health-related studies. The data includes invaluable information about the prevalence of heart disease, pregnancy details, intelligence, schooling, housing, and mental health across the generations.

Back in the 1950&#x27;s, children in Aberdeen primary schools were tested by the University of Aberdeen with the Aberdeen Child Development Survey (ACDS) in maths and reading tests in December 1962. Four decades later, the survey was sent by post to all the now-adult participants with more questions about their personal life, health and living situation to draw correlation between the examined factors. The study yielded 7000 responses and was enriched by consulting the medical records. It has been possible to confirm vital status and place of residence for 98.5% of the 12,150 subjects from which 81% still lived in Scotland and 73% in the Grampian, including Aberdeen. 1431 subjects have been confirmed to be deceased (as at March 2018). 

Linkages to hospital admissions and other health endpoints captured through the routine Scottish Morbidity Records system resulted in links to 41,159 hospital admission records, 1,258 cancer registrations and 1,084 psychiatric admissions (as at March 2008) and include an intergenerational linkage to 7928 deliveries in Scotland occurring to female members of the study population.
