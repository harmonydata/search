12:T654,Qualitative and quantitative data relating to social networks and support received by women from diverse backgrounds during pregnancy and following the birth of their child. Data was collected at two sites from women who experienced an infant death (n=23) and women who had a child over the age of 1 and had felt well supported during the period in question (n=26). Infant mortality among some UK minority ethnic groups and teenage mothers is significantly higher than amongst women in general. This study explores support for maternal and infant health in a range of ethnic and social groups. A new approach will be used to answer the following questions:
(1) What is the nature and extent of social networks for maternal and child health In England and how are these shaped by ethnicity, religious identity, social class and gender?
(2) What interventions to address barriers to maternal and child health are suggested by women who have experienced an infant mortality and how effectively can these be translated into practice?
The study will review current knowledge from existing literature and databases and from policymakers and practitioners. Women from a range of backgrounds in two matched groups will also be interviewed - those who have (i) experienced an infant death (ii) a healthy child after 1 year. Interviews will explore the extent and nature of women's social networks for health and identify gaps in support.
Women interviewed will be supported to develop and test solutions that address the problems identified, using methods that model the structural change needed to reduce inequalities in health.13:T654,Qualitative and quantitative data relating to social networks and support received by women from diverse backgrounds during pregnancy and following the birth of their child.
