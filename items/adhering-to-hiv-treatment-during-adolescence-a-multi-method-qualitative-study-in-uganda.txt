Maintaining adherence to HIV treatment is critical to determining long-term health outcomes, yet presents specific challenges for young people which have yet to be qualitatively studied over time. This is a qualitative study investigating factors mediating adolescents’ adherence to Highly Active Anti-retroviral Therapy (HAART) in Uganda. This study was embedded within a funded, clinical trial to assess the acceptability of Short Cycle Therapy as an intervention to promote optimum adherence amongst young people.

This was of the first qualitative, social science, studies in Uganda to examine young people’s adherence experiences over time. The study is embedded within a ground-breaking international clinical trial, BREATHER, conducted by the Paediatric European Network for the Treatment of AIDS (PENTA) and Medical Research Council (MRC) in 12 countries including the UK, which is testing the efficacy of the short cycle therapy (five days on ART, two days off) as an adherence intervention in 160 young people. The study ran in parallel to a linked qualitative study among YPLHIV in the UK, recently funded by the National Institute of Health Research, and developed by the applicants. The qualitative study added significant value to the trial by examining whether this intervention is acceptable to young people and their carers in facilitating optimum adherence, which will be crucial to assessing whether this intervention can be successfully rolled out in resource-stretched settings, including nationally and regionally. This study provides much needed learning on the specific challenges young people face in adhering to treatment over time during the transition of adolescence. We also explored the varying experiences of this international trial from the perspectives of the young participants and their carers.27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2b"}]
