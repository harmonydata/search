Data collection aimed to unveil the contextual, organisational and behavioural factors explicating the adoption of a more sophisticated costing system and its subsequent effects on non-financial performance. In addition, this data collection aimed also to find out the generative mechanism underneath the correlation between the context and the costing systems. Two methods were used to collect data: survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. We used a systematic random sampling from a population frame of 1000 Congolese enterprises. Participants were firms&#x27; managers with expertise in costing systems. We had a response rate of 20.1%.

In addition, the adequacy of resources emerge as a pattern from the interplay between behaviour and contextual factors, which in return leads to the adoption of cost system sophistication and higher non-financial performance.

In addition, this data collection aimed also to find out the generative mechanism underneath the correlation between the context and the costing systems. Two methods were used to collect data: survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. We used a systematic random sampling from a population frame of 1000 Congolese enterprises. Participants were firms' managers with expertise in costing systems. We had a response rate of 20.1%.
