2c:T11a5,The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys (APMS) (formerly known as the Surveys of Psychiatric Morbidity) are a series of surveys which provide data on the prevalence of both treated and untreated psychiatric disorders in the adult population (aged 16 and over). The first survey was conducted in 1993, covering 16 to 64-year-olds. A further survey was conducted in 2000 (covering 16 to 74-year-olds) and included respondents living in England, Scotland and Wales. From 2007 onwards, the surveys have been commissioned by NHS Digital on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), including people aged over 16 (no upper age limit) living in England. For 2007 and 2014, the surveys were conducted by NatCen Social Research on behalf of NHS Digital. The surveys capture information on common mental disorders, mental health treatment and service use, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorder, autism, personality disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, alcohol, drugs, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, self-harm, and comorbidity.Further information can be found on the NHS Digital Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys webpage.A similar series covering young people aged 5 to 15/16, the Mental Health of Children and Young People Surveys (MHCYP), is also commissioned by NHS Digital.

The specific objectives of the survey were:to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity according to diagnostic category in the adult household population of England. The survey included assessment of common mental disorders; psychosis; borderline and antisocial personality disorder; Asperger syndrome, substance misuse and dependency; and suicidal thoughts, attempts and self-harmto screen for characteristics of eating disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and problem gamblingto examine trends in the psychiatric disorders that have been included in previous survey years (1993 and 2000) to identify the nature and extent of social disadvantage associated with mental illnessto gauge the level and nature of service use in relation to mental health problems, with an emphasis on primary care to collect data on key current and lifetime factors that might be associated with mental health problems, such as experience of stressful life events, abusive relationships, and work stressto collect data on factors that might be protective against poor mental health, such as social support networks and neighbourhood cohesion Further information can be found on the Information Centre for Health and Social Care survey web page.
