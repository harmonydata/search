 The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, 2007 (APMS 2007) is the third survey of psychiatric morbidity in adults living in private households. The main aim of the survey was to collect data on poor mental health among adults aged 16 and over living in private households in England. 

The specific objectives of the survey were:to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity according to diagnostic category in the adult household population of England. The survey included assessment of common mental disorders; psychosis; borderline and antisocial personality disorder; Asperger syndrome, substance misuse and dependency; and suicidal thoughts, attempts and self-harmto screen for characteristics of eating disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and problem gamblingto examine trends in the psychiatric disorders that have been included in previous survey years (1993 and 2000) to identify the nature and extent of social disadvantage associated with mental illnessto gauge the level and nature of service use in relation to mental health problems, with an emphasis on primary care to collect data on key current and lifetime factors that might be associated with mental health problems, such as experience of stressful life events, abusive relationships, and work stressto collect data on factors that might be protective against poor mental health, such as social support networks and neighbourhood cohesion Further information can be found on the Information Centre for Health and Social Care survey web page. 

For the fourth edition (September 2017), three new weighting variables were added to the data, to be used for analysis when combining the 2007 and 2014 APMS datasets (the 2014 survey is not yet available from the UK Data Service). In addition, derived alcohol variables DVAudit1, AUDITgp, SADQCSC, SADQGP, AUDSAD2, AUDSAD3 and DRNKPROB were replaced to correct previous errors. The documentation has also been updated to cover these changes.

A further survey was conducted in 2000 (covering 16 to 74-year-olds) and included respondents living in England, Scotland and Wales. From 2007 onwards, the surveys have been commissioned by NHS Digital on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), including people aged over 16 (no upper age limit) living in England. For 2007 and 2014, the surveys were conducted by NatCen Social Research on behalf of NHS Digital. The surveys capture information on common mental disorders, mental health treatment and service use, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorder, autism, personality disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, alcohol, drugs, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, self-harm, and comorbidity.Further information can be found on the NHS DigitalÂ Adult Psychiatric Morbidity SurveysÂ webpage.A similar series covering young people aged 5 to 15/16, theÂ Mental Health of Children and Young People Surveys (MHCYP), is also commissioned by NHS Digital.Â
