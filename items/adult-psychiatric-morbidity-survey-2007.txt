TICS-m: modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Screening.18:T11a5,The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys (APMS) (formerly known as the Surveys of Psychiatric Morbidity) are a series of surveys which provide data on the prevalence of both treated and untreated psychiatric disorders in the adult population (aged 16 and over). The first survey was conducted in 1993, covering 16 to 64-year-olds. A further survey was conducted in 2000 (covering 16 to 74-year-olds) and included respondents living in England, Scotland and Wales. From 2007 onwards, the surveys have been commissioned by NHS Digital on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), including people aged over 16 (no upper age limit) living in England. For 2007 and 2014, the surveys were conducted by NatCen Social Research on behalf of NHS Digital. The surveys capture information on common mental disorders, mental health treatment and service use, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorder, autism, personality disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, alcohol, drugs, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, self-harm, and comorbidity.Further information can be found on the NHS Digital Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys webpage.A similar series covering young people aged 5 to 15/16, the Mental Health of Children and Young People Surveys (MHCYP), is also commissioned by NHS Digital.
