A further survey was conducted in 2000 (covering 16 to 74-year-olds) and included respondents living in England, Scotland and Wales. From 2007 onwards, the surveys have been commissioned by NHS Digital on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), including people aged over 16 (no upper age limit) living in England. For 2007 and 2014, the surveys were conducted by NatCen Social Research on behalf of NHS Digital. The surveys capture information on common mental disorders, mental health treatment and service use, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorder, autism, personality disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, alcohol, drugs, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, self-harm, and comorbidity.Further information can be found on the NHS Digital Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys webpage.A similar series covering young people aged 5 to 15/16, the Mental Health of Children and Young People Surveys (MHCYP), is also commissioned by NHS Digital. 
 The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, 2014: Special Licence Access (APMS 2014) is the fourth survey of psychiatric morbidity in adults living in private households. It was carried out by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen Social Research) in collaboration with the University of Leicester, and was commissioned by NHS Digital. Users should note that the 2014 survey is subject to more restrictive Special Licence access conditions than previous surveys in the series.  

The main aim of the survey series is to collect data on poor mental health among adults (aged 16 and over) living in private households in England. The specific objectives are:to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity according to diagnostic category in the adult household population of England. The survey includes assessment of common mental disorders, psychosis, autism, substance misuse and dependency, and suicidal thoughts, attempts and self-harm;to screen for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder and personality disorders;to examine trends in the psychiatric disorders included in previous survey years (1993, 2000, and 2007).to identify the nature and extent of social disadvantage associated with mental illness;.to gauge the level and nature of treatment and service use in relation to mental health problems, with an emphasis on primary care;to collect data on key current and lifetime factors that might be associated with mental health problems, such as the experience of stressful life events, abusive relationships, and work stress.to collect data on factors that might protect against poor mental health, such as social support networks and neighbourhood cohesion.Further information about APMS 2014 may be found on the NHS Digital Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey: Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, England, 2014 webpage.New edition informationFor the second edition (August 2019), labels for variables VfamCX1 ,Va, Va12 and Va12f were corrected and the dataset documentation updated accordingly.

Morbidity Surveys (APMS) (formerly known as the Surveys of Psychiatric Morbidity) are a series of surveys which provide data on the prevalence of both treated and untreated psychiatric disorders in the adult population (aged 16 and over). The first survey was conducted in 1993, covering 16 to 64-year-olds. A further survey was conducted in 2000 (covering 16 to 74-year-olds) and included respondents living in England, Scotland and Wales. From 2007 onwards, the surveys have been commissioned by NHS Digital on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), including people aged over 16 (no upper age limit) living in England. For 2007 and 2014, the surveys were conducted by NatCen Social Research on behalf of NHS Digital. The surveys capture information on common mental disorders, mental health treatment and service use, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorder, autism, personality disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, alcohol, drugs, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, self-harm, and comorbidity.Further information can be found on the NHS Digital Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys webpage.A similar series covering young people aged 5 to 15/16, the Mental Health of Children and Young People Surveys (MHCYP), is also commissioned by NHS Digital. \\n The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, 2014: Special Licence Access (APMS 2014) is the fourth survey of psychiatric morbidity in adults living in private households. It was carried out by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen Social Research) in collaboration with the University of Leicester, and was commissioned by NHS Digital. Users should note that the 2014 survey is subject to more restrictive Special Licence access conditions than previous surveys in the series.  \\n\\nThe main aim of the survey series is to collect data on poor mental health among adults (aged 16 and over) living in private households in England. The specific objectives are:to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity according to diagnostic category in the adult household population of England. The survey includes assessment of common mental disorders, psychosis, autism, substance misuse and dependency, and suicidal thoughts, attempts and self-harm;to screen for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder and personality disorders;to examine trends in the psychiatric disorders included in previous survey years (1993, 2000, and 2007).to identify the nature and extent of social disadvantage associated with mental illness;.to gauge the level and nature of treatment and service use in relation to mental health problems, with an emphasis on primary care;to collect data on key current and lifetime factors that might be associated with mental health problems, such as the experience of stressful life events, abusive relationships, and work stress.to collect data on factors that might protect against poor mental health, such as social support networks and neighbourhood cohesion.Further information about APMS 2014 may be found on the NHS Digital Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey: Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, England, 2014 webpage.New edition informationFor the second edition (August 2019), labels for variables VfamCX1 ,Va, Va12 and Va12f were corrected and the dataset documentation updated accordingly.\\n\\nSpecial access conditions\\nUsers should note that access to this study requires adherence to special conditions.
