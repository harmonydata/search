The final question in this section asks for the manager's conjectured advertising response to a series of hypothetical questions concerning trading conditions and rival companies. 
All respondents were asked to complete section three (q.13 to q.17) entitled 'About Your Company'. Here managers were  asked to categorise their main product line or service within a particular sector of the economy and to list the geographical market at which their main product line is aimed. They are also asked to rank the most important modes of competition for their main product line and to identify the number of competitors for this product. Following this section managers are asked (q.18) to provide data on total advertising expenditure for up to ten financial years.27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2b"}]
