The third wave of EHIS took place in 2019 and 2020 and was completed by all member sates in accordance with the European Parliament and Council regulation. The UK was required to complete EHIS Wave 3 as the UK was a member state in 2019.  Users should note that the United Kingdom opted out of the first wave and did not take part, so UK EHIS data exists only from Wave 2 and Wave 3. This dataset contains only the UK responses.Further information about the survey may be found on the European Commission \nEuropean Health Interview Survey webpage.Latest edition informationFor the second edition (March 2022), data and documentation for Wave 3 were added to the study.\n Demographics, health status, diseases and chronic conditions, accidents and injuries, absence from work (due to health problems), physical and sensory functional limitations, personal care activities, household activities, pain, mental health, health care, use of inpatient and day care, use of ambulatory and home care, medicine use, preventive services, unmet needs for health care, health determinants, weight and height, banded Body Mass Index (BMI), physical activity/exercise, consumption of fruit and vegetables, smoking, alcohol consumption, social support, provision of informal care or assistance.e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"European Health Interview Survey: United Kingdom Data, Wave 2 and 3, 2013-2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$12\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"European Health Interview Survey: United Kingdom Data, Wave 2 and 3, 2013-2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"$13\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/ae7877f8d7eb08874c148bb0019bfce4\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:sit"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e_name\",\"content\":\"Academic Resource Discovery\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:locale\",\"content\":\"en_US\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:image:width\",\"content\":\"1200\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:image:height\",\"content\":\"630\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"og:image:alt\",\"content\":\"European Health Interview Survey: United Kingdom Data, Wave 2 and 3, 2013-2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"website\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary_large_image\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"European Health Interview Survey: United Kingdom Data, Wave 2 and 3, 2013-2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$14\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"17\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]]\nc:null\n"])</script></body></html>
