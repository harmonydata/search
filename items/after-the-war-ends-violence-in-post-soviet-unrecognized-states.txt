It hones in on post-war developments in so-called de facto, or unrecognized, states. The survey deposited here took place in Nagorno Karabakh in September 2013. Nagorno Karabakh is officially part of Azerbaijan, but it has functioned as a de facto state since the war with its “parent” state Azerbaijan in 1988-1993. The survey, which covers 1,000 respondents over the age of 18, asks people questions about their views on their present political, social, economic, and security situation, as well as their experiences of violence in the war of 1988-1993. The survey respondents were selected randomly from eight primary sampling units (the capital and the seven regions controlled by the Nagorno Karabakh authorities). Participation was entirely voluntary, and the survey responses are anonymous. The survey questions were asked in the respondents’ native tongue, by professionally trained interviewers. The survey was designed by the Dr. Bakke, based on surveys carried out elsewhere, and was commissioned to be carried out in the field by the Armenian Sociological Association.What happens after the fighting in intrastate conflicts officially ends? Peace settlements and military victories are assumed to bring an end to violence, yet they are often followed by high levels of crime and fighting among former enemies, even among former allies.\n\nQuestions about post-war violence are particularly important in so-called de facto states born out of violent struggles, as these are vulnerable entities in the international system from the very outset. De facto, or unrecognized, states lack international recognition but function as state-like entities in that they control the population within their territories.
