British Cohort Study (BCS70)","description":"The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) follows the lives of more than 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1970.\n\nThe study covers various aspects of life, including health; physical, cognitive and social development; parenting; career paths; and economic circumstances. It also collects this information from a variety of sources, including clinical records, medical examinations, nutrition and activity diaries, parents, teachers and cohort members themselves.\n\nFindings from the study have been used to understand some of the most persistent challenges facing UK society, and have been a vital source of evidence on key policy areas such as social mobility, education, training and employment and economic insecurity. \n\nStudy website: www.cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1970-british-cohort-study","url":["","https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1970-british-cohort-study/","https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1970-british-cohort-study/)","https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.cls.bcs70/75fe4705-0c94-4f75-b1e6-ad9c61ffde26","https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=BCS70","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=BCS"],"keywords":["Reproductive health","Education","Social care - need","Political and social attitudes","Sleep problems","Social care - provision","Parenting and family","Biomarkers","Migration and immigration","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Social care - receipt","Cognitive measures","Language and literacy","Physical health assessment","Puberty","Neighbourhood","Housing","Sexuality and gender identity","Victimisation and life events","Work and employment","Covid-19 data collection","Diet and nutrition"],"identifier":["https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jhealeco.2009.10.003","https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyl174","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-016-0767-z"],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"CLOSER Discovery","url":"https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.cls.bcs70/75fe4705-0c94-4f75-b1e6-ad9c61ffde26","image":"https://closer.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/closer-2022/www/images/closer-logo-full.svg"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies","url":"https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration: UK LLC","url":"https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=BCS70","image":"https://ukllc.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/ukllc-theme/assets/images/UKLLC_Logo_Landscape_Black.svg"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=BCS","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"}],"publisher":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Centre for Longitudinal Studies, UCL Institute of Education"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) - Institute of Education (IoE), UCL"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Professor George Ploubidis"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"UCL"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) - Institute of Education (IoE), UCL"}],"funder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Economic and Social Research Council"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"ESRC RCOG\nNational Birthday Trust Fund"}],"copyrightHolder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"UCL"}],"license":["https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/series/series?id=200001","https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/data-access-training/access-ukds/"],"image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/BCS.png","size":"18460"},"extra_data":{"instruments":[],"study_design":[],"source":["hdruk","closer","ukds","cls","ukllc","mhc"],"name":"1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70)","country_codes":["GB"],"resource_type":"study","keywords":["Reproductive health","Education","Social care - need","Political and social attitudes","Sleep problems","Social care - provision","Parenting and family","Biomarkers","Migration and immigration","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Social care - receipt","Cognitive measures","Language and literacy","Physical health assessment","Puberty","Neighbourhood","Housing","Sexuality and gender identity","Victimisation and life events","Work and employment","Covid-19 data collection","Diet and nutrition"],"uuid":"492057ed65e8bc0e7cada6297729b277","number_of_variables":41686},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]}]}}]]}]
