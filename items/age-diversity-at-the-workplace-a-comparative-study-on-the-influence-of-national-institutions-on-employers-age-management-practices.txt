The study used four matched pairs of German and British organisations in the education sector, chemical sector (engineering), the steel sector and the retail sector. Two datasets were compiled.\n\nThe first dataset includes a panel event and semi-structured face-to-face/telephone interviews with experts. 19 Interviews were conducted with those considered to be national stake holders and experts on age management and age diversity (11 in Germany and 8 in Britain). Interviews were also conducted with representatives of the government, employer and employee associations NGOs and with research institutes and universities working in this area. There was also a panel discussion held with 5 panel members (1 German and 4 British) in February 2009, which focused on the effects of the economic downturn on age management policies and practices in both countries.\n\nFor the second dataset, semi-structured interviews were conducted with Human Resources Managers, Line Managers and Employee Representatives in the case study organisations of the previously mentioned sectors. Where possible, additional semi-structured interviews were conducted with members of employee and employer representative organisations in the specific sector. Focus groups were also held and transcribed with older workers, aged 50 years and older, working in the relevant occupations in the case study organisations.These focus groups were homogeneous in their setup and allowed participants to discuss their understanding of their organisation’s age diversity policy, its implementation and relevance with peers in a “protected environment”. These interviews and focus groups were audio taped and transcribed. German interviews were not translated into the English language due to restricted resources. The management of an ageing workforce will be one of the most important human resource (HR) challenges of the next decades. The European Union has set ambitious targets for increase in older people’s participation in the workforce which can only be realised if employers are encouraged to make work more attractive to older people by offering flexibility, training, and rewarding jobs which contribute to self-worth Progress in achieving an age positive approach to HRM varies by sector, but skills shortages and pension demands are persuading many employers of the benefits of encouraging delayed retirement. \nThis one year study will explore age diversity practices of two matched case study pairs of British and German organisations. The research will focus on the role of industrial relation institutions in implementing age management policies, and a comparison will be made of case studies operating under the German social model and British voluntarist industrial relations regimes.

2e:Tcdb,This research aimed to explore differences and similarities in how organisations in two distinct business systems - Britain and Germany - deal with the challenge of an ageing workforce. The study used four matched pairs of German and British organisations in the education sector, chemical sector (engineering), the steel sector and the retail sector. Two datasets were compiled.

The first dataset includes a panel event and semi-structured face-to-face/telephone interviews with experts. 19 Interviews were conducted with those considered to be national stake holders and experts on age management and age diversity (11 in Germany and 8 in Britain). Interviews were also conducted with representatives of the government, employer and employee associations NGOs and with research institutes and universities working in this area. There was also a panel discussion held with 5 panel members (1 German and 4 British) in February 2009, which focused on the effects of the economic downturn on age management policies and practices in both countries.

For the second dataset, semi-structured interviews were conducted with Human Resources Managers, Line Managers and Employee Representatives in the case study organisations of the previously mentioned sectors. Where possible, additional semi-structured interviews were conducted with members of employee and employer representative organisations in the specific sector. Focus groups were also held and transcribed with older workers, aged 50 years and older, working in the relevant occupations in the case study organisations.These focus groups were homogeneous in their setup and allowed participants to discuss their understanding of their organisation’s age diversity policy, its implementation and relevance with peers in a “protected environment”. These interviews and focus groups were audio taped and transcribed. German interviews were not translated into the English language due to restricted resources. The management of an ageing workforce will be one of the most important human resource (HR) challenges of the next decades. The European Union has set ambitious targets for increase in older people’s participation in the workforce which can only be realised if employers are encouraged to make work more attractive to older people by offering flexibility, training, and rewarding jobs which contribute to self-worth Progress in achieving an age positive approach to HRM varies by sector, but skills shortages and pension demands are persuading many employers of the benefits of encouraging delayed retirement. 
This one year study will explore age diversity practices of two matched case study pairs of British and German organisations. The research will focus on the role of industrial relation institutions in implementing age management policies, and a comparison will be made of case studies operating under the German social model and British voluntarist industrial relations regimes. The research will focus on occupations where there are significant skill shortages, and will draw case studies from both the private and public sectors. In-depth semi-structured interviews will be held with managers and employee representatives, and focus groups will be conducted with employees from selected occupational groups.29:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2e"}]
