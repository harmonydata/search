Participants also reported the perceived personal distance between themselves, their best friend, and a stranger. We demonstrate that compared to young participants, older adults showed an increased bias toward matching their friends over strangers, whereas the bias toward the self over friends tended to decrease in the perceptual matching task. Equivalent results occurred for a perceived personal distance and on measures of perceptual sensitivity with older adults; the personal distance between friends and strangers correlated with the friend bias in matching.
