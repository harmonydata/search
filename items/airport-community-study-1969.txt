2d:Te08,A survey sponsored by the Commission on London's Third Airport to ascertain the social, housing and economic background of residents of the four proposed airport sites and their attitudes towards present area and possibility of siting the airport within their area.  Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
Attitudinal information towards London third airport siting includes: an open ended question - 'How do you feel towards the possibility of having a third London airport here?'. Whether respondent would be in favour or opposed to having airport there and attitudes towards having to move because of airport are assessed on fixed scales. If respondent (or head of household) had the choice of a job in present area and a job outside that area, which he would choose is given as well as whether respondent had considered moving in the year before the airport was suggested, and whether respondent had made specific plans to move.
Attitudes towards area: what most liked about living in present parish (10 categories e.g. peaceful/quiet, like the village, near job etc.), also whether anything disliked about parish (open ended). Data include: length of residency in present parish (including whether born there), reason for first moving to present abode (12 categories - e.g. because of job, to be near relatives etc.), place of previous residence (in relation to parish now lived in).
Social information: relatives seen most often and frequency of meeting, a record of the number of friends and relatives living within the parish, on the airport site or within a 10 mile radius. Those with children under 16 years are asked to give: age of child, type of school attended (i.e. nursery/play group, primary, secondary or not at school) and where school is situated in relation to parish. Housewives are asked where they do the bulk of their food shopping. All respondents are asked whether they visit public houses and, if so, whether they visit one in particular (name and place is recorded), also noted are the name and place of church or chapel if attended. More specifically, informants are asked whether they went out last Saturday evening, if so where they went.
