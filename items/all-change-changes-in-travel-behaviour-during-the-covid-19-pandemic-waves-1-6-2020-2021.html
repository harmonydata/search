The research programme was designed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to measure and explore the reasons for current and intended changes in travel behaviour amongst the British public.Fieldwork for the first wave took place in May/June 2020 while the sixth and final wave took place in November 2021. All survey interviews were conducted online withadults aged 16-75 years old across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The data are longitudinal; however, they include additional fresh samples at each wave. The data are provided here in a single dataset file covering all six waves.Respondents at waves 2-6 were drawn from those that had taken part in previous waves and agreed to be recontacted. While wave 2 involved &#x27;top-up&#x27; sampling to boost the overall sample to approximately 4,000, this was not the case at wave 3 when the sample was drawn exclusively from the longitudinal cohort and contained no &#x27;fresh&#x27; samples. At wave 4, a targeted &#x27;top-up&#x27; exercise was undertaken to bolster the numbers among a selection of groups and geographies available for recontact at wave 5 (this reached 564 respondents). Waves 5 and 6 also involved a full &#x27;top-up&#x27; exercise to secure samples of over 4,000.At each wave, the survey questionnaire was translated into the Welsh language with respondents in Wales given the choice of whether to complete the survey in Welsh or in English.Further information and reports are available on the GOV.UK web site. The All Change survey included the following main topics, although not all topics were covered in all waves:transport behaviour (including mode and frequency of travel as well as journey purposes)expectations of future journeysreasons for changing travel behaviourtravel perceptions (including level of comfort when travelling, safety, COVID precautions)travel to work and for shoppingsustainable travelvaccination"/><meta property="og:title" content="All Change?

All survey interviews were conducted online withadults aged 16-75 years old across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The data are longitudinal; however, they include additional fresh samples at each wave. The data are provided here in a single dataset file covering all six waves.Respondents at waves 2-6 were drawn from those that had taken part in previous waves and agreed to be recontacted. While wave 2 involved 'top-up' sampling to boost the overall sample to approximately 4,000, this was not the case at wave 3 when the sample was drawn exclusively from the longitudinal cohort and contained no 'fresh' samples. At wave 4, a targeted 'top-up' exercise was undertaken to bolster the numbers among a selection of groups and geographies available for recontact at wave 5 (this reached 564 respondents).
