Our research consists of a literature review that examines the most common fraud theories and attempts to interpret the characteristics of human behaviour that lead to fraud as well as current methods of detecting corporate fraud. Methods: We searched the Scopus database for articles on fraud theory. We analyse articles published between 2004 and 2022, using a keyword search for ‘Fraud Triangle’, ‘Fraud Diamond’, ‘Fraud Pentagon’, and ‘Fraud Hexagon’.

Results: According to our network analysis, the Fraud Diamond theory seems to be the most functional fraud theory. According to our findings of the published articles, the main human behavioural characteristics that can lead a manager to commit fraud are the components of the fraud diamond theory: capability - opportunity - pressure - rationalization. Thus, the fraud diamond theory analyses more than the fraud triangle, pentagon, and hexagon theories. So human behavioural characteristics have a positive effect and can lead to fraud in companies.
