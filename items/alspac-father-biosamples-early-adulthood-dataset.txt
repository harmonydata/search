Between April 1991 and December 1992 more than 14,000 pregnant women were recruited into the study and these women (some of whom had two pregnancies or multiple births during the recruitment period), the children arising from the pregnancy, and their partners have been followed up intensively over two decades.\n\nStudy website: https://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/","url":["","http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/)","https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.alspac/c6601e78-0f74-446a-a5f1-7c73a1984b4e","https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=ALSPAC","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=ALSPAC"],"keywords":["Victimisation and life events","Social care - provision","Digital technology and social media","Social care - receipt","Social care - need","Parenting and family","Cognitive measures","Sexuality and gender identity","Housing","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Covid-19 data collection","Reproductive health","Language and literacy","Neighbourhood","Puberty","Diet and nutrition","Loneliness and social isolation","Work and employment","Biomarkers","Sleep problems","Education","Physical health assessment","Ethnicity and race","Political and social attitudes"],"identifier":["https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dys064","https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dys066","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15132.1","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16950.1"],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"CLOSER Discovery","url":"https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.alspac/c6601e78-0f74-446a-a5f1-7c73a1984b4e","image":"https://closer.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/closer-2022/www/images/closer-logo-full.svg"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration: UK LLC","url":"https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=ALSPAC","image":"https://ukllc.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/ukllc-theme/assets/images/UKLLC_Logo_Landscape_Black.svg"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=ALSPAC","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"}],"publisher":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Professor George Davy Smith, Professor Nic Timpson"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol "},{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol"}],"funder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Medical Research Council"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Wellcome Trust"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"MRC Wellcome BristolUni"}],"copyrightHolder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol "}],"license":["http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/access/"],"image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/ALSPAC.png","size":"19982"},"extra_data":{"study_design":[],"name":"Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents & Children (ALSPAC)","source":["closer","mhc","ukllc","ukds"],"resource_type":"study","instruments":[],"country_codes":["GB"],"keywords":["Victimisation and life events","Social care - provision","Digital technology and social media","Social care - receipt","Social care - need","Parenting and family","Cognitive measures","Sexuality and gender identity","Housing","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Covid-19 data collection","Reproductive health","Language and literacy","Neighbourhood","Puberty","Diet and nutrition","Loneliness and social isolation","Work and employment","Biomarkers","Sleep problems","Education","Physical health assessment","Ethnicity and race","Political and social attitudes"],"uuid":"1bcff6f4d91dc98f895f10c377fb1b8d","number_of_variables":62381},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]}]}}]]
