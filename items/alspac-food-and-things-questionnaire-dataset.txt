Between April 1991 and December 1992 more than 14,000 pregnant women were recruited into the study and these women (some of whom had two pregnancies or multiple births during the recruitment period), the children arising from the pregnancy, and their partners have been followed up intensively over two decades.\n\nStudy website: https://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/","url":["","http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/)","https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.alspac/c6601e78-0f74-446a-a5f1-7c73a1984b4e","https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=ALSPAC","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=ALSPAC"],"keywords":["Education","Social care - receipt","Physical health assessment","Sexuality and gender identity","Cognitive measures","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Reproductive health","Biomarkers","Political and social attitudes","Social care - provision","Puberty","Ethnicity and race","Parenting and family","Language and literacy","Digital technology and social media","Neighbourhood","Housing","Victimisation and life events","Diet and nutrition","Social care - need","Covid-19 data collection","Loneliness and social isolation","Work and employment","Sleep problems"],"identifier":["https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dys064","https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dys066","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15132.1","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16950.1"],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"CLOSER Discovery","url":"https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.alspac/c6601e78-0f74-446a-a5f1-7c73a1984b4e","image":"https://closer.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/closer-2022/www/images/closer-logo-full.svg"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration: UK LLC","url":"https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=ALSPAC","image":"https://ukllc.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/ukllc-theme/assets/images/UKLLC_Logo_Landscape_Black.svg"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=ALSPAC","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"}],"publisher":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Professor George Davy Smith, Professor Nic Timpson"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol "},{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol"}],"funder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Medical Research Council"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Wellcome Trust"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"MRC Wellcome BristolUni"}],"copyrightHolder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol "}],"license":["http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/access/"],"image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/ALSPAC.png","size":"19982"},"extra_data":{"source":["closer","mhc","ukllc","ukds"],"country_codes":["GB"],"keywords":["Education","Social care - receipt","Physical health assessment","Sexuality and gender identity","Cognitive measures","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Reproductive health","Biomarkers","Political and social attitudes","Social care - provision","Puberty","Ethnicity and race","Parenting and family","Language and literacy","Digital technology and social media","Neighbourhood","Housing","Victimisation and life events","Diet and nutrition","Social care - need","Covid-19 data collection","Loneliness and social isolation","Work and employment","Sleep problems"],"resource_type":"study","name":"Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents & Children (ALSPAC)","instruments":[],"study_design":[],"uuid":"1bcff6f4d91dc98f895f10c377fb1b8d","number_of_variables":62381},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]}]}}]]}]
