investigating influences on health and development across the life course. It considers multiple genetic, epigenetic, biological, psychological, social and other environmental exposures in relation to a similarly diverse range of health, social and developmental outcomes.\\n\\nBased at the University of Bristol, the ALSPAC is a world-leading birth cohort study. Between April 1991 and December 1992 more than 14,000 pregnant women were recruited into the study and these women (some of whom had two pregnancies or multiple births during the recruitment period), the children arising from the pregnancy, and their partners have been followed up intensively over two decades.\\n\\nStudy website: https://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/\",\"url\":[\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/\",\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/)\",\"https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.alspac/c6601e78-0f74-446a-a5f1-7c73a1984b4e\",\"https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=ALSPAC\",\"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study\u0026studyid=ALSPAC\"],\"keywords\":[\"Cognitive measures\",\"Victimisation and life events\",\"Social care -
