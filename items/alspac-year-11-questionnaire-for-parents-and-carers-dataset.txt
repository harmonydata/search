Between April 1991 and December 1992 more than 14,000 pregnant women were recruited into the study and these women (some of whom had two pregnancies or multiple births during the recruitment period), the children arising from the pregnancy, and their partners have been followed up intensively over two decades.\n\nStudy website: https://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/","url":["","http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/)","https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.alspac/c6601e78-0f74-446a-a5f1-7c73a1984b4e","https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=ALSPAC","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=ALSPAC"],"keywords":["Reproductive health","Education","Social care - need","Ethnicity and race","Political and social attitudes","Sleep problems","Loneliness and social isolation","Social care - provision","Parenting and family","Biomarkers","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Social care - receipt","Cognitive measures","Language and literacy","Physical health assessment","Digital technology and social media","Puberty","Neighbourhood","Housing","Sexuality and gender identity","Victimisation and life events","Work and employment","Covid-19 data collection","Diet and nutrition"],"identifier":["https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dys064","https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dys066","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15132.1","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16950.1"],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"CLOSER Discovery","url":"https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.alspac/c6601e78-0f74-446a-a5f1-7c73a1984b4e","image":"https://closer.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/closer-2022/www/images/closer-logo-full.svg"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration: UK LLC","url":"https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=ALSPAC","image":"https://ukllc.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/ukllc-theme/assets/images/UKLLC_Logo_Landscape_Black.svg"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=ALSPAC","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"}],"publisher":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Professor George Davy Smith, Professor Nic Timpson"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol "},{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol"}],"funder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Medical Research Council"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Wellcome Trust"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"MRC Wellcome BristolUni"}],"copyrightHolder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol "}],"license":["http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/access/"],"image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/ALSPAC.png","size":"19982"},"extra_data":{"instruments":[],"source":["closer","ukllc","mhc","ukds"],"name":"Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents & Children (ALSPAC)","study_design":[],"country_codes":["GB"],"resource_type":"study","keywords":["Reproductive health","Education","Social care - need","Ethnicity and race","Political and social attitudes","Sleep problems","Loneliness and social isolation","Social care - provision","Parenting and family","Biomarkers","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Social care - receipt","Cognitive measures","Language and literacy","Physical health assessment","Digital technology and social media","Puberty","Neighbourhood","Housing","Sexuality and gender identity","Victimisation and life events","Work and employment","Covid-19 data collection","Diet and nutrition"],"uuid":"1bcff6f4d91dc98f895f10c377fb1b8d","number_of_variables":67311},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]}]}}]]}]
