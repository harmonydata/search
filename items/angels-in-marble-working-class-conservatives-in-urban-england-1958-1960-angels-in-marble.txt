The fourth and final phase involved the re-interviewing of eight working class Conservatives in 1963 about their reactions to the Profumo affair. The interviewees in this phase had already been interviewed twice previously in the earlier phases. This enabled the researchers to create a case study from the fourth-phase interviews, a specific event which threw the Conservative leadership into question. Phase four and the quantitative data are not held at the UK Data Archive.27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2b"}]
