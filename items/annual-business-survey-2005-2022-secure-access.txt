The indicators in the ABS publications are collected and presented as monetary values or counts, for example, approximate Gross Value Added (aGVA), numbers of enterprises. They are essentially a snapshot of UK business activity, and can be used to understand the level of the contributions to the UK economy from different sectors of the economy at any one time.

The ABS replaced the Annual Business Inquiry, Part 2 (ABI/2) in 2009, although ABS data are available for 2008.  The BRES replaced the Annual Business Inquiry, Part 1 (ABI/1) in 2009.  The BRES data for 2009 onwards are held separately under UK Data Archive SN 7463.  ABI/1 and ABI/2 data  for 2008 and earlier are held under UK Data Archive SN 6644, Annual Respondents Database: Secure Access (ARD).  Researchers who are applying for access to the ABS and who also require data prior to 2008 are recommended to also apply for the ARD data under SN 6644.
