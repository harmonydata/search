2a:T9c6,The Annual Respondents Database X (ARDx) has been created to allow users of Annual Respondents Database (ARD) (held at the UK Data Archive under SN 6644) to continue analysis even though the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI) which was used to create ARD ceased in 2008. ARDx contains harmonised variables from 1997 to 2020.
ARDx is created from two ONS surveys, the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI; 1998-2008, held at the UK Data Archive under SN 6644) and the Annual Business Survey (ABS; 2009 onwards, held at the UK Data Archive under SN 7451). The ABI has an employment survey (ABI1) and a second survey for financial information (ABI2). ABS only collects financial data, and so is supplemented with employment data from the Business Register and Employment Survey (BRES; 2009 onwards, held at the UK Data Archive under SN 7463).

ARDx consists of six types of files: 'respondent files' which have reported and derived information from survey questionnaire responses; and 'universe files' which contain limited information on all business that are within scope of the ABI/ABS. These files are provided at both the Reporting Unit and Local Unit levels. There are also 'register panel' and "capital stock" files.

Linking to other business studies
These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) reference numbers. These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together. Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research.

For the fifth edition (December 2023), ARDx Version 4.0 for 1997-2020 has been provided, replacing Version 3. Coverage has thus been expanded to include 1997 and 2015-2020.

Note to users
Due to the limited nature of the documentation available for ARDx, users are advised to consult the documentation for the Annual Business Survey (UK Data Archive SN 7451) for detailed information about the data.
For Secure Lab 
projects applying for access to this study as well as to SN 6697 
Business Structure Database and/or SN 7683 Business Structure Database Longitudinal, only postcode-free versions of the data 
will be made available. The variables included in ARDx are of two different types:IDBR-based information about the local unit or reporting unit, such as ownership, type of business, employment or turnover from tax records, and weightsrespondent data, indicated by 'wq' followed by a question number e.g. wq10026:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2a"}]
