the absence of a leniency program, complying with the Beckerian Proposition,
detection rates and fines are indeed substitutable. In the presence of a leniency
program, however, a regime that embodies low rates of detection and high fines
reduces the propensity to collude and lowers the overall incidence of cartelized
markets significantly more than a high detection and low fine regime. This indicates
that antitrust agencies can economize on enforcement costs and achieve a higher
degree of deterrence by imposing higher level of fines.The ESRC Centre for Competition Policy (CCP) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) undertakes interdisciplinary research into competition policy and regulation that has real-world policy relevance without compromising academic rigour.

It prides itself on the interdisciplinary nature of the research and the members are drawn from a range of disciplines, including economics, law, business and political science.

The Centre was established in September 2004, building on the pre-existing Centre for Competition and Regulation (CCR), with a grant from the ESRC (Economic and Social Research Council). It currently boasts a total of 26 faculty members (including the Director and a Political Science Mentor), 4 full- and part-time researchers and 23 PhD students.27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2b"}]
