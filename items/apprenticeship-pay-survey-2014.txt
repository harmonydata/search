As well as separate minimum rates for those aged under 18, 18-20 and 21 or over, there is a distinct National Minimum Wage rate for apprentices aged 16 to 18 and those aged 19 or over who are in their first year of the Apprenticeship (all other apprentices are entitled to the National Minimum Wage for their age). At the time the survey was conducted The National Minimum Wage rate per hour for apprentices was £2.68 for those aged 16-18 or in the first year of their Apprenticeship, £5.03 for those in their second year or later and aged 19-20, and £6.31 for those in their second year or later and aged 21 and over.

The main aim of this survey was to provide an accurate and up-to-date picture of the pay of the apprentice population, both across Great Britain, and within England, Scotland and Wales, in order to assist with development and monitoring of Apprenticeship and National Minimum Wage policy. For example, evidence from the Apprenticeship Pay Survey contributes to the Low Pay Commission’s recommendations to Government for the Apprenticeship minimum wage rate.

The Apprenticeship Pay Survey was also conducted in 2005, 2007, 2011 and 2012, but only data from 2014 onwards are available from the UK Data Service. The 2016 survey is held under SN 8204, which also includes a combined 2014 and 2016 file.
