The data was generated using a bespoke mobile phone app based field survey tool to generate key information on a range of farm variables including farm characteristics and practices; procurement of seed; water management; stocking practices and densities; inputs and treatments; disease incidence; harvest and economic performance.  A key initial framing question for the survey and sampling strategy was the extent to which PL source (wild, untested hatchery, PCR tested, SPF) made a difference to production, disease burden, and profits.\nThe survey was developed by the research team, translated into Bangla (Bengali) and piloted on 20 farms of varying characteristics. In the field, it was administered by the team with NGO assistance, using five infopedlars, an employment scheme that offered work experience opportunities to female students and young women in Bangladesh. ARBAN (Activity for Reformation of Basic Needs - a development NGO) and the research team trained the infopedlars in survey delivery and software application as well as farming and disease issues. Farms were randomly selected from a pre-existing census, with some sample refinement to allow for field logistics. Global stewardship of existing antibiotics within livestock systems is a key component of any attempt to manage the incidence and transmission of emergent and resistant bacteria, resistance conferring genes and mobile elements. Yet, global demand for animal derived protein is fuelling investment in and intensification of livestock systems with resulting increases in use of veterinary medicines. These systems have until now relied on medicinal and other inputs as infrastructure that permits increased stocking densities and livestock throughput, while reducing morbidity and mortality. In this sense, antibiotics have become a key component of livestock agriculture. Decoupling agriculture from the risks of generating greater antimicrobial resistance is a key challenge addressed in this project.\nThis project focuses on the growing and under-regulated aquaculture (fish and shell fish production) sector within Asia, which is intensifying to meet domestic demand for animal derived protein and worldwide export markets. We aim to to assess the growing use of antibiotics within this important sector of global food production, and experiment with farm based medicine stewardship strategies that promote sustainable and appropriate use. The project has implications for food security, food safety, human and environmental (aquatic) health as well as the livelihoods of millions of people.\nThe rapidly growing and intensifying global aquaculture industry (the so-called blue revolution) is known to be a major user of antimicrobials and a key gateway for antimicrobial resistance. Reducing or preventing the escalation of non-therapeutic and unnecessary uses of antibiotics requires social innovations that address path dependencies and the socio-economics of livestock production. \nDetailed knowledge on the uses and socio-economic drivers of antimicrobial inputs in aquaculture is required in order to \n1) Minimise the potential risks of aquaculture expansion for human and environmental health.\n2) Develop strategies that allow for the prudent use of compounds, particularly where they increase risks of the emergence and transmission of antimicrobial resistance.\nIn this pump-priming project we seek to investigate variability in use of antibiotics and AMR-related inputs within aquaculture, and devise a strategy that encourages appropriate and alternative animal health treatments. We focus on the effective stewardship of antibiotics within the rapidly growing, poorly regulated and heterogeneous shrimp and prawn sectors in Bangladesh.\nThe project involves development of a partnership between UK and Bangladeshi expertise, and involves social scientists, biologists, aquaculture and rural development experts in order to understand the drivers of antibiotic uses and to cooperatively develop with farmers interventions for developing more appropriate treatments and disease abatement strategies. The project will survey shrimp and prawn farmers and hatcheries to develop clear understanding of the relationship between farm inputs, farm sizes and value chain characteristics.

The data was generated using a bespoke mobile phone app based field survey tool to generate key information on a range of farm variables including farm characteristics and practices; procurement of seed; water management; stocking practices and densities; inputs and treatments; disease incidence; harvest and economic performance.  A key initial framing question for the survey and sampling strategy was the extent to which PL source (wild, untested hatchery, PCR tested, SPF) made a difference to production, disease burden, and profits.
The survey was developed by the research team, translated into Bangla (Bengali) and piloted on 20 farms of varying characteristics. In the field, it was administered by the team with NGO assistance, using five infopedlars, an employment scheme that offered work experience opportunities to female students and young women in Bangladesh. ARBAN (Activity for Reformation of Basic Needs - a development NGO) and the research team trained the infopedlars in survey delivery and software application as well as farming and disease issues. Farms were randomly selected from a pre-existing census, with some sample refinement to allow for field logistics. Global stewardship of existing antibiotics within livestock systems is a key component of any attempt to manage the incidence and transmission of emergent and resistant bacteria, resistance conferring genes and mobile elements. Yet, global demand for animal derived protein is fuelling investment in and intensification of livestock systems with resulting increases in use of veterinary medicines. These systems have until now relied on medicinal and other inputs as infrastructure that permits increased stocking densities and livestock throughput, while reducing morbidity and mortality. In this sense, antibiotics have become a key component of livestock agriculture. Decoupling agriculture from the risks of generating greater antimicrobial resistance is a key challenge addressed in this project.
This project focuses on the growing and under-regulated aquaculture (fish and shell fish production) sector within Asia, which is intensifying to meet domestic demand for animal derived protein and worldwide export markets. We aim to to assess the growing use of antibiotics within this important sector of global food production, and experiment with farm based medicine stewardship strategies that promote sustainable and appropriate use. The project has implications for food security, food safety, human and environmental (aquatic) health as well as the livelihoods of millions of people.
The rapidly growing and intensifying global aquaculture industry (the so-called blue revolution) is known to be a major user of antimicrobials and a key gateway for antimicrobial resistance. Reducing or preventing the escalation of non-therapeutic and unnecessary uses of antibiotics requires social innovations that address path dependencies and the socio-economics of livestock production. 
Detailed knowledge on the uses and socio-economic drivers of antimicrobial inputs in aquaculture is required in order to 
1) Minimise the potential risks of aquaculture expansion for human and environmental health.
2) Develop strategies that allow for the prudent use of compounds, particularly where they increase risks of the emergence and transmission of antimicrobial resistance.
In this pump-priming project we seek to investigate variability in use of antibiotics and AMR-related inputs within aquaculture, and devise a strategy that encourages appropriate and alternative animal health treatments. We focus on the effective stewardship of antibiotics within the rapidly growing, poorly regulated and heterogeneous shrimp and prawn sectors in Bangladesh.
The project involves development of a partnership between UK and Bangladeshi expertise, and involves social scientists, biologists, aquaculture and rural development experts in order to understand the drivers of antibiotic uses and to cooperatively develop with farmers interventions for developing more appropriate treatments and disease abatement strategies. The project will survey shrimp and prawn farmers and hatcheries to develop clear understanding of the relationship between farm inputs, farm sizes and value chain characteristics. This information will be augmented with more detailed interview data with farmers, farm suppliers (those who sell antibiotics and other inputs), market intermediaries, depots and other key actors.1d:["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:description","content":"$2c"}]
