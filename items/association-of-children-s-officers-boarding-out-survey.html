Information is given on the process of placing the child in the foster home. Details include: child&#x27;s natural parent(s)&#x27; attitudes, foster parent(s)&#x27; attitudes, whether the child had prior knowledge of this placing, the child&#x27;s &#x27;in-care&#x27; history, criteria affecting choice of foster homes and the Child Care Officer&#x27;s attitude to the placing.
The following data are recorded during the child&#x27;s period of residence in the foster home: change in foster family circumstances not resulting in the removal of the child (e.g. death of foster parent, removal, birth of a child etc.), symptoms of emotional disturbance in the child (15 categories, as previously recorded), whether the child has resumed contact with the natural parents in any way. Also, foster parent(s)&#x27; motive for fostering the child is restated as apparent to the supervising Child Care Officer.
The following data are recorded after the child&#x27;s removal from the foster home. If child is discharged from care: date of, and reason for, discharge (10 categories), whether the child remained in the foster home on reaching the age of 18. If removed from the foster home for reason other than discharge from care: date, factors contributing to or resulting in removal (27 categories), whether the stated were mere excuses on the part of the foster parent(s) to terminate agreement, whether removal was arranged at insistence of the child, the foster parent(s) or the Child Care Officer. Finally a tally is given of the number of Child Care Officers who have supervised the child during his stay at the foster home.
Background Variables
Child: date of birth, religion, age on reception into care, date of placing, reason for acceptance into care, period of care and former placings, degree of contact with parents before this placing, separation from brothers and sisters, degree of mental capacity (i.e. I.Q. rating), symptoms of emotional disturbance immediately before placing (e.g. wetting, thumb-sucking etc. - 15 categories), general behaviour (i.e. good, average, poor). Foster parent(s): marital status, health, motive for fostering - as stated by foster parent(s). Also, a record is made of any other children in the foster home."/><meta property="og:title" content="Association of Children&#x27;s Officers Boarding-Out Survey"/><meta property="og:description" content="To keep a record of children in foster homes during a two year period, including history, behaviour and eventual disposition of each child.
