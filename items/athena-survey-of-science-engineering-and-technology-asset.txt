We find evidence that female scientists in the UK face glass ceilings both in terms of pay and promotion. Not only do women earn less because they are less likely to be promoted, they are also likely to earn less when they are employed within the same grades. Interestingly, the point at which women hit the glass ceiling depends upon institutions.  In Universities the glass ceiling is thickest at the point of promotion from senior lecturer to professor, a typical glass ceiling, whereas in Research Institutes women seem to face disadvantage in obtaining promotion from scientist (post-doc) to senior scientist, perhaps better described as a sticky floor.  In both cases, these are the most demanding promotions but ceteris paribus they are significantly more demanding for women.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Athena survey of science engineering and Technology (ASSET)"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Athena survey of science engineering and Technology (ASSET)"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/athena-survey-of-science-engineering-and-technology-asset"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Athena survey of science engineering and Technology (ASSET)"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Athena survey of science engineering and Technology (ASSET)"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
