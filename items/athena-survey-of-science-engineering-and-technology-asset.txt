Interestingly, the point at which women hit the glass ceiling depends upon institutions.  In Universities the glass ceiling is thickest at the point of promotion from senior lecturer to professor, a typical glass ceiling, whereas in Research Institutes women seem to face disadvantage in obtaining promotion from scientist (post-doc) to senior scientist, perhaps better described as a sticky floor.  In both cases, these are the most demanding promotions but ceteris paribus they are significantly more demanding for women.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Athena survey of science engineering and Technology (ASSET)"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Athena survey of science engineering and Technology (ASSET)"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/athena-survey-of-science-engineering-and-technology-asset"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Athena survey of science engineering and Technology (ASSET)"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Athena survey of science engineering and Technology (ASSET)"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
