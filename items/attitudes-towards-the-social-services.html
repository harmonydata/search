Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
This very detailed study is divided into sections on the social services in general, the National Health Service, Children&#x27;s Services, Housing, Education and other social benefits. The National Health Service: an overall assessment of the service, respondent&#x27;s help-seeking behaviour, treatment and satisfaction, use of specialist services, assessment of hospital and personnel as patient and/or visitor (including view of &#x27;immigrant&#x27; doctors and nurses), and use of and opinion of private insurance schemes.
The Children&#x27;s Services: maternity benefits, place of delivery, services used and satisfaction vis-a-vis youngest child, family allowance receipt, use and satisfaction, use of family planning clinics and satisfaction, and an open-ended question asking for suggestions for new services.
Housing: the nature of the respondent&#x27;s accommodation, payment arrangements, satisfaction with present home, experience of council housing, private landlords, and opinions about council housing and other forms of housing subsidies.
Education: the respondent is asked to rate the state education system, provide information on state services utilized (nursery schools, meals, milk, transport and use of higher educational institutions including adult evening classes), state the number, sex and age of children at what type of school, rate those schools on dimensions of basic training, enrichment education, personal development training, physical conditions, size of class, quality of meals and disciplinary approach. A separate section deals with progress of up to three selected children. All informants, whether they have children or not, describe educational practice and facilities in their area, and give their opinion of these services.
Other social benefits treated are sickness benefits, supplementary benefit/national assistance, death grants, unemployment benefits, widows&#x27; benefits and retirement/old age pensions. Opinions and satisfaction with these benefits are solicited, as well as experiences during the help-seeking period.
Background Variables
Terminal education age, political allegiance and 1966 General Election vote, consumer goods ownership, age, household status, marital status, work status, occupation of informant and of head of household and relationship between same, income, social &#x27;grade&#x27; and composition of household. There is also a question asking about use of voluntary associations/services."/><meta property="og:title" content="Attitudes towards the Social Services"/><meta property="og:description" content="To ascertain what people think about the various social services provided by the Government and local authorities, the degree of awareness of the different social services, extent of use and satisfaction.
