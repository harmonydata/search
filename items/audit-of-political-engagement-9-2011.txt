Each Audit report presents the findings from a public opinion survey, providing detailed commentary on a range of measures that have been chosen as key measures of political engagement.

Given the multi-dimensional nature of political engagement, the indicators chosen are not exhaustive, but in capturing aspects of public behaviour, knowledge, opinions, attitudes and values towards politics they help us understand the drivers of political engagement and the relationships between them. Across the Audit series several 'core' indicator questions have been asked each year, supplemented by a range of thematic and topical questions, some of which are re-visited on two- or three-year cycles.\n\nFurther information about the survey series is available from the Hansard Society Audit of Political Engagement webpages.\n\n The Audit of Political Engagement 9, 2011 provides an update of the six core indicators. A year ago, Audit 8 reflected on a growing sense of indifference to politics. The greater levels of interest in and perceived knowledge of politics in an election year had not been matched by greater satisfaction with, or a greater engagement in, the political process beyond a slight increase in turnout itself. The 2011 Audit suggests that indifference has hardened into something more significant, and disturbing.

In addition to the quantitative survey, the 2011 Audit drew on the findings of 14 focus groups held across the country between November 2011 and March 2012, which explored public attitudes to politics and the democratic process. These are available from the UK Data Archive under SN 7855 - Anti-Politics: Characterising and Accounting for Political Disaffection, 2011-2012.

 Topics covered in 2011 included: political engagement indicators; Parliament, MPs and constitutional matters; civic engagement, local participation and the 'Big Society'; politics and the media; two political models: 'sunshine democracy' and 'stealth democracy' (see the paper referenced in the Abstract section); and demographics.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Audit of Political Engagement 9, 2011"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Audit of Political Engagement 9, 2011"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/audit-of-political-engagement-9-2011"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Audit of Political Engagement 9, 2011"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Audit of Political Engagement 9, 2011"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
