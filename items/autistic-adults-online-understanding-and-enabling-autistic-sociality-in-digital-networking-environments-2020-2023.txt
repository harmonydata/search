Most autism research, technology design, and service provision has focused on children and adults who cannot live independently, with little attention to how adults can be supported to succeed in work and social participation.

Such understanding is crucial for moving autism support beyond individualized, behaviour-based interventions and towards community and network-centred approaches.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Autistic Adults Online: Understanding and Enabling Autistic Sociality in Digital Networking Environments, 2020-2023"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Autistic Adults Online: Understanding and Enabling Autistic Sociality in Digital Networking Environments, 2020-2023"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/autistic-adults-online-understanding-and-enabling-autistic-sociality-in-digital-networking-environments-2020-2023"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Autistic Adults Online: Understanding and Enabling Autistic Sociality in Digital Networking Environments, 2020-2023"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Autistic Adults Online: Understanding and Enabling Autistic Sociality in Digital Networking Environments, 2020-2023"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
