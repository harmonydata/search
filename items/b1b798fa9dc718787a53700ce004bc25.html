An additional grant from the Constitution Unit, University College, London, enabled the addition of a module of questions on proportional representation, which built on similar questions asked on the Welsh Assembly Election Study 1999 (SN:4180).
 The dataset contains the replies of 988 respondents in Wales to questions on media consumption, party identification, voting in the Welsh National Assembly election, proportional representation, leadership evaluations, retrospective evaluations, political issues, political trust, national identity, constitutional issues, effectiveness of devolved institutions, Welsh language and party images. Classificatory information was also collected on national identity, origin and Welsh speaking, sex and age, religion, marital status, housing, economic activity and job details, and income.
