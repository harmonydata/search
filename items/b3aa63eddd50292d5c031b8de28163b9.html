The survey is commissioned by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in partnership with three of its non-departmental public bodies (Sport England, Arts Council England and English Heritage). The survey was first commissioned in 2005 as a face-to-face household survey of adults (16+) in England. Since then it has run annually and has also been developed to include further elements, including a child element and a longitudinal element.

Further information can be found on the Gov.uk Taking Part web pages.

Taking Part, 2007-2008 also known as Year 3 of the continuous survey includes 25,720  interviews conducted with adults (aged 16 or over) and 885 interviews conducted with children (aged 11-15).

The survey used face-to-face computer assisted personal interviews, which take 45 minutes, on average, to complete. The sample for this survey has been randomly selected from the small-users postcode address file and only those from private households in England are included. No geographical restrictions are placed on the location of the engagement, although it must have been for the purpose of recreation or leisure, including voluntary work. Taking Part excludes involvement in sectors where the prime motivation is paid work or academic study. The exceptions to this are attendance at historic environment sites which included visits made for academic study and sports opportunities which excludes refereeing, officiating and coaching.

For the second edition (September 2010), the child data and documentation were added to the study. In addition, the adult documentation has been updated and four variables have been removed from the adult data: area, key, sqmls and sqkms.

A Special Licence (SL) access version of this study is held under SN 7342, which contains additional detailed geographic variables (Local Authorities; ACORN Group; ACORN Category; ONS Urban Rural Classification). Users are advised to first obtain the standard EUL version (this study, SN 6273) to see if they are sufficient for their research requirements, as the SL data have more restrictive access conditions.

 Main topics covered by the survey include: the arts, museums and galleries, libraries, archives, heritage, sport, social capital, engagement in various sectors whilst growing up, volunteering, broadcasting, gambling, the Olympics, licensing laws, and demographics."/><meta property="og:title" content="Taking Part: the National Survey of Culture, Leisure and Sport, 2007-2008; Adult and Child Data"/><meta property="og:description" content="The Taking Part survey collects data on many aspects of leisure, culture and sport in England, as well as an in-depth range of socio-demographic information on respondents.

The survey is commissioned by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in partnership with three of its non-departmental public bodies (Sport England, Arts Council England and English Heritage). The survey was first commissioned in 2005 as a face-to-face household survey of adults (16+) in England. Since then it has run annually and has also been developed to include further elements, including a child element and a longitudinal element.\n\nFurther information can be found on the Gov.uk Taking Part web pages.\n\nTaking Part, 2007-2008 also known as Year 3 of the continuous survey includes 25,720  interviews conducted with adults (aged 16 or over) and 885 interviews conducted with children (aged 11-15).\n\nThe survey used face-to-face computer assisted personal interviews, which take 45 minutes, on average, to complete. The sample for this survey has been randomly selected from the small-users postcode address file and only those from private households in England are included. No geographical restrictions are placed on the location of the engagement, although it must have been for the purpose of recreation or leisure, including voluntary work. Taking Part excludes involvement in sectors where the prime motivation is paid work or academic study. The exceptions to this are attendance at historic environment sites which included visits made for academic study and sports opportunities which excludes refereeing, officiating and coaching.\n\nFor the second edition (September 2010), the child data and documentation were added to the study. In addition, the adult documentation has been updated and four variables have been removed from the adult data: area, key, sqmls and sqkms.\n\nA Special Licence (SL) access version of this study is held under SN 7342, which contains additional detailed geographic variables (Local Authorities; ACORN Group; ACORN Category; ONS Urban Rural Classification). Users are advised to first obtain the standard EUL version (this study, SN 6273) to see if they are sufficient for their research requirements, as the SL data have more restrictive access conditions.\n\n Main topics covered by the survey include: the arts, museums and galleries, libraries, archives, heritage, sport, social capital, engagement in various sectors whilst growing up, volunteering, broadcasting, gambling, the Olympics, licensing laws, and demographics."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"14:Ta03,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"The Taking Part survey collects data on many aspects of leisure, culture and sport in England, as well as an in-depth range of socio-demographic information on respondents.
