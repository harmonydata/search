Users should also note that there is a duplicate ID number in the dataset (case 154), though the cases do seem to be different. Due to the age of the data, users should analyse it with caution.  Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions:
Opinion on problems in Switzerland, satisfaction with present situation compared to 5 years ago. Satisfaction with housing conditions, family income, employment, opportunities for children, Swiss government. Expectation of change in living standards over next 3 or 4 years. Whether political commentary read in newspapers/listened to on radio. Interest in politics (international, federal, state, communal), assessment of interest of Berne federal/cantonal authorities in own problems. Action would take if communal authorities behaved unjustly, assessment of personal efficacy, experience of action. Knowledge of parties in Federal Council at Berne. Country&#x27;s most important political goal. Opinion on: best method of social change/order; civil disobedience; student demonstrations; use of violence against government; police intervention at demonstrations. Best solution to: inflation; entry of foreign workers; housing problem. Party preference. Opinion on: entry of Switzerland into EEC; military service/conscientious objectors; role of women in politics; equity of income distribution; prohibition of Jesuit Order. Likelihood of an economic crisis occuring in next 10 years. Frequency of political discussion with family/friends and coincidence of views, reaction to political conversations, frequency of requests for political information. Subjective regional affinity, rating of different cultural groups (e.g. Italians, German-speaking Swiss, Catholics). Which groups represent respondent&#x27;s interests (trade unions, professional organisations, political parties, elected representatives) and perceived degree of efficacy. Attitudes to political parties and politics in general. Frequency and consistency of vote in communal/cantonal/federal elections and attendance at political meetings prior to elections, deciding factor on vote. Spouse&#x27;s voting behaviour, opinion on reasons for low turnout for referendums and on initiatives. Assessment of various political parties&#x27; positions and own position on left-right political spectrum.
Most important differences between left and right wing parties. Vote in previous year&#x27;s referendum on feminine suffrage. Degree of confidence in government allowing individual freedom. Opinion on relative importance of National Council and Council of States, whether National deputies should take decisions in accordance with their parties, the voters or their own judgement. Most important source of political information, frequency of watching news/political programmes on television. Opinion on difference between religious issues and political parties, strength of religious feeling. Subjective social class, frequency of visits to German-speaking Switzerland and Tessin, attachment to present residence, comparison of father&#x27;s position with own.
