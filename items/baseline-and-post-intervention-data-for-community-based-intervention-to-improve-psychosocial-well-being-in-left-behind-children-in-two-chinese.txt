Questionnaires were distributed by researchers in the classroom setting in villages and townships.  Data were collected in early  2015 in Zhejiang and late  2015 in Guizhou. Data include left behind children (LBC, living with neither parent), Single Children (SC, children living with one parent) and Rural Children (RC, children living with both parents). Data includes sociodemographic, economic, psychosocial, emotional and behavioural variables. The psychosocial and emotional variables draw on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. There are data for 3796 children in total: 1560(41%) in Zhejiang and 2236 (59%) in Guizhou; 1553 (41%) living with neither parent, 868 (23%) SC living with one parent, and 1378 (36%) living with both parents. \n2)\tPost-intervention data for children in Zhejiang (n=335) who had attended the centres at least 30% of the time over a one year period and controls (n=100) matched by village.

Over the period April 2016 to September 2018 centres were organised  in 20 villages in  both provinces by local volunteers and local college students.  They  provided age-appropriate activities, including educational support,  sport activities, arts and crafts.  and help with communication with parents. While originally planned to focus on left behind children, all children aged 5 to 16 were welcomed at the Centres.

Data includes sociodemographic, economic, psychosocial, emotional and behavioural variables. Data collection took place in 2018. 
4)	Post-intervention interview recordings with children who attended the centres (in Chinese). 
5)	Interviews with parents of attending children (in Chinese).In China an estimated 58 million children, or 28% of all rural children, have been left behind in rural areas by parents migrating to cities to work. It is already established that prolonged separation disrupts parent-child relationships and leads to increased psychosocial difficulties, behavioural problems and poorer educational attainment.  
In collaboration with the Chinese Women’s Federation and local government, we developed a network of forty Children's Centres in five counties in two provinces, Zhejiang and Guizhou, representing rich and poor Chinese provinces. The counties are all known migrant-sending areas of the two provinces, with large numbers of children left behind. Over the period April 2016 to September 2018 centres were organised  in 20 villages in  both provinces by local volunteers and local college students.  They  provided age-appropriate activities, including educational support,  sport activities, arts and crafts.  and help with communication with parents. While originally planned to focus on left behind children, all children aged 5 to 16 were welcomed at the Centres. Our model, allowing local communities to adapt the programme theory to specific local community contexts, is highly innovative in the Chinese setting. 
Well-being surveys of children were conducted at baseline and post-intervention, allowing for comparison of children who attended the Centres and those who did not. 
Results showed that the Centres established a community care platform and support network, which benefited the emotional and behavioural well-being of both children left behind (by one or both parents), and those living with both parents. Children who regularly attended the centres for at least one year (n=719) showed significant improvements in emotional well-being, social support, less risk behaviour,  compared with non-attending children.  Baseline and post-intervention follow-up of the children  also showed  that psychosocial wellbeing was negatively impacted by economic hardship, and in situations where the main caregiver is an elderly grandparent.  
The social impact of Centres was considerable, with over half explicitly recognised as a community asset, a place of safety for children, and a focal point in the village.  The Centres demonstrate an inexpensive, feasible and evidence-based model to address the effects of migration on children in rural communities. They continue to the present in villages in two counties with local government support.17:T1145,The data collection provides baseline and post-intervention data for a community-based  intervention aiming to improve psychosocial outcomes in rural children. 
The collection comprises the following:
1)	Baseline data for children aged 8 to 15 in 20 villages in 3 counties in Zhejiang Province in Eastern China, and in 20 villages in 2 counties in Guizhou Province in south-western China. Questionnaires were distributed by researchers in the classroom setting in villages and townships.  Data were collected in early  2015 in Zhejiang and late  2015 in Guizhou. Data include left behind children (LBC, living with neither parent), Single Children (SC, children living with one parent) and Rural Children (RC, children living with both parents). Data includes sociodemographic, economic, psychosocial, emotional and behavioural variables. The psychosocial and emotional variables draw on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. There are data for 3796 children in total: 1560(41%) in Zhejiang and 2236 (59%) in Guizhou; 1553 (41%) living with neither parent, 868 (23%) SC living with one parent, and 1378 (36%) living with both parents. 
2)	Post-intervention data for children in Zhejiang (n=335) who had attended the centres at least 30% of the time over a one year period and controls (n=100) matched by village.  Data includes sociodemographic, economic, psychosocial, emotional and behavioural variables. Data collection took place in early 2017. 
3)	Post-intervention data for children in Guizhou (n=474) who had attended the centres at least 30% of the time over a one year period. and controls (n=100) matched by village. Data includes sociodemographic, economic, psychosocial, emotional and behavioural variables. Data collection took place in 2018.
