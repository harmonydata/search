12:Tbec,In 2000, the Government launched the Work-Life Balance Campaign, targeting employers to promote the benefits of flexible working for all employees. Although this campaign was not specifically aimed at parents or carers, the legislation restricted rights to apply for changes in the hours, timing or place of work to those employees with caring responsibilities. 

The then Department for Education and Employment (later the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) and now the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS)) carried out the first Work-Life Balance Survey (WLB1) in 2000 (held at the UK Data Archive under SN 4465). It was used to assess how far employers operated work-life balance practices and whether employees felt that existing practices met their needs. The first survey was followed up in 2003 by a second survey, a two-part survey of employees and employers (WLB2) (held under SNs 5079 and 5080) and by a third wave in 2006 and 2007 (WLB3) (held under SNs 7028 and 5787). The fourth employee survey was carried out in 2011 (held under SN 7112) and the fourth employers survey was completed in 2013 (held under SN 7775).

 The aims of the second Work-Life Balance Study were two-fold: 
firstly, to monitor change since the 2000 Work-Life Balance baseline study (held under SN 4465) by collecting data on (a) employer provision of work-life balance practices and policies, (b) employee take-up of, and demand for, these initiatives, and (c) the impact of employers’ provisions (including costs and benefits);
secondly, to establish a robust baseline for future evaluation of the provisions brought in under the Employment Act 2002.

The findings of the research will be used to track changes since the first study and assess the impact of new legislation governing leave entitlements and employers’ flexible working practices on different cross-sections of the population.

The employees' survey objectives included: 
assessing employees’ awareness of the current statutory leave entitlements, including maternity leave, parental leave, and time off for dependents, as well as forthcoming new rights;
assessing take-up of work-life balance practices including reasons for non take-up (e.g. impact on job security and promotion); 
ascertaining the demand for work-life balance practices;
establishing the extent to which work-life balance practices meet employee needs, including views on the feasibility of employers extending these arrangements; and
ascertaining employees’ views on the impact of work-life balance practices.

The Employers' Survey is held under SN 5080.
 The dataset contains the responses of employees to questions which were based on meeting the aims of the research, covering the following topics:
demographics
details of individuals' employment
hours of work
work-life balance practices and policies
maternity leave arrangements
paternity leave arrangements
emergency time off for dependants
parental leave arrangements
annual leave arrangements
