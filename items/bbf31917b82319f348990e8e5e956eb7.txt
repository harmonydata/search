12:T585,This dataset is part of a larger research project that the Chalmers University of Technology conducts in east Africa with respect to solar PV powered mini-grids, rural electrification, and its impact on sustainable development goals. The aim of the data collection was thus to gather relevant social, economic, electrification, geographic, demographic and energy use data in order to investigate the impact of solar mini-grids on the economic development, income generation and biomass fuel consumption of rural off-grid households in two remote towns in Ethiopia. Since, the data analysis approach to be used was initially determined to be Propensity Score Method (PSM), the data collection was made in two separate groups: Intervention (mini-grid electrified) groups, and control (non-electrified) groups.As part of efforts to increase access to electricity and promote socio-economic development in rural areas, many sub-Saharan African countries are deploying decentralized solar mini-grids. However, little empirical research has been done to examine the impact of these technologies. Using propensity score matching, this paper examines the effects of rural electrification through distributed solar mini-grids on household income, wood-fuels use and kerosene expenditures. Data were collected from a survey of 464 sample households (212 electrified and 252 non-electrified) in two remote towns in Ethiopia.13:T585,This dataset is part of a larger research project that the Chalmers University of Technology conducts in east Africa with respect to solar PV powered mini-grids, rural electrification, and its impact on sustainable development goals.
