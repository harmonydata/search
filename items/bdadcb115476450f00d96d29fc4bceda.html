Results from national surveys can also not be reliably compared due to differences in question formulation and survey methodology. Furthermore, some EU Member States have not carried out national surveys on violence against women, or the available data is old.\n\nThe FRA survey is based on face-to-face interviews with 42,000 women across the EU, who were selected based on random sampling. They were asked about their experiences of physical, sexual and psychological violence, including incidents of intimate partner violence ('domestic violence'). The survey also included questions on stalking, sexual harassment, experiences of violence in childhood by adult perpetrators, safety and fear of crime, as well as awareness of laws and support services. While all respondents were asked about experiencing various forms of violence in order to establish the prevalence of violence, women who had been victims of violence were asked further details about the nature and consequences of the incidents. These data can be analysed both at the EU-level and at the Member State level to assess and to develop policies to combat violence against women.\n\nFurther information and publications can be found on the FRA website. \n\n The main topics include: violence against women; intimate partner violence; non-partner violence; physical violence; sexual violence; psychological violence; stalking; domestic violence; feelings of safety; fear of crime; sexual harassment; experience of violence in childhood; rights awareness; consequences of violence; prevalence of violence; victimisation."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights: Violence Against Women Survey, 2012\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$12\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights: Violence Against Women Survey, 2012\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"$13\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/bdadcb115476450f00d96d29fc4bceda\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:site_name\",\"content\":\"Academic Resource Discovery\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:locale\",\"content\":\"en_US\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:image:width\",\"content\":\"1200\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:image:height\",\"content\":\"630\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"og:image:alt\",\"content\":\"European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights: Violence Against Women Survey, 2012\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"website\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary_large_image\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights: Violence Against Women Survey, 2012\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$14\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"17\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]]\nc:null\n"])</script></body></html>
