12:Tb0f,The Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) and the MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing (LHA) have carried out two online surveys of the participants of five national longitudinal cohort studies which have collected insights into the lives of study participants including their physical and mental health and wellbeing, family and relationships, education, work, and finances during the coronavirus pandemic. The Wave 1 Survey was carried out at the height of lockdown restrictions in May 2020 and focussed mainly on how participantsâ€™ lives had changed from just before the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 until then. The Wave 2 survey was conducted in September/October 2020 and focussed on the period between the easing of restrictions in June through the summer into the autumn. A third wave of the survey was conducted in early 2021.In addition, CLS study members who had participated in any of the three COVID-19 Surveys were invited to provide a finger-prick blood sample to be analysed for COVID-19 antibodies. Those who agreed were sent a blood sample collection kit and were asked to post back the sample to a laboratory for analysis. The antibody test results and initial short survey responses are included in a single dataset, the COVID-19 Antibody Testing in the National Child Development Study, 1970 British Cohort Study, Next Steps and Millennium Cohort Study, 2021 (SN 8823).The CLS studies are:Millennium Cohort Study (born 2000-02) both cohort members and parents (MCS)Next Steps (born 1989-90) (NS)1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70)1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS).The LHA study is:MRC National Survey of Health and Development, 1946 British birth cohort (NSHD)The content of the MCS, NS, BCS70 and NCDS COVID-19 studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website.Â 
TheÂ COVID-19 Survey in Five National Longitudinal Cohort Studies: Millennium Cohort Study, Next Steps, 1970 British Cohort Study and 1958 National Child Development Study, 2020-2021Â contains the data from waves 1, 2 and 3 for the 4 cohort studies. The data from all four CLS cohorts are included in the same dataset, one for each wave.The COVID-19 Survey data for the 1946 birth cohort study (NSHD) run by the LHA is held under

and available under Special Licence access conditions.Latest edition informationFor the fourth edition (June 2022), the following minor corrections have been made to the wave 3 data:corrections to a small number of cases where CW3_GROW and CW3_GROWB were incorrectly calculatedrecoded values and reformatted the code list for CW3_COVIDVAC as the original value of 3 was removed from the final version of the survey
