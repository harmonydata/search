Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to think about what others see, know, think, want and intend, and is thought to be a fundamental basis of social interaction and communication.

ToM has been widely studied in young children and infants, and more recently its cognitive and neural basis has begun to be studied in adults. The main paradigm for this work requires participants to follow instructions from a speaker who does not fully share their visual perspective on the scene under discussion. Critical instructions have different meanings depending on whether or not participants successfully take the speaker's perspective into account. Previous work by the applicants, their collaborator at the University of Chicago, and others, shows that adults frequently show errors when following such instructions, and such difficulty is also observed in more sensitive measures, based on participants' eye movements during the tasks. By adapting these tasks, the new findings will provide insights about: (1) the extent and limits of adults' abilities to use their ToM;  (2) how these limits vary between cultures (Western versus Chinese); (3) how they change through children's development into adults; (4) whether people who are good at ToM-use have generally better social abilities.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Behavioural and eyetracking data using the Director task"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$15"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Behavioural and eyetracking data using the Director task"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/behavioural-and-eyetracking-data-using-the-director-task"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Behavioural and eyetracking data using the Director task"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Behavioural and eyetracking data using the Director task"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
