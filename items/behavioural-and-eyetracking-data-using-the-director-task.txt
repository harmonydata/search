Part 3: linguistic complexity manipulation with a developmental sample (in press in JECP). Part 4: cross-cultural similarities and differences between English and Taiwanese participants (including an adapted version of the director task with an informed and an ignorant director and a perspective-switching component between these directors). This study also included a level-1 visual perspective-taking task (Samson, Apperly, et al., 2010). We were able to measure altercentric interference, which is spontaneous accounting of other’s perspective, on both tasks. Part 5: memory factor in perspective-taking (there was an additional memory demand on the director task along with systematic variation of the relative magnitude of common ground versus privileged ground between 3 and 9 items. OSPAN was carried out as a working memory measure).

Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to think about what others see, know, think, want and intend, and is thought to be a fundamental basis of social interaction and communication.

ToM has been widely studied in young children and infants, and more recently its cognitive and neural basis has begun to be studied in adults. The main paradigm for this work requires participants to follow instructions from a speaker who does not fully share their visual perspective on the scene under discussion. Critical instructions have different meanings depending on whether or not participants successfully take the speaker's perspective into account. Previous work by the applicants, their collaborator at the University of Chicago, and others, shows that adults frequently show errors when following such instructions, and such difficulty is also observed in more sensitive measures, based on participants' eye movements during the tasks. By adapting these tasks, the new findings will provide insights about: (1) the extent and limits of adults' abilities to use their ToM;  (2) how these limits vary between cultures (Western versus Chinese); (3) how they change through children's development into adults; (4) whether people who are good at ToM-use have generally better social abilities.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Behavioural and eyetracking data using the Director task"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Behavioural and eyetracking data using the Director task"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/behavioural-and-eyetracking-data-using-the-director-task"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Behavioural and eyetracking data using the Director task"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Behavioural and eyetracking data using the Director task"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
