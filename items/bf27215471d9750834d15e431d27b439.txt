12:T8c8,The purpose of this study was to provide data about the population of Banbury and district, in addition to the Census data, for a study of social relations in Banbury and as a supplement to the interactional data which was collected by observation and interview.  Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
Occupational data include: detailed occupational designation (including industry type and full job description), working status (i.e. full-time, part-time etc.), length of time in present job, whether earns wage/salary/fees/profit, record of approximate net income received, together with the title of respondent's first job. In the same section, respondents are asked to state father's occupation and whether he was pursuing this at the time of the respondent's marriage.
Information also includes a list of affiliations to clubs, societies, organizations etc., together with religious denominations and a record of respondent's voting behaviour in the last general election (1966).
Married, widowed, separated, divorced female respondents are also asked to give the above information on behalf of their husbands.
Background Variables
Place of birth (i.e. whether born or brought up in Banbury area - if not, when came to Banbury), age when left school, whether received fee-paying education or had any full-time higher education, whether respondent's children have ever received fee-paying education and, if already left school, at what age and whether had any full-time higher education. Type of dwelling (11 categories), rateable value of property, type of tenure (7 categories), household composition (including: number, sex, ages, marital status and relationship to respondent, together with a record of any others living in house). The head of household is identified. Family record includes: respondent's marital status (including length of present marriage and a record of previous marriages), number and ages of children, and finally, whether respondent's parents (or parents-in-law) are still alive, if so, when respondent last saw them.
A set of exercise notes for this survey has been deposited by Sara Arber, Dept of Sociology, Univ of Surrey. These are concerned with the elaboration of a bivariate relationship using SPSS.
