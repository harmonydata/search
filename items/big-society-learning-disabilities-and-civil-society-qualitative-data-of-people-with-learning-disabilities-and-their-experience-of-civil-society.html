Learning disabilities and civil society. Qualitative data of people with learning disabilities and their experience of civil society</title><meta name="description" content="Research objectives were tackling though the following AIMS of our empirical work: 
Data was collected to meet the empirical objectives of the research:

1. To conduct key stakeholder interviews with representatives of disabled people&#x27;s organisations; disability lawyers; policy makers; campaign groups to assess their perspectives on the Big Society and civil society for disabled people; 
2. To implement a literature review and a longitudinal documentary analysis of coalition government policy and legislation related to learning disabilities and disability with particular emphasis on the Big Society agenda and the work of the Office for Civil Society; 
3. To conduct an ethnographic case study of three civil society partners&#x27; practices including Circles of Support; Real Employment and Speak up Self-advocacy. 
4. As part of the ethnography, to work with our civil society partners as co-researchers, drawing on their expertise and experience to capture their civil society practices in the context of the Big Society 

Following ongoing checking of informed consent, dialogue and consistent meetings with co-researchers with intellectual disabilities and civil society partners they sanctioned limited data to be deposited. This fits with:

1. The original ethical plans of the ESRC bid
2. Agreement (or not) to share their data with the Data archive as detailed in the information sheet and consent forms shared with co-researchers and civil society partners.
The aim of this timely and exciting project is to explore the opportunities for disabled people with learning disabilities (LD) to contribute to and benefit from Big Society.

The research team, from The University of Sheffield, Manchester Metropolitan University, Northumbria University and The University of Bristol, will be working with organisations of/for disabled people, activists and allies to discover how disabled people with LD are participating in their communities, in public services and in social action.

The team will explore disabled people with LD’s access to social capital and networks of interdependence as well as their social emotional well-being in a context of austerity. The research will be carried out over two years through four phases: (1)an extended literature review and policy analysis; (2) interviews with key stakeholders; (3)a period of ethnographic research working with circles of support, real employment and self-advocacy organisations; and (4) a ‘researcher in residence’ phase in which a university researcher will work alongside third sector organisations in order to promote knowledge exchange and impact generation.

Dissemination and impact will be supported by the impact champions sitting on the research management group and through a series of public policy-round tables."/><meta property="og:title" content="Big society?
