The aim of this timely and exciting project is to explore the opportunities for disabled people with learning disabilities (LD) to contribute to and benefit from Big Society.

The research team, from The University of Sheffield, Manchester Metropolitan University, Northumbria University and The University of Bristol, will be working with organisations of/for disabled people, activists and allies to discover how disabled people with LD are participating in their communities, in public services and in social action.

The team will explore disabled people with LD’s access to social capital and networks of interdependence as well as their social emotional well-being in a context of austerity. The research will be carried out over two years through four phases: (1)an extended literature review and policy analysis; (2) interviews with key stakeholders; (3)a period of ethnographic research working with circles of support, real employment and self-advocacy organisations; and (4) a ‘researcher in residence’ phase in which a university researcher will work alongside third sector organisations in order to promote knowledge exchange and impact generation.

Dissemination and impact will be supported by the impact champions sitting on the research management group and through a series of public policy-round tables.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Big society?
