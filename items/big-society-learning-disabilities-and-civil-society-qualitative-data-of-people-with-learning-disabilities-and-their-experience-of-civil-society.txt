4. As part of the ethnography, to work with our civil society partners as co-researchers, drawing on their expertise and experience to capture their civil society practices in the context of the Big Society 

Following ongoing checking of informed consent, dialogue and consistent meetings with co-researchers with intellectual disabilities and civil society partners they sanctioned limited data to be deposited. This fits with:

1. The original ethical plans of the ESRC bid
2. Agreement (or not) to share their data with the Data archive as detailed in the information sheet and consent forms shared with co-researchers and civil society partners.
The aim of this timely and exciting project is to explore the opportunities for disabled people with learning disabilities (LD) to contribute to and benefit from Big Society.

The research team, from The University of Sheffield, Manchester Metropolitan University, Northumbria University and The University of Bristol, will be working with organisations of/for disabled people, activists and allies to discover how disabled people with LD are participating in their communities, in public services and in social action.

The team will explore disabled people with LD’s access to social capital and networks of interdependence as well as their social emotional well-being in a context of austerity. The research will be carried out over two years through four phases: (1)an extended literature review and policy analysis; (2) interviews with key stakeholders; (3)a period of ethnographic research working with circles of support, real employment and self-advocacy organisations; and (4) a ‘researcher in residence’ phase in which a university researcher will work alongside third sector organisations in order to promote knowledge exchange and impact generation.

Dissemination and impact will be supported by the impact champions sitting on the research management group and through a series of public policy-round tables.29:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2d"}]
