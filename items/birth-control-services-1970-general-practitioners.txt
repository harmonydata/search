Age, sex, marital status, religion, type of practice, whether special sessions held for birth control help, whether any member of practice is a birth control specialist, provision of birth control literature in the waiting room, hours per week spent in general practice, whether ever worked in a family planning clinic, whether attended courses on family planning.18:Tf4a,The purpose of this study was to describe the birth control services in England and Wales (birth control services were interpreted broadly to include sterilization and therapeutic abortion as well as conventional methods) and also to study variations in services between areas.
The Birth Control Services study consisted of 5 surveys:
SN:402 <i>General Practitioners</i> recorded information about advice given by general practitioners and the views of general practitioners about their role in relation to conventional birth control as well as in relation to therapeutic abortion and sterilisation. Close attention was given to the pill, its possible health hazards, prolonged use, and side effects.
SN:909 <i>Health Visitors and Midwives</i> collected data about advice given by health visitors and midwives and their views about their respective roles. The aim was to discover what aspects of birth control (including sterilisation and therapeutic abortion) they feel confident and justified in discussing with the mothers they visit and to what extent they do this.
SN:910 <i>Consultant General Surgeons and Urologists</i> collected information about the views and practice of consultant general surgeons and urologists in relation to sterilisation and in the field of birth control generally. 
SN:911 <i>Consultant Psychiatrists</i> collected information about the role of consultant psychiatrists in advising about terminations of pregnancy.
SN:912 <i>Consultants in Obstetrics and Gynaecology</i> collected information about the views and practice of consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists in relation to sterilisation, terminations of pregnancy and in the fields of birth control generally.  Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
