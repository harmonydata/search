Date (ddmmyy)

Priority
Mandatory

Definition
Admission Date is the date on which an inpatient or day case admission occurs.

Recording Rules
The full date should be entered thus: 2 December 2004=
0	2	1	2	0	4
Points to Note
None.

Cross Checks

Date of Admission is checked to be in sequence with the other dates recorded.
The Patient’s Age is calculated between Date of Birth and Date of Admission, and is used in cross-checks with:
* Specialty
* Diagnosis
Duration of Stay (Stay) is calculated as the time between Date of Admission and Date of Discharge, and is used in cross-checks involving
* Management of Patient
* Significant Facility
* Diagnosis
SMR01 and SMR50 - Waiting Time (Wait) is calculated as the time between Date Placed on Waiting List (when present) and Date of Admission, and is used in cross-checks involving all the Diagnoses recorded.
SMR01 and SMR11 - If Admission Date equals Date of Birth and the Significant Facility is not 11 (Other), 12 (Postnatal Cot), 15 (Neonatal Unit) or 16 (Childrens Unit), the record will always be queried.
SMR02,SMR04 and SMR50 - Admission Date must not equal Date of Birth.
Admission Date is checked against Waiting List Date and, if both dates are the same, the record is queried.

Definition
This item should be seen as describing the main medical (or social) condition managed/investigated during the patients stay.

Recording Rules
The main condition is the condition, diagnosed at the end of the episode of health care, primarily responsible for the patients need for treatment or investigation. If there is more than one such condition, the one held most responsible for the greatest use of resources should be selected. If no diagnosis was made, the main symptom, abnormal finding, or problem should be selected as the main condition.

Points to Note

For patients who have died, the main condition is not necessarily the same as the condition recorded as the cause of death.
The main condition should be decided by a senior member of the medical staff and recorded in the agreed place in the case notes, on the appropriate form or computer system.
If the main condition is coded to a pair of dagger and asterisk codes, the dagger should be entered as main condition.
If the main condition is an injury or other condition due to an external cause, the injury or condition should be entered as main condition with the external cause code following the injury (or injuries).
In the case of the admission record for SMR04 the admission diagnosis would be as defined in the recording rules (but as diagnosed at the beginning of the episode of healthcare). Further guidance is given in the SMR04 section of the electronic data manual.
Cross Checks

A check is made that each Diagnosis Code is valid as defined by the ICD classification. If not, an error will be reported.
A check is made that the use of the code (although listed in the ICD Classification) is actually permitted on the record type. If a discrepancy is found, an appropriate error or query will be reported.
Main condition is cross-checked against:
Sex
Age (except SMR02)
Rarity (except SMR00, and SMR02)
Admission Type (SMR01)
Length of Stay (SMR01 and SMR04)
Waiting Time (SMR01 only)
Discharge Type (SMR01)
Condition on Discharge (SMR02 only)
