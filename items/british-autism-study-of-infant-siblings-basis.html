The primary aim of BASIS is to identify early markers and developmental trajectories associated with autism by studying infants who have older siblings diagnosed with autism, as these infants are at a higher risk of developing the condition themselves. The study employs innovative techniques to assess both brain and behavioral development in these infants, allowing researchers to observe potential differences in developmental patterns compared to infants without a familial history of autism.\n\nBASIS has expanded its scope to also include infants at elevated likelihood for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), recognizing the overlapping and distinct developmental pathways of these neurodevelopmental disorders. By following these infants over time, BASIS aims to improve the understanding of early developmental processes and contribute to the early identification and intervention strategies for autism and ADHD.
