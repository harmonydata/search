Does contributing to these British Chinese sites enable new forms of participation and offer evidence of an emergent ‘second-generation’ civil society?

The key findings of the study suggest that 1) For many British Chinese users, access to the social networks (online and offline) and information resources on these sites provided a key means of meeting other British Born Chinese people (BBC). 2) These British Chinese internet sites facilitated reflection on experiences of racism, minority status, and belonging, and provided an empathetic arena to reflect on the issues raised by living in a multicultural context. 3) The varied exchanges on these web sites reveal how users are grappling with the disjuncture between the simplistic ideal of ‘integration’ and the complex reality behind the seemingly unproblematic lives of well ‘integrated’ minority Britons. 4) Participation on these internet sites is creating the infrastructure to constitute an emergent British Chinese civil society, and is drawing a hitherto underrepresented group into the public domain. Various political initiatives have been mobilized via these web sites, both online and offline. 5) The content and communications stimulated by these British Chinese internet sites have not overcome a lack of understanding of, and engagement with, the formal political process among the British Chinese.
