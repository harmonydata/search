From 1921 onwards the datasets include the name of the company and/or colliery affected.  These data provided a link to published annual data on individual firms and collieries which has been exploited to add contextual data to each strike record.  These contextual data include the numbers employed at the struck colliery and at all the struck company's collieries.  This allows the computation of a 'strike participation rate' for each strike, showing the proportion of the colliery or company mine workforce which was involved in the strike.

Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"British Coal Mining Strikes, 1893-1940"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"British Coal Mining Strikes, 1893-1940"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/british-coal-mining-strikes-1893-1940"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"British Coal Mining Strikes, 1893-1940"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"British Coal Mining Strikes, 1893-1940"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
