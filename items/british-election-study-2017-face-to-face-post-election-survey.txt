Since the election series was originated in 1963 by David Butler and Donald Stokes under the name of Political Change in Britain, 1963-1970, it has been under the direction of a number of academics over time. Besides the main election surveys, other datasets have also been produced. For example, some studies in previous years have included separate sub-samples for ethnic minorities and areas such as Scotland and Northern Ireland (held under SNs 681, 3171, 3889, 3891, and 4622), and several inter-election panel studies have been undertaken between 1969 and 2001 that follow the same individuals interviewed in the cross-sectional surveys (see SNs 422, 2983, 3888, 4000 4028 and 4620). Topics covered in the main study include: issues facing the country; electoral behaviour and attitudes toward voting; party identification, political attitudes (left-right); views on: taxation and government spending, economy/environment, political leaders, immigration, NHS, education; media usage, political engagement and canvassing; economy; democracy, politicians and trust; European Union and EU referendum; image of parties; equal opportunities; likelihood of voting for each party; civil liberties; political participation and constitution; class system; political knowledge and demographics.Topics covered in the CSES module include: political engagement; political system; minorities and British identity; satisfaction with the UK government; left-right placement of parties; fairness of electoral system; political efficacy; closeness to political parties and demographics.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"British Election Study, 2017: Face-to-Face Post-Election Survey"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"British Election Study, 2017: Face-to-Face Post-Election Survey"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/british-election-study-2017-face-to-face-post-election-survey"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"British Election Study, 2017: Face-to-Face Post-Election Survey"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"British Election Study, 2017: Face-to-Face Post-Election Survey"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
