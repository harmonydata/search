Some core questions have been asked at every diary wave, others have been repeated at intervals, some production issues have been considered only once, but in some detail.
In each diary/questionnaire (D1 to D8) a section requested information from respondents concerning the six most recent projects that they worked on.  Respondents were asked to list details such as the production company, broadcaster, genre, their job roles on the projects, length of time spent on each project etc. The dataset does not include all information asked in the questionnaires (please see note in method of data collection).10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"British Film Institute Television Industry Tracking Study, 1994-1998"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"British Film Institute Television Industry Tracking Study, 1994-1998"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/british-film-institute-television-industry-tracking-study-1994-1998"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"British Film Institute Television Industry Tracking Study, 1994-1998"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"British Film Institute Television Industry Tracking Study, 1994-1998"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
