In order to better facilitate such use, a set of 'reconciled' files, the British Household Panel Survey Combined Work-Life History Data, was created, constituting single continuous records each containing all the information of a particular type in a single location.  The first part of the exercise was to take 'current status' information for each wave and combine it with the inter-wave history, and then to combine the waves thus creating a continuous record from September 1990 to the latest wave. The second stage was to take the lifetime employment status history collected at Wave 2, and the lifetime occupational history collected at Wave 3, and to combine each of them with analogous information drawn from the combined panel file, thus creating employment and occupational histories that stretch from the labour market entry to the latest wave.
