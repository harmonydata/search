The third stage was to combine these two extended lifetime histories into a single record which contains both employment status information (with good information about non-employed spells) and occupational information (i.e. details about the job held during each employed spell).  Further details of the methods used are included in the following technical paper: Halpin, B. (1997) Unified BHPS work-life histories: combining multiple sources into a user-friendly format, Technical Papers of the ESRC Research Centre on Micro-Social Change, 13, Colchester: University of Essex. 

Users are recommended to use these data in conjunction with the main BHPS dataset. It should also be noted that this dataset is in package format; see READ file for further details on formats and use.

For the fifth edition (November 2006), the files 'newpan', 'xlempe' and 'xljobe' were updated. The rest of the data and documentation remain unchanged.
