The Main BHPS

The BHPS is carried out by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex. The main objective of the survey is to further understanding of social and economic change at the individual and household level in Britain, to identify, model and forecast such changes, their causes and consequences in relation to a range of socio-economic variables. The BHPS is designed as a research resource for a wide range of social science disciplines and to support interdisciplinary research in many areas. The unique value of the survey resides in that fact that:

it follows the same representative sample of individuals - the panel - over a period of years; 
it is household-based, interviewing every adult member of sampled households; 
it contains sufficient cases for meaningful analysis of certain groups such as the elderly or one parent families; 
it allows for linkage of data both from other surveys and from local area statistics. 

The BHPS was designed as an annual survey of each adult (16+) member of a nationally representative sample of more than 5,000 households, making a total of approximately 10,000 individual interviews. The same individuals are re-interviewed in successive waves and, if they split off from original households, all adult members of their new households are also interviewed. Children are interviewed once they reach the age of 16; there is also a special survey of 11-15 year old household members from wave four. Efficient fieldwork practices, training videos for interviewers and regular contact with the panel members ensures that the sample remains broadly representative of the population as it changes over time.

For the second edition (November 2011) additional labels have been added to missing values.
 Substantively the dataset is broadly in the area of work, family and health, and can also be used to examine social mobility and income mobility.
