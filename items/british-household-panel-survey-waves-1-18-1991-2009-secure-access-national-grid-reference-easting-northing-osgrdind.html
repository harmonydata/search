1991-2009, and was conducted by the ESRC UK Longitudinal Studies Centre 
(ULSC), together with the Institute for Social and Economic Research
 (ISER) at the University of Essex. The ULSC, established in 1999, was a
 continuation of the research resource component of the ESRC Research 
Centre on Micro-Social Change (MISOC), established in 1989. In addition 
to running panel studies, ISER undertakes a programme of research based 
on panel data, using Understanding Society, the BHPS and other national panels to monitor and measure social change. 

The main objective of the BHPS was to further understanding of social 
and economic change at the individual and household level in Britain, 
and to identify, model and forecast such changes and their causes and 
consequences in relation to a range of socio-economic variables. It was 
designed as an annual survey of each adult member (aged 16 years and 
over) of a nationally representative sample of more than 5,000 
households, making a total of approximately 10,000 individual 
interviews. The same individuals were re-interviewed in successive waves
 and, if they left their original households, all adult members of their
 new households were also interviewed. Children were interviewed once 
they reach the age of 16; there was also a special survey of household 
members aged 11-15 included in the BHPS from Wave 4 onwards (the British
 Youth Panel, or BYP). From Wave 9, two additional samples were added to
 the BHPS in Scotland and Wales, and at Wave 11 an additional sample 
from Northern Ireland (which formed the Northern Ireland Household Panel
 Study or NIHPS), was added to increase the sample to cover the whole of
 the United Kingdom. For Waves 7-11, the BHPS also provided data for the
 European Community Household Panel (ECHP). For details of sampling, 
methodology and changes to the survey over time, see Volume A of the 
documentation (Introduction, Technical Report and Appendices).

Secure Access BHPS Dataset:
The British Household Panel Survey, Waves 1-18, 1991-2009: Secure Access, National Grid Reference (Easting, Northing, OSGRDIND) dataset contains British National Grid postcode grid references (at 1m resolution) for each household surveyed, derived from the ONS National Statistics Postcode Directory (ONSPD). Grid references are presented in terms of Eastings and Northings, which are distances in metres (east and north, respectively) from the origin (0,0), which lies to the west of the Scilly Isles. Each grid reference is given a positional quality indicator to denote the accuracy of the grid reference. In the majority of cases, the assigned grid reference relates to the building of the matched address closest to the postcode mean. The grid references provided for Northern Ireland postcodes use the Irish National Grid system that covers all of Ireland and is independent of the British National Grid. No grid references are provided for postcodes in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.

The Secure Access version includes all files in the Special Licence version (see SN 8380), plus files that contain 3 variables relating to the National Grid Reference for each household: Easting, Northing and positional quality indicator (OSGRDIND). The Secure Access version also includes a data file containing full dates of birth of BHPS respondents. All other files are the same as in the Special Licence version, which is held under SN 8380. The Secure Access version of the dataset has more restrictive access conditions than other BHPS studies - see &#x27;Access&#x27; tab.International Data Access Network (IDAN)These data are now available to researchers based outside the UK. Selected UKDS SecureLab/controlled datasets from the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) and the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) have been made available under the International Data Access Network (IDAN) scheme, via a Safe Room access point at one of the UKDS IDAN partners. Prospective users should read the UKDS SecureLab application guide for non-ONS data for researchers outside of the UK via Safe Room Remote Desktop Access. Further details about the IDAN scheme can be found on the UKDS International Data Access Network webpage and on the IDAN website.Latest edition informationFor the fourth edition (October 2018), Special Licence version files are
 supplied alongside grid reference files instead of the End User Licence
 versions for all waves. Minor changes to waves 1 to 18 have been 
incorporated. The grid reference files remain unchanged. A new full 
dates of birth file is included with the BHPS waves for the first time.

details. The questionnaire package consists of the following elements:a household coversheeta

In addition \\nto running panel studies, ISER undertakes a programme of research based \\non panel data, using Understanding Society, the BHPS and other national panels to monitor and measure social change. \\n\\nThe main objective of the BHPS was to further understanding of social \\nand economic change at the individual and household level in Britain, \\nand to identify, model and forecast such changes and their causes and \\nconsequences in relation to a range of socio-economic variables. It was \\ndesigned as an annual survey of each adult member (aged 16 years and \\nover) of a nationally representative sample of more than 5,000 \\nhouseholds, making a total of approximately 10,000 individual \\ninterviews. The same individuals were re-interviewed in successive waves\\n and, if they left their original households, all adult members of their\\n new households were also interviewed. Children were interviewed once \\nthey reach the age of 16; there was also a special survey of household \\nmembers aged 11-15 included in the BHPS from Wave 4 onwards (the British\\n Youth Panel, or BYP). From Wave 9, two additional samples were added to\\n the BHPS in Scotland and Wales, and at Wave 11 an additional sample \\nfrom Northern Ireland (which formed the Northern Ireland Household Panel\\n Study or NIHPS), was added to increase the sample to cover the whole of\\n the United Kingdom. For Waves 7-11, the BHPS also provided data for the\\n European Community Household Panel (ECHP).

Grid references are presented in terms of Eastings and Northings, which are distances in metres (east and north, respectively) from the origin (0,0), which lies to the west of the Scilly Isles. Each grid reference is given a positional quality indicator to denote the accuracy of the grid reference. In the majority of cases, the assigned grid reference relates to the building of the matched address closest to the postcode mean. The grid references provided for Northern Ireland postcodes use the Irish National Grid system that covers all of Ireland and is independent of the British National Grid. No grid references are provided for postcodes in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.\\n\\nThe Secure Access version includes all files in the Special Licence version (see SN 8380), plus files that contain 3 variables relating to the National Grid Reference for each household: Easting, Northing and positional quality indicator (OSGRDIND). The Secure Access version also includes a data file containing full dates of birth of BHPS respondents. All other files are the same as in the Special Licence version, which is held under SN 8380. The Secure Access version of the dataset has more restrictive access conditions than other BHPS studies - see 'Access' tab.International Data Access Network (IDAN)These data are now available to researchers based outside the UK.

Grid references are presented in terms of Eastings and Northings, which are distances in metres (east and north, respectively) from the origin (0,0), which lies to the west of the Scilly Isles. Each grid reference is given a positional quality indicator to denote the accuracy of the grid reference. In the majority of cases, the assigned grid reference relates to the building of the matched address closest to the postcode mean. The grid references provided for Northern Ireland postcodes use the Irish National Grid system that covers all of Ireland and is independent of the British National Grid. No grid references are provided for postcodes in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.\n\nThe Secure Access version includes all files in the Special Licence version (see SN 8380), plus files that contain 3 variables relating to the National Grid Reference for each household: Easting, Northing and positional quality indicator (OSGRDIND).
