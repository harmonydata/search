In addition to running panel studies, ISER undertakes a programme of research based on panel data, using Understanding Society (see below), the BHPS and other national panels to monitor and measure social change. 

The main objective of the BHPS was to further understanding of social and economic change at the individual and household level in Britain, and to identify, model and forecast such changes and their causes and consequences in relation to a range of socio-economic variables. It was designed as an annual survey of each adult member (aged 16 years and over) of a nationally representative sample of more than 5,000 households, making a total of approximately 10,000 individual interviews. The same individuals were re-interviewed in successive waves and, if they left their original households, all adult members of their new households were also interviewed. Children were interviewed once they reach the age of 16; there was also a special survey of household members aged 11-15 included in the BHPS from Wave 4 onwards (the British Youth Panel, or BYP). From Wave 9, two additional samples were added to the BHPS in Scotland and Wales, and at Wave 11 an additional sample from Northern Ireland (which formed the Northern Ireland Household Panel Study or NIHPS), was added to increase the sample to cover the whole of the United Kingdom. For Waves 7-11, the BHPS also provided data for the European Community Household Panel (ECHP). For details of sampling, methodology and changes to the survey over time, see Volume A of the documentation (Introduction, Technical Report and Appendices). From Wave 19, the BHPS was subsumed into a new longitudinal study called Understanding Society, or the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), conducted by ISER. The BHPS Wave 19 is part of Understanding Society Wave 2 (January 2010-March 2011) (see under SN 6614). Further information is available on the Understanding Society series webpage.

BHPS Geographic data and other related studies:BHPS Medium-level Geographical Identifiers and Low-level Geographical Identifiers are available to registered users, subject to Special Licence access conditions;British National Grid postcode grid references for each BHPS household surveyed are also available, subject to Secure Access conditions;Several datasets from ISER-based BHPS research, and teaching/sampler data are also available;For details of all related data, see the BHPS series webpage. The  British Household Panel Survey, Waves 1-18, 1991-2008: 1991 Ward, Census Code Range (WARDC91) dataset contains the 1991 Electoral Ward (Census code range) geographic variable for each wave of the BHPS to date, and a household identification serial number for file matching to the main BHPS data. These data have more restrictive access conditions than those available under the standard End User Licence (see 'Access' section below). Those users who wish to make an application for these data should contact the HelpDesk for further details.

For the second edition (January 2014) revised geographic data files for each wave have been deposited. The documentation has also been updated.

 Variables include household identification number and 1991 Electoral Ward codes for matching with each wave of the BHPS to date.1f:["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:description","content":"$2e"}]

2f:Te6c,The British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) ran for 19 waves, from 1991-2009, and was conducted by the ESRC UK Longitudinal Studies Centre (ULSC), together with the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex. The ULSC, established in 1999, is a continuation of the research resource component of the ESRC Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MISOC), established in 1989.
