This dataset is subject to restrictive access conditions, different to those for the main BHPS: see Information box on the right or Access section below.

For the fourth edition (January 2014) revised geographic data files for each wave have been deposited. The documentation has also been updated.

 Variables include household identification number and LEA codes for matching with each wave of the BHPS to date.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"British Household Panel Survey, Waves 1-18, 1991-2009: Special Licence Access, Local Education Authorities"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"British Household Panel Survey, Waves 1-18, 1991-2009: Special Licence Access, Local Education Authorities"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/british-household-panel-survey-waves-1-18-1991-2009-special-licence-access-local-education-authorities"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"British Household Panel Survey, Waves 1-18, 1991-2009: Special Licence Access, Local Education Authorities"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"British Household Panel Survey, Waves 1-18, 1991-2009: Special Licence Access, Local Education Authorities"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
