For the fourth edition (January 2014) revised geographic data files for each wave have been deposited. The documentation has also been updated.

 Variables include household identification number and PCT codes for matching with each wave of the BHPS to date.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"British Household Panel Survey, Waves 1-18, 1991-2009: Special Licence Access, Primary Care Trusts / BHPS"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"British Household Panel Survey, Waves 1-18, 1991-2009: Special Licence Access, Primary Care Trusts / BHPS"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/british-household-panel-survey-waves-1-18-1991-2009-special-licence-access-primary-care-trusts-bhps"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"British Household Panel Survey, Waves 1-18, 1991-2009: Special Licence Access, Primary Care Trusts / BHPS"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"British Household Panel Survey, Waves 1-18, 1991-2009: Special Licence Access, Primary Care Trusts / BHPS"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
