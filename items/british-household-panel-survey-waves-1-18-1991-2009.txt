 from Wave 4 to Wave 11, the youth questionnaire (aged 11-16 years) was
 administered using a 'Walkman' personal cassette tape player and a blank

 From Wave 12 onwards, a normal self-completion script has been used.16:T140f,The British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) ran for 18 waves, from 
1991-2009, and was conducted by the ESRC UK Longitudinal Studies Centre 
(ULSC), together with the Institute for Social and Economic Research
 (ISER) at the University of Essex. The ULSC, established in 1999, was a
 continuation of the research resource component of the ESRC Research 
Centre on Micro-Social Change (MISOC), established in 1989. In addition 
to running panel studies, ISER undertakes a programme of research based 
on panel data, using Understanding Society, the BHPS and other national panels to monitor and measure social change. 

The main objective of the BHPS was to further understanding of social 
and economic change at the individual and household level in Britain, 
and to identify, model and forecast such changes and their causes and 
consequences in relation to a range of socio-economic variables. It was 
designed as an annual survey of each adult member (aged 16 years and 
over) of a nationally representative sample of more than 5,000 
households, making a total of approximately 10,000 individual 
interviews. The same individuals were re-interviewed in successive waves
 and, if they left their original households, all adult members of their
 new households were also interviewed. Children were interviewed once 
they reach the age of 16; there was also a special survey of household 
members aged 11-15 included in the BHPS from Wave 4 onwards (the British
 Youth Panel, or BYP). From Wave 9, two additional samples were added to
 the BHPS in Scotland and Wales, and at Wave 11 an additional sample 
from Northern Ireland (which formed the Northern Ireland Household Panel
 Study or NIHPS), was added to increase the sample to cover the whole of
 the United Kingdom. For Waves 7-11, the BHPS also provided data for the
 European Community Household Panel (ECHP). For details of sampling, 
methodology and changes to the survey over time, see Volume A of the 
documentation (Introduction, Technical Report and Appendices). 

Further information may be found on the ISER BHPS webpages.For the eighth edition (October 2018) all data files were replaced with new versions. The main changes are: a) the addition to the main dataset of net income variables, previously released separately; b) the addition of variables to assist linkage to the Understanding Society dataset (SN 6614) which includes BHPS sample members; c) some enhancements to data included in the XWAVEDAT file, and d) a range of data corrections mainly from user comments: these include limited corrections to income data, fixing issues with employment history and occupation data at wave 18 and some issues with weights. Volume A of the documentation has been updated to provide further details on the changes. This edition also splits the previous SN 5151 into an End User Licence (EUL) / Special Licence split to reflect Understanding Society. The variables excluded from the EUL version relate to month of birth (day of birth is not included in either version), full occupation codes, rare country of birth / nationality occurrences, and the full urban-rural classification. Data users should also note that the income variables have been top-coded for the EUL release. 
 The questionnaire package consists of the following elements:a
 household coversheet a household composition form comprising a
 complete listing of all household members, together with some brief summary
 data of their gender, date of birth, marital and employment status and their
 relationship to the household reference persona short household
 questionnaire containing questions about the accommodation and tenure and some
 household-level measures of consumption an individual schedule asked
 of every adult member of the household (aged 16 or over), covering:
 neighbourhood; individual demographics; residential mobility; health and
 caring; current employment and earnings; employment changes over the past
 year; lifetime childbirth, marital and relationship history (Wave 2 for the
 main sample, supplemented for new entrants from Wave 8 onwards); employment
 status history (Wave 2 only); values and opinions; household finances and
