In order to provide a fuller picture of the relationship between party activity and election outcomes this research will also assess the relationship between government activity (as reflected in the state of the economy and public spending) and public opinion. In particular, it will assess the general proposition that demands for government activity increase under Conservative governments and decrease under Labour governments. This part of the research will, therefore, provide a fuller understanding of the trends and cycles in public opinion that have been noted by many scholars, journalists and politicians.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"The British macro-polity"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"The British macro-polity"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/british-macro-polity"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"The British macro-polity"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The British macro-polity"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
