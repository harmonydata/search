The series is designed to produce annual measures of attitudinal movements to complement large-scale government surveys that deal largely with facts and behaviour patterns, and the data on party political attitudes produced by opinion polls. One of the BSA&#x27;s main purposes is to allow the monitoring of patterns of continuity and change, and the examination of the relative rates at which attitudes, in respect of a range of social issues, change over time. Some questions are asked regularly, others less often. Funding for BSA comes from a number of sources (including government departments, the Economic and Social Research Council and other research foundations), but the final responsibility for the coverage and wording of the annual questionnaires rests with NatCen Social Research (formerly Social and Community Planning Research). The BSA has been conducted every year since 1983, except in 1988 and 1992 when core funding was devoted to the British Election Study (BES).Further information about the series and links to publications may be found on the NatCen Social Research British Social Attitudes webpage.
Background
The British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey series began in 1983. The series is designed to produce annual measures of attitudinal movements which will complement large-scale government surveys such as the General Lifestyle Survey and the Labour Force Survey, which deal largely with facts and behaviour patterns, as well as the data on party political attitudes produced by the polls. One of the BSA&#x27;s main purposes is to allow the monitoring of patterns of continuity and change, and the examination of the relative rates at which attitudes, in respect of a range of social issues, change over time. Some questions are asked regularly, others less often.
Further information about the series and links to publications may be found on the NatCen Social Research British Social Attitudes website.
BSA 2023
Since 2020 BSA has operated with a push-to-web design, with telephone opt-in to cover the offline population.
The BSA 2023 report, including Key Findings, is available from the NatCen BSA website.
MAIN TOPICS
Each year the interview questionnaire contains a number of &#x27;core&#x27; questions, which are repeated in most years. In addition, a wide range of background and classificatory questions is included. The remainder of the questionnaire is devoted to a series of questions (modules) on a range of social, economic, political and moral issues - some asked regularly, others less often. Cross-indexes of those questions asked more than once appear in the reports.
In 2023 the questionnaire included the following topics: Household Composition,
Employment, Politics, Benefits and Income, National Identity and Ethnicity, Religion, Disability, Education, Changing Identities, Role of the Government, Pensions &amp; Retirement, Poverty, Fraud &amp; Error, Social Class, Satisfaction with Health and Care Services, Health and Care Spending, NHS Priorities and Principles, Devolution, Electoral Voting Reform, European Union, Immigration, Equal Opportunities, Climate Change and the Environment, Housing, Building New Homes.
