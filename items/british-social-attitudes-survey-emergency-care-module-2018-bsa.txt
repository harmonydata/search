The BSA module was designed to identify factors affecting population tendency to use emergency services for minor or non-urgent problems, partly through the use of vignettes asking what actions people would take in relation to minor or non-urgent health problems.
The study covers the following topics: tendency to seek emergency healthcare for minor problems, attitudes to Accident and Emergency departments, attitudes to General Practice, use of 999 ambulances, A&E departments and GP appointments, and health literacy.26:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2a"}]
