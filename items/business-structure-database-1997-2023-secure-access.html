The BSD is derived primarily from the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR), which is a live register of data collected by HM Revenue and Customs via VAT and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) records.  The IDBR data are complimented with data from ONS business surveys. If a business is liable for VAT (turnover exceeds the VAT threshold) and/or has at least one member of staff registered for the PAYE tax collection system, then the business will appear on the IDBR (and hence in the BSD).  In 2004 it was estimated that the businesses listed on the IDBR accounted for almost 99 per cent of economic activity in the UK.  Only very small businesses, such as the self-employed were not found on the IDBR.

The IDBR is frequently updated, and contains confidential information that cannot be accessed by non-civil servants without special permission.  However, the ONS Virtual Micro-data Laboratory (VML) created and developed the BSD, which is a &#x27;snapshot&#x27; in time of the IDBR, in order to provide a version of the IDBR for research use, taking full account of changes in ownership and restructuring of businesses.  The &#x27;snapshot&#x27; is taken around April, and the captured point-in-time data are supplied to the VML by the following September. The reporting period is generally the financial year.  For example, the 2000 BSD file is produced in September 2000, using data captured from the IDBR in April 2000.  The data will reflect the financial year of April 1999 to March 2000.  However, the ONS may, during this time, update the IDBR with data on companies from its own business surveys, such as the Annual Business Survey (SN 7451).

The data are divided into &#x27;enterprises&#x27; and &#x27;local units&#x27;.  An enterprise is the overall business organisation.  A local unit is a &#x27;plant&#x27;, such as a factory, shop, branch, etc.  In some cases, an enterprise will only have one local unit, and in other cases (such as a bank or supermarket), an enterprise will own many local units.

For each company, data are available on employment, turnover, foreign ownership, and industrial activity based on Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)92, SIC 2003 or SIC 2007.  Year of &#x27;birth&#x27; (company start-up date) and &#x27;death&#x27; (termination date) are also included, as well as postcodes for both enterprises and their local units. Previously only pseudo-anonymised postcodes were available but now all postcodes are real.

The ONS is continually developing the BSD, and so researchers are strongly recommended to read all documentation pertaining to this dataset before using the data.

Linking to Other Business Studies
These data contain IDBR reference numbers.  These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations.  Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together.  Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research.
Latest Edition Information
For the sixteenth edition (March 2024), data files and a variable catalogue document for 2023 have been added.
 The following variables are available for enterprises and local units:employment (and employees)turnoverStandard Industrial Classification (1992, 2003 and 2007 classifications are available)legal status (e.g. sole proprietor, partnership, public corporation, non-profit organisation etc)foreign ownershipbirth (company start date)death (termination date of trading)various geographical variables&#x27;Employment&#x27; includes business owners, whereas &#x27;employees&#x27; measures the number of staff, excluding owners.

Observations for enterprises also include a variable for ownership if the enterprise is part of a large group of companies.

Local units have an additional ‘death code’ variable, which serves as an indicator as to why the plant closed (e.g. as a result of a merger).  It should also be noted that there is no turnover information for individual plants.  This is because the ONS does not collect financial information at the plant level, which is notoriously difficult, especially for manufacturing plants where often no financial transactions are processed.

The birth and death variables are particularly useful for research, although it should be noted that for businesses that began trading before 1973, their birth date will be set to 1973.  This is the year that VAT was introduced in the UK, and hence the first point in time for VAT registration for these companies.  Companies that began trading since 1973 have their ‘real’ date of birth listed."/><meta property="og:title" content="Business Structure Database, 1997-2023: Secure Access"/><meta property="og:description" content="The Business Structure Database (BSD) contains a small number of variables for almost all business organisations in the UK.

The BSD is derived primarily from the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR), which is a live register of data collected by HM Revenue and Customs via VAT and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) records.  The IDBR data are complimented with data from ONS business surveys. If a business is liable for VAT (turnover exceeds the VAT threshold) and/or has at least one member of staff registered for the PAYE tax collection system, then the business will appear on the IDBR (and hence in the BSD).  In 2004 it was estimated that the businesses listed on the IDBR accounted for almost 99 per cent of economic activity in the UK.  Only very small businesses, such as the self-employed were not found on the IDBR.\\n\\nThe IDBR is frequently updated, and contains confidential information that cannot be accessed by non-civil servants without special permission.  However, the ONS Virtual Micro-data Laboratory (VML) created and developed the BSD, which is a 'snapshot' in time of the IDBR, in order to provide a version of the IDBR for research use, taking full account of changes in ownership and restructuring of businesses.  The 'snapshot' is taken around April, and the captured point-in-time data are supplied to the VML by the following September. The reporting period is generally the financial year.  For example, the 2000 BSD file is produced in September 2000, using data captured from the IDBR in April 2000.  The data will reflect the financial year of April 1999 to March 2000.  However, the ONS may, during this time, update the IDBR with data on companies from its own business surveys, such as the Annual Business Survey (SN 7451).\\n\\nThe data are divided into 'enterprises' and 'local units'.  An enterprise is the overall business organisation.  A local unit is a 'plant', such as a factory, shop, branch, etc.  In some cases, an enterprise will only have one local unit, and in other cases (such as a bank or supermarket), an enterprise will own many local units.\\n\\nFor each company, data are available on employment, turnover, foreign ownership, and industrial activity based on Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)92, SIC 2003 or SIC 2007.  Year of 'birth' (company start-up date) and 'death' (termination date) are also included, as well as postcodes for both enterprises and their local units.

Year of 'birth' (company start-up date) and 'death' (termination date) are also included, as well as postcodes for both enterprises and their local units. Previously only pseudo-anonymised postcodes were available but now all postcodes are real.\n\nThe ONS is continually developing the BSD, and so researchers are strongly recommended to read all documentation pertaining to this dataset before using the data.\n\nLinking to Other Business Studies\nThese data contain IDBR reference numbers.  These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations.  Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together.  Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research.\nLatest Edition Information\nFor the sixteenth edition (March 2024), data files and a variable catalogue document for 2023 have been added.\n The following variables are available for enterprises and local units:employment (and employees)turnoverStandard Industrial Classification (1992, 2003 and 2007 classifications are available)legal status (e.g. sole proprietor, partnership, public corporation, non-profit organisation etc)foreign ownershipbirth (company start date)death (termination date of trading)various geographical variables'Employment' includes business owners, whereas 'employees' measures the number of staff, excluding owners.\n\nObservations for enterprises also include a variable for ownership if the enterprise is part of a large group of companies.\n\nLocal units have an additional ‘death code’ variable, which serves as an indicator as to why the plant closed (e.g. as a result of a merger).  It should also be noted that there is no turnover information for individual plants.  This is because the ONS does not collect financial information at the plant level, which is notoriously difficult, especially for manufacturing plants where often no financial transactions are processed.\n\nThe birth and death variables are particularly useful for research, although it should be noted that for businesses that began trading before 1973, their birth date will be set to 1973.  This is the year that VAT was introduced in the UK, and hence the first point in time for VAT registration for these companies.  Companies that began trading since 1973 have their ‘real’ date of birth listed."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Business Structure Database, 1997-2023: Secure Access\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$16\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"Business Structure Database, 1997-2023: Secure Access\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"$17\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/business-structure-database-1997-2023-secure-access\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:site_name\",\"content\":\"Academic Resource Discovery\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:locale\",\"content\":\"en_US\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:image:width\",\"content\":\"1200\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:image:height\",\"content\":\"630\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"og:image:alt\",\"content\":\"Business Structure Database, 1997-2023: Secure Access\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"website\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary_large_image\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"Business Structure Database, 1997-2023: Secure Access\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$18\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"17\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"c:null\n"])</script></body></html>
