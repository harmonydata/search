12:T66e,The Attitudes to Pensions Survey series aims to investigate attitudes to pensions and private financial preparations for later life in Great Britain. The baseline survey was conducted in 2006 with a follow-up conducted in 2009. These two surveys were both conducted by NatCen Social Research on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The 2012 survey was conducted by TNS BMRB on behalf of DWP. One of the key aims of the survey series is to examine continuity and change in attitudes to financial planning for retirement over time so a large number of the questions have been repeated over all three surveys.

Attitudes to Pensions Survey, 2006 was the first survey in the series. The main aim of the survey was to collect robust and reliable data on views about pensions and retirement, as well as establishing respondents' views on associated topics such as saving, risk and financial decision-making. In addition to collecting a broad range of attitudinal data, a second aim was to explore the extent of knowledge about pensions, both about the way the state pension and private pensions work, and also about the respondent's own pension provision, future retirement income and likely life expectancy. Thirdly, in addition to covering attitudes and knowledge, the survey also collected information regarding behaviour in relation to pension provision and savings. Key socio-economic and demographic information was also collected, to allow analysis by respondent characteristics.
 The interview covered: attitudes towards pensions, savings, risk and financial planning; and financial retirement planning knowledge and behaviour.13:T66e,The Attitudes to Pensions Survey series aims to investigate attitudes to pensions and private financial preparations for later life in Great Britain.
