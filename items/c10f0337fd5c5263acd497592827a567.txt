Accurate perception of the behaviour of other individuals is essential for making correct decisions on how to respond to and interact with them and is, therefore, critical to successful social functioning. Perception, however can be profoundly biased over the short term (<10 seconds) by our immediate prior experience, leading to incorrect judgments of our external social world. Incorrect interpretation of the behaviour of other individuals can have very profound consequences, causing difficulties in social interactions, and for individuals that make critical behavioural judgments as part of their job (e.g. police surveillance), incorrect interpretation of human behaviour can have severe consequences.

The project will employ the novel use of immersive virtual reality techniques to recreate and tightly control the behaviour of real-sized 3-dimensional actors, and exploit short-term distortions in perception to elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying social perception within simulated naturalistic social conditions. This project will investigate how our immediate visual experience influences: 1. Recognition of human actions, 2. Understanding of human behaviour, 3. Predictions of other people’s expectations, 4. Perception of the trustworthiness of other individuals when viewing CCTV footage and in Police officers.13:T663,Data includes:
