The SILCI project ran from 2016 - 2021 at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, University of East Anglia and was funded by the European Research Council (ERC) through the Starting Grant #678799. Further details on the SILCI project and related publications can be found at: http://www.silci.org.\nThe SILCI project explored disruptive low carbon innovations and how they spread through processes of social influence.\nAs part of the SILCI project, a national online survey was conducted in the UK in 2019 to understand consumers' perceptions, communication behaviour, and adoption propensity towards a wide range of low-carbon innovations in four different consumer domains: transport, food, homes and energy. These datasets are published on ReShare at URL = https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/854723/\nA repeat survey was conducted with respondents from the previous 2019 UK sample. The survey was implemented by an international market research company between 23rd November and 20th December 2020. A total of n=1175 responses were collected. The survey responses were coded and cleaned by the project team. Both the repeat survey instrument and cleaned response data are made available here.SILCI investigates low carbon disruptive innovations. This project conducts empirical research to understand what are potentially disruptive low carbon innovations, what novel attributes they offer users, and what impact might their widespread adoption have on emissions. As well as identifying and characterising disruptive low carbon innovations across sectors and applications, SILCI is interested in how and why they are adopted, and so how they spread. Information exchanged through social networks, through online activity, and through physical activity in neighbourhoods influences people’s behaviour. Social influence plays an important role in diffusing innovations. SILCI explores what role social influence plays in the diffusion of disruptive low carbon innovations and how these diffusion processes can be accelerated to help reduce emissions."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Social Influence and Disruptive Low Carbon Innovations Repeat Survey, 2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$12\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"Social Influence and Disruptive Low Carbon Innovations Repeat Survey, 2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"$13\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/c21b22b9fda3afc971d098df4d609e5d\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:site_name\",\"content\":\"Academic Resource Discovery\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:locale\",\"content\":\"en_US\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:image:width\",\"content\":\"1200\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:image:height\",\"content\":\"630\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"og:image:alt\",\"content\":\"Social Influence and Disruptive Low Carbon Innovations Repeat Survey, 2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"website\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary_large_image\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"Social Influence and Disruptive Low Carbon Innovations Repeat Survey, 2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$14\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"17\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]]\nc:null\n"])</script></body></html>
