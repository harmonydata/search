Only the survey data are currently included in this dataset, covering four groups: IFAs; public sector employees with a defined benefit pension plan; private sector employees whose organisation operated a defined contribution pension plan; and members of the general public who were mainly self-employed.\n\nFurther information and links to publications may be found on the Pensions Online project web page. Topics covered in the questionnaires included: pension plan membership, respondents' attitudes to and use of pension plan web sites; outcomes experienced as a result of using the sites and beliefs about future outcomes, important features for inclusion in such sites, general opinions on pension plan provision via the internet; and respondents' demographic characteristics. The questionnaire for IFAs also included a section on company internet presence and impact of internet provision on pensions."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Pensions Online: Producer, Distributor and User Attitudes and Behaviour, 2004-2005\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$12\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"Pensions Online: Producer, Distributor and User Attitudes and Behaviour, 2004-2005\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"$13\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/c24376552d57c5501a2ab7e4cfd295ce\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:site_name\",\"content\":\"Academic Resource Discovery\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:locale\",\"content\":\"en_US\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:image:width\",\"content\":\"1200\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:image:height\",\"content\":\"630\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"og:image:alt\",\"content\":\"Pensions Online: Producer, Distributor and User Attitudes and Behaviour, 2004-2005\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"website\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary_large_image\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"Pensions Online: Producer, Distributor and User Attitudes and Behaviour, 2004-2005\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$14\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"17\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]]\nc:null\n"])</script></body></html>
