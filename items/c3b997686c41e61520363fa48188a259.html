During the project, a web site was created with the aim to provide a web-based training resource about the use of statistical regression methods in educational research. The content is designed to teach users how to perform a variety of regression analyses using SPSS, starting with foundation material in basic statistics and working through to more complex multiple linear, logistic and ordinal regression models. Along with illustrated modules the site contains demonstration videos, interactive quizzes and SPSS exercises and examples that use these LSYPE teaching data. Further information and documentation may be found at the web site, Using Statistical Methods in Education Research. Throughout the site modules users are invited to use the datasets for either following the examples or performing exercises. Prospective users of the data will be directed to register an account in order to download the data.\n\nThe full LSYPE study is held at the Archive under SN 5545.
