12:T908,These teaching datasets, comprising a sub-set of a large-scale longitudinal study, the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE), were created as part of the NCRM Developing Statistical Modelling in the Social Sciences: Lancaster-Warwick-Stirling Node Phase 2 project, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). During the project, a web site was created with the aim to provide a web-based training resource about the use of statistical regression methods in educational research. The content is designed to teach users how to perform a variety of regression analyses using SPSS, starting with foundation material in basic statistics and working through to more complex multiple linear, logistic and ordinal regression models. Along with illustrated modules the site contains demonstration videos, interactive quizzes and SPSS exercises and examples that use these LSYPE teaching data. Further information and documentation may be found at the web site, Using Statistical Methods in Education Research. Throughout the site modules users are invited to use the datasets for either following the examples or performing exercises. Prospective users of the data will be directed to register an account in order to download the data.

The full LSYPE study is held at the Archive under SN 5545. The teaching datasets include information drawn from Wave 1 of LSYPE, conducted in 2004, with GCSE results matched from Wave 3 (2006). Further information about the NCRM Node project covering this study may be found on the Developing Statistical Modelling in the Social Sciences ESRC award web page.

Documentation
There is currently no discrete documentation currently available with these teaching datasets; users should consult the web site noted above. Documentation covering the main LSYPE study is available with SN 5545.

For the second edition (July 2011), updated versions of the SPSS data files were deposited to resolve minor anomalies.
 The teaching datasets include variables covering LSYPE respondents' educational test results, academic achievement and school life, and demographic/household characteristics including ethnic group, gender, social class and socio-economic status, computer ownership, private education, and mothers' occupational status and educational background.13:T908,These teaching datasets, comprising a sub-set of a large-scale longitudinal study, the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE), were created as part of the NCRM Developing Statistical Modelling in the Social Sciences: Lancaster-Warwick-Stirling Node Phase 2 project, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC).
