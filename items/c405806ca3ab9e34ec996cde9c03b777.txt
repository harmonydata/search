12:Ta07,Datasets present text data stemming from academic articles (Scopus and WoS) and Policy documents collected from EU institutional repositories (European Commission, European Parliament, Council of the European Union). The data was collected from January to May 2023, as part of the "Digital Sovereignty by Design" research project framework. The primary purpose of this data collection is to conduct topic modelling, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), in order to identify current debates on digital sovereignty through international relations and political science lenses. 

We seek to identify and demonstrate the state-of-the-art with revealing trends and insights, mapping complex research and the political landscape of digital sovereignty issues in the EU. The objectives are (1) to identify the role played by the concept of digital sovereignty in different fields of studies; (2) to highlight recent trends in the study of digital sovereignty; (3) to identify, within those trends, the most common topics related to digital sovereignty and to trace their development over time; and (4) to explore how those trends and topics related to political regulation and governance within the digital sovereignty sphere.

We present five datasets. One dataset contained academic articles data on digital sovereignty, and four other datasets collected policy documents from EU institutions.
The academic articles' datasets contain complete bibliographic information, abstract and keywords (if available) from 2013 to 2023 with a total N of 156 texts. The datasets for the policy documents include the document's title and its complete text: European Commission from 2009 to 2023 with a total N of 2019 texts (61 from Register; 158 from Commonly used documents); European Parliament from 2011 to 2023 with total N of 368 texts; and Council of the European Union from 2001 to 2023 with total N of 221 texts.The ‘Digital Sovereignty by Design’ project will 1) engage with current law and policy approaches to cybersecurity in the United Kingdom and in the European Union, 2) identify how the EU’s current shift towards a digital sovereignty approach may negatively impact upon UK private-sector technology providers, in particular microprocessors, and 3) consider ways in which these negative impacts may be mitigated. Thus, this project addresses how interaction and competition between stakeholders influence the establishment of regulatory regimes over new technological innovations, or categories of technology, related to digital security and data privacy.13:Ta07,Datasets present text data stemming from academic articles (Scopus and WoS) and Policy documents collected from EU institutional repositories (European Commission, European Parliament, Council of the European Union).
