12:T4f4,The aim of the project was to code text variables originally collected as part of the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) files. Text variables were selected from the original BCS70 studies (held at the Archive under SNs 3535 and 3723) to provide information about health care utilisation of school-aged children.

For the second edition (August 2008), the serial number has been replaced with a new one, variable Bcsid. This change has been made for all datasets in the BCS70 series. In addition, the Child Health and Education Study (CHES) serial numbers present in previous editions have also been removed. Further information may be found in the ‘CLS Confidentiality and Data Security Review’, included in the documentation.

 The dataset contains text for eleven questions in the BCS70 follow-up studies at 10 and 16 years, and the appropriate ICD-9 or OPCS coding of that text. The data are pertinent to the study of health care utilisation of school-aged children. Codes are available for the original variables MEB21 (age 10 years) and for OB12, OB13, OB14, OB15, RA3, RC4, RD6, JB13, L19 and Q12 (age 16 years). See documentation for further details.
