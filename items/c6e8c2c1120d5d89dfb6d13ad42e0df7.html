Focusing a gendered lens on climate resilience, credit and nutrition in Cambodia and South India’ has undertaken cutting-edge interdisciplinary research during the COVID-19 pandemic on some of the most pressing issues impacting rural communities today. \n\nThe data collected - via quantitative surveys, semi-structured qualitative interviews, and photo-elicitation -evidences how household over-indebtedness needs to be understood and tackled in tandem with the climate crisis and the negative impacts these are both having on people’s health and well-being.Small-scale credit is exalted in mainstream development thinking as a key means of supporting women and their families in dealing with daily, ongoing, and often slow-onset climate disasters. Facing growing crises of agricultural productivity from droughts and floods, and taking primary responsibility for the nutritional wellbeing of their households, women are targeted as credit borrowers globally.
