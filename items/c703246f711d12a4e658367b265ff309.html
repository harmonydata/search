Foregrounding class issues and their implications for students’ learning is one of the key purposes.  However, social class and identity formations are complex. Many working class students are mature women.  Minority ethnic students also tend to be mature students.  The intersection of gender, ‘race’, ethnicity, and class is therefore central.
