The first datasheet (Study 1) includes data from an accelerated longitudinal study, in which 362 adolescents (aged 11-16) and 95 adults completed a) computerised tasks measuring emotion regulation abilities and b) questionnaires regarding emotion regulation strategy use, anxiety, depression, aggression, demographics and pubertal status. Teachers also completed questionnaires regarding adolescents’ academic abilities, and behavioural strengths and difficulties. For adolescents, measures were taken at two time points, approximately 10 months apart. Adults contributed data at only one time point. Data are largely quantitative, and include reaction times, task errors, Likert ratings and questionnaire scores. One task yielded qualitative responses, i.e. a written record of specific emotion regulation strategies that participants employed on the task, which asked participants to regulate their emotional responses to age-appropriate emotionally evocative pictures. The second datasheet (Study 2) comprises data from a study investigating the development of a specific emotion regulation strategy known as temporal distancing (e.g. thinking ‘this won’t affect me in 5 years’ time) between adolescence and adulthood (ages 12-22). Eighty-three participants completed a computerised temporal distancing task, during which numerical ratings and skin conductance data were recorded. Participants also completed questionnaires measuring self-reported aggression and anxiety levels. All data for this study are quantitative. The final datasheet (Study 3) includes quantitative data from a pilot study prior to Study 1, conducted in adult participants and using one of the computerised emotion regulation tasks plus questionnaire measures, which resulted in an early publication from the grant.The ability to control emotions is crucial to mental health and wellbeing: evidence shows that poor emotion regulation (ER) is associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety and aggressive behaviour. Research suggests that ER is still developing in adolescence, but also that adolescence is a key time for the emergence of mental illness associated with poor ER.\nThis project aims to investigate how ER develops during normative adolescence between ages 11-16. It will investigate this both cross-sectionally (comparing adolescents of different ages tested at the same time) and longitudinally (comparing the same adolescents between one year and the next). ER will be measured using computerised tasks and questionnaires, completed at school. Parents and teachers will also complete questionnaires about adolescents’ behaviour.\nThe study will measure both explicit ER (conscious use of strategies to control feelings) and implicit ER (the ability to maintain concentration in the presence of emotion).
