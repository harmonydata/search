Focusing on the corpus known as Relaciones Geográficas de la Nueva España (RGs) – one of the most important colonial historical sources of America – concerned with the territory of Mexico, this project is creating and developing novel computational approaches for the semi-automated exploration of thousands of pages contained in these 16th century documents.

DECM_Gazetteer includes all the researched historical toponyms contained in primary and secondary sources. The information is organised by RGs volume. It also includes layers and tables of historical information digitised and/or created by the project from secondary sources. All is accompanied by metadata, including the DECM Gazetteer Registry. This is available in Linked Places format, GIS shapefiles and CSV files.

This set is composed by: a) all toponyms with coordinates, mentioned and disambiguated from the edited collections of the RGs and from secondary sources as specified below; b) 30 geographical layers of additional historical information derived from secondary sources; c) 32 tables with other important historical information related to the RGs; d) a table with the percentages of disambiguation achieved for each volume; e) the DECM Gazetteer Registry; f) a text file with the sources used for disambiguation; and g) a README file with all information on the dataset.
