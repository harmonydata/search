Also completed were some 165 in-depth interviews with firms and regional development institutions (these are not held at the UK Data Archive, for confidentiality reasons).

As far as disparities in economic development are concerned, the research confirmed a convergence of living standards between existing European Union (EU) Member States, combined with increasing geographical and social inequalities within them. Economic development gaps between East-Central Europe (ECE) and the EU increased until recently, while within ECE regional and social inequality also increased sharply.

The research showed that the position of different regional economies is partly the result of the position of key regional producers in wider, pan-European and global production and value creating networks.

Data were collected on the performance of regional economies in each country. A plant-level survey of 482 establishments was completed. Also completed were some 165 in-depth interviews with firms and regional development institutions (these are not held at the UK Data Archive, for confidentiality reasons).\n\nAs far as disparities in economic development are concerned, the research confirmed a convergence of living standards between existing European Union (EU) Member States, combined with increasing geographical and social inequalities within them. Economic development gaps between East-Central Europe (ECE) and the EU increased until recently, while within ECE regional and social inequality also increased sharply.\n\nThe research showed that the position of different regional economies is partly the result of the position of key regional producers in wider, pan-European and global production and value creating networks. More specifically, it identified a deepening division of labour as plants in different parts of Europe take on different yet complementary roles. In ECE plants specialise in assembly and export-production, while much of the design, styling, marketing and retailing (the knowledge-intensive parts of value chains and production networks) remains focused in the West. Nonetheless plants in ECE which became strongly integrated into pan-European production networks often witnessed quite considerable upgrading and improvement of capacity, technology and labour process. \n\nThe research also identified a significant convergence of regional governance and regional development policy mechanisms across Europe, yet with marked differences in the performance of institutions and in the effectiveness of supply-side policy models in regional economies with quite distinct economic, political and cultural characteristics.\nThe project was based at the Centre on European Political Economy, Sussex European Institute, University of Sussex.\n\n The dataset contains the results of a questionnaire survey completed in 1999-2001 of 482 establishments in five sectors and eight European regions. Questionnaires were completed in the South East and North East regions of the UK, in Puglia/Basilicata and Piemonte/Lombardia in Italy, in Slaskie and Dolnoslaskie in Poland, and in Bratislava/Trnava and Presov/Kosice in Slovakia. The survey covered food retailing and four manufacturing industries (textiles and clothing, motor vehicles, steel and chemicals). The manufacturing and retail sector data are contained in two separate data files. The data cover enterprise performance, employment profile, recruitment, training, input-output relations with suppliers and markets, organisation of work, involvement in joint ventures and links with regional institutions.
