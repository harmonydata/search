12:T652,Robotics encompasses a broad range of academic disciplines including engineering, biology, neuroscience, psychology and artificial intelligence. It is a significant area of emerging science, and one where views regarding fact and fiction are particularly confused. Talking Robots aimed to investigate existing public attitudes to robotic technologies and their potential social impacts, alongside an examination of engagement strategies and their effectiveness, using robotics engagement events as examples. 

The project utilised the Walking with Robots network which is an existing series of events generated by prominent UK-based roboticists and science communicators and funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).  Participant reactions to a series of 11 engagement events with a robotic focus were studied. Structured in-depth observations were made of the engagement events examining both verbal and non-verbal communication. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with three distinctive groups: 1) event organisers who arranged the activities, 2) engagers or experts that were involved in the activities, and 3) audience participants or people engaged in activities.

Further information can be found on the ESRC award web page.
