12:Ta8c,Since the spring of 1991, the CSPP has been involved in more than 100 nationwide sample surveys in post-Communist countries. Each round of surveys asks a common core of questions, a unique source for monitoring trends within nations, and comparisons across nations. All research questions and analyses are undertaken independently of government. The New Russia Barometer Surveys (NRB) comprise one series within the CSPP surveys. They have been conducted annually since 1992, and consist of interviews with a stratified representative nationwide sample of Russian adults. The interviews last approximately one hour, and collect information about political, economic and social attitudes and behaviour. Further information is available on the CSPP New Russia Barometer webpages.

 This study comprises three NRB surveys: VIII (January 2000, post-Duma election survey), IX (April 2000, post-presidential election survey) and X (June-July 2001 survey). The project aimed at using the third round of Russian elections (to the Duma in 1999 and to the Presidency in 2000) to understand what type of government is being consolidated in Russia, whether democratic, undemocratic, or an incompletely or partly democratic hybrid. The proposal set out five objectives:
to examine the demands and expectations of the voters through a pair of post-election sample surveysto examine the extent to which Russian experience of the new regime shows it does or does not accord with the rule of law or is corruptto analyse popular support for the new regime and for undemocratic alternativesto compare developments within the Russian Federation with experience of democratisation in Central and Eastern Europeto disseminate up-to-date survey information during and after the two elections through a special purpose Russia Votes web siteAll five objectives have been achieved, usually well beyond the initial intent, for example, conducting three surveys in Russia rather than two, the monitoring of post-election public opinion on a monthly basis, including the Chechen war, and with regard to post-September 11, 2001 events.
 Each questionnaire is divided into modules indicated by letters of the alphabet, with some variation in themes and modules from one survey to the next, and with repetition of trend questions. The modules are: A - Employment; B - Economy; C - Politics; D - Voting/Parties (NRB VIII, NRB IX, and NRB X); E - Law and order (NRB X); F - View of life (NRB VIII); G - Expectations of the future (NRB X); H - Social organisations and networks; I - Current affairs (NRB X); J - International relations (NRB VIII, NRB IX, NRB X); K - Health (NRB IX); and L - Social structure (NRB VIII, NRB IX, NRB X).13:Ta8c,Since the spring of 1991, the CSPP has been involved in more than 100 nationwide sample surveys in post-Communist countries.
