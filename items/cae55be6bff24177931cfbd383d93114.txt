12:T8ec,The Cardiff survey was undertaken for geographical/planning research purposes, in particular to create the geographical data base required by two associated research projects at the University of Bristol and UWIST. These projects are concerned with analysing the characteristics of urban shopping behaviour in the 1980s and developing predictive models which can be used for retail planning purposes.  The Cardiff Consumer Panel Survey, funded by the SSRC, monitored the daily food and grocery shopping behaviour of approximately 500 households from January to July 1982 (24 weeks main monitoring period, plus 2 weeks 'running in' period). It is believed to be the largest, long-term, consumer panel survey of a single urban area which provides information on the exact location (i.e. which shop and shopping centre) of each purchase made by the panel members. In addition, it provides information on the products (and sometimes brands) purchased on each shop visit, the time of the visit, the amount spent at the shop, the travel mode, the shopping trip characteristics, the demographic, socio-economic and attitudinal characteristics of the panel member and the household to which the panel member belongs.
The survey was successfully piloted with SSRC funding in 1980. The main survey had an initial panel size of 605 households. This was reduced by panel attrition over the 26-week monitoring period to 481. It was then further reduced, for purposes of analysis, to a sub-set of 454 'continuous reporters' for whom complete purchasing, demographic, socio-economic and attitudinal information is available. (Demographic and socio-economic information is not available for 3 of these, and for some purposes the sub-set must be reduced to 451).
The data tape consists of: (1) 24 files containing the purchasing records of 454 'continuous reporters' over the main 24-week monitoring period (weeks 03-26); (2) 24 files containing the purchasing records of the 542 panellists who began Week 03 (i.e. 454 'continuous reporters', 27 who completed the main monitoring period but were subsequently excluded, 61 panellists who dropped out of the panel during Weeks 03-26) (3) 1 file containing second (or final) questionnaire data; (4) 1 file containing first (or initial) questionnare data.13:T8ec,The Cardiff survey was undertaken for geographical/planning research purposes, in particular to create the geographical data base required by two associated research projects at the University of Bristol and UWIST.
