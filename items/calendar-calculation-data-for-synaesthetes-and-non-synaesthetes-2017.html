Both groups were trained over a period of three weeks to learn the skill of calendar calculation (i.e. the ability to calculate the day of the week for a given date - e.g. September 18th 1990 was a Tuesday). In each week of training, participants were taught a new rule of the calendar to enable them to learn how to calendar calculate. Participants were tested on their calendar calculation skills after each weekly training session and the data here shows the accuracy and reaction time data for each test. Data from other tests and questionnaires are also presented here (e.g. qualifications, questionnaire data, arithmetic test data). The data shows that synaesthetes have superior calendar calculation skills in the third week of training.In this research programme we will investigate enhanced memory in synaesthesia (e.g. experiencing colours for words). Our general approach is to treat synaesthesia as a &#x27;test case&#x27; to address other important research questions.
 For instance, we consider how synaesthesia can inform general theories of memory. Importantly, not all aspects of memory are enhanced in synaesthesia and this can provide insights into how the memory system is structured. Indeed it is not trivially the case that material that elicits &#x27;extra&#x27; sensations are better remembered: some material that does not evoke extra sensations (such as abstract figures) are also better remembered by synaesthetes.
 We suggest that synaesthetes have widespread changes in their perceptual systems (including but not limited to their extra experiences) and that systems supporting perception can also be engaged in memory. We will use both standard and bespoke tests of memory to explore which aspects of memory are enhanced and we will explore how individual differences in perception (in non-synaesthetes) may relate to performance on certain memory tasks.

This approach makes contact with a much wider contemporary literature on memory including those arguments derived from animal models and patients with amnesia. In principle, studies of superior ability can be just as informative to models of memory as studies of impaired ability, even though the latter approach predominates. Moreover, cognitive psychology as a discipline has historically tended to dismiss rather than embrace individual difference (classifying it as &#x27;noise&#x27; in the data). As such, we seek to tackle important questions relating to memory from a novel angle. 
 
 An understanding of individual differences in memory functioning, derived from our research on synaesthesia, will have significant impact on other areas. For instance, one claim is that enhanced functioning in general may be protective against pathology or cognitive decline in ageing. We will test whether synaesthesia is a protective factor against age-related memory decline. Another claim is that the kind of &#x27;low level&#x27; or &#x27;visualising&#x27; cognitive style that we hypothesise to give rise to enhanced memory in synaesthesia may support enhanced memory in other special populations (e.g. savant memory abilities such as those sometimes found in autism). Although we do not test this directly in our main proposal, our findings will be relevant to those working in this domain and will be explored in a linked PhD.
 To tackle these questions we draw on a wide range of methods in cognitive psychology/neuroscience. We use both standard and bespoke tests of memory to explore which aspects of memory are enhanced. We explore how individual differences in perception (in non-synaesthetes) may relate to performance on certain memory tasks.

Both groups were trained over a period of three weeks to learn the skill of calendar calculation (i.e. the ability to calculate the day of the week for a given date - e.g. September 18th 1990 was a Tuesday). In each week of training, participants were taught a new rule of the calendar to enable them to learn how to calendar calculate. Participants were tested on their calendar calculation skills after each weekly training session and the data here shows the accuracy and reaction time data for each test. Data from other tests and questionnaires are also presented here (e.g. qualifications, questionnaire data, arithmetic test data). The data shows that synaesthetes have superior calendar calculation skills in the third week of training.In this research programme we will investigate enhanced memory in synaesthesia (e.g. experiencing colours for words).
