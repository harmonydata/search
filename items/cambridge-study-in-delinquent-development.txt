The original aim of the CSDD was to describe the development of delinquent and criminal behaviour in inner-city males, to investigate to what extent this could be predicted in advance, why juvenile delinquency began, and why it did or did not continue into adulthood. The focus was also on continuity in behavioural development, on the effects of life events on development, and on predicting future behaviour. The study was not set up to test any one particular theory of delinquency but aimed to test many different hypotheses about the causes and correlates of offending.","url":"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/cambridge-study-in-delinquent-development","keywords":["Cognitive measures","Education","Housing","Language and literacy","Parenting and

Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development","description":"The Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD) is a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 411 males living in South London, first assessed in 1961. The original aim of the CSDD was to describe the development of delinquent and criminal behaviour in inner-city males, to investigate to what extent this could be predicted in advance, why juvenile delinquency began, and why it did or did not continue into adulthood. The focus was also on continuity in behavioural development, on the effects of life events on development, and on predicting future behaviour. The study was not set up to test any one particular theory of delinquency but aimed to test many different hypotheses about the causes and correlates of offending.","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/CSDD.png","publisher":{"name":"University of Cambridge","url":"$undefined","logo":"$undefined"},"funders":[{"name":"HOUK DfE

Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD) is a significant longitudinal research project that began in 1961, focusing on 411 males from South London. The study's primary aim was to explore the development of delinquent and criminal behavior, examining factors that could predict such behavior and understanding why delinquency starts and persists or ceases into adulthood. The CSDD investigates the continuity of behavioral development, the impact of life events, and the prediction of future behavior. It is notable for not adhering to a single theory of delinquency but rather testing multiple hypotheses regarding the causes and correlates of offending. Over the years, the study has provided valuable insights into the life-course development of criminal behavior, highlighting the influence of family, social, and individual factors on delinquency. Its findings have been instrumental in shaping policies and interventions aimed at preventing criminal behavior."}}]]
