12:T8ae,The aim of the research is to investigate the causes of the high  claimant unemployment now found in most of Britain's seaside towns.  The project examines the validity of explanations based not only on  the decline of the traditional tourist base but also on migration  patterns, the operation of the benefits system and housing factors  such as the availability of privately rented former seaside  accommodation suited to some benefit claimants. The extent to which  unemployment in seaside towns differs in origin and nature from that  found in other blackspots, such as the cities and coalfields, is being  given particular attention. The research blends an analysis of aggregate  labour market data on jobs, unemployment, economic inactivity,  migration, and commuting, covering all the principal seaside towns  across Britain, with a survey of non-employed adults of working age  in selected towns.
The questionnaire contains some elements which are identical to the survey of Economically Inactive and Unemployed Men, 1997-1998 (SN:4078).   Subgroups of this survey can be compared to subgroups from the previous survey.  This dataset is from a survey of just over 1,000 non-employed working  age residents in a representative sample of wards across each of 4  seaside towns: Blackpool, Great Yarmouth, Thanet (Margate, Ramsgate  and Broadstairs) and Southport.  The fieldwork took place in 2002 with  a questionnaire administered via a face-to-face interview lasting  15-30 minutes.  All respondents were aged 21-59/64.  The data includes  information on: current economic status of the respondent; social  class/occupation; qualifications; work history; reason for last job  ending; job aspirations and job search; perceived obstacles to  re-employment; health limitations in respect of ability to work;  responsibilities and difficulties with childcare arrangements; housing  tenure and previous tenure; length of time in area and reasons for  moving to area; benefits status; age and marital status. Also included  is the household composition and economic status of other members of  the household.
