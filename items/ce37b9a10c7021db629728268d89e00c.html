The Childcare and Early Years Provision survey series is divided into two survey strands: the Parents’ Survey and the Providers’ Survey. 

The Parents’ Survey provides data on parents’ take-up, views and experiences of childcare.  Families in England are randomly selected from the Child Benefit Records and all parents had children aged 0-14 years. They are asked about their use and experiences of childcare for all children in the family and to give more detailed information about childcare for a particular child (selected at random where there is more than one child in the family). The current Parents&#x27; Survey series replaces two previous surveys: the Survey of Parents of Three and Four-Year-Old Children and Their Use of Early Years Services (conducted between 1997 and 2002) and Parents&#x27; Demand for Childcare, conducted in 1999 and 2001 (see SNs 4380 and 4970 respectively).

The Providers&#x27; Survey monitors the characteristics and development of childcare and early years providers and the workforce in England.  Information was collected on the number and characteristics of providers, the characteristics of the children enrolled, workforce composition, qualifications and training, recruitment and retention, and business operation. The 2016 survey underwent an extensive redesign, which means findings are not comparable with previous surveys.The 2020 survey was
cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic

Childcare Provider Finances Survey, 2012
During 2012, a sample of childcare and childminding professionals, who had previously taken part in the Childcare And Early Years Provision: Providers&#x27; Survey, 2010 (see SN 6882), took part in the Childcare Provider Finances Survey. The survey was designed to provide detailed information on the financial profile of providers offering childcare in England. The survey investigated topics such as the overheads that providers must take account of in their business models, the areas of their provision that are most in need of investment, and their profitability levels and financial concerns.

 Topics covered include the costs of childcare provision, fees, profitability, areas requiring investment and childcare providers&#x27; financial concerns."/><meta property="og:title" content="Childcare Provider Finances Survey, 2012"/><meta property="og:description" content="The introduction of the National Childcare Strategy in 1998 marked a radical shift in government policy and for the first time put childcare provision firmly on the political map.

The Childcare and Early Years Provision survey series is divided into two survey strands: the Parents’ Survey and the Providers’ Survey. \n\nThe Parents’ Survey provides data on parents’ take-up, views and experiences of childcare.  Families in England are randomly selected from the Child Benefit Records and all parents had children aged 0-14 years. They are asked about their use and experiences of childcare for all children in the family and to give more detailed information about childcare for a particular child (selected at random where there is more than one child in the family).
