12:T6ff,Narrative interviews were conducted will all participants, covering reasons that they wanted to train as an osteopath or homeopath, their expectations of a career, their experience of undertaking training, their experience of the transition to practice after graduating and their experiences since then of building a career.  Three participants were no longer practising, seven had made a partial transition to practice and four were fully established practitioners. 
Sociological studies of health and illness have traditionally focused on the practice of and interaction with medical practitioners, to the neglect of understanding individuals' own ways of dealing with health problems within their family or community. One in ten people every year and one in three in their lifetime use, and usually pay out of pocket, for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the UK. Research into CAM is growing, especially studies that look at why patients use it and the effectiveness of individual treatments. However, we know surprisingly little about the practitioners of these types of therapy. It is important to understand more about the knowledge and skills that underpin this kind of healthcare, and how practitioners attempt to ensure the safety and quality of their practice, especially because most complementary therapists work independently rather than having established career structures like doctors, nurses or midwives. The researcher will recruit graduates from CAM training courses to explore their careers and professional development. The study will involve interviewing practitioners about their experience, and observing them in their daily working lives to enable real events to spark off detailed discussions about how they deal with the realities of daily practice.13:T6ff,Narrative interviews were conducted will all participants, covering reasons that they wanted to train as an osteopath or homeopath, their expectations of a career, their experience of undertaking training, their experience of the transition to practice after graduating and their experiences since then of building a career.
