They were then grouped into ten households at a time and one household was selected at random from each group. The sampled records were then scrambled to prevent geographical tracing within a SAR area.

The 1991 Household SAR approximates to a simple stratified random sample of households, although counts of individuals in the household file are subject to the effects of clustering.
