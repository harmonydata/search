The Cardiff Travel Survey 2022 (Wave 2) is an opportunity sample that was collected in 2022 (n=968) by the Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations (CAST), and is the second of a longitudinal series of surveys to be held annually for the duration of the centre. Data for the Cardiff Travel Survey 2022 were collected between 03 May 2022 and 20 July 2022. Participants of the Cardiff Travel Survey 2021 who consented (n=512) were recontacted via email to invite them to take part in the 2022 survey. Furthermore, participants were recruited through posts on social media, such as Facebook® and Twitter®.  Invitations were posted on CAST and investigator accounts. The posts on Twitter and Facebook were promoted to make them more visible in the area. The survey was hosted on the Qualtrics online survey platform and available in both English and Welsh. Inclusion criteria were that participants had to be at least 18 years of age and live in or travel regularly to Cardiff. The English version of the survey was completed by 1,034 respondents and the Welsh version by 28 respondents. Incomplete responses (n=95), defined as those without any answers beyond socio-demographic, were removed from the dataset. A further 4 respondents did not complete the first section on current travel behaviours and were also removed. This left a final sample of n=968 adults. Two hundred and ten (210) of these had also responded to the Cardiff Travel Survey 2021. Participants were asked to create a unique code that can be used match this survey to the previous and next surveys without knowing their identity.


Main topic areas of the questionnaire are: Demographics, Travel behaviours, Physical activity, Physical health and mental wellbeing, Perceptions of infrastructure and environmental quality, Travel-related social identity, Attitudes to active travel, Social norms, Support for transport policies, and Unique ID.The Centre for Climate Change Transformations (C3T) will be a global hub for understanding the profound changes required to address climate change. At its core, is a fundamental question of enormous social significance: how can we as a society live differently - and better - in ways that meet the urgent need for rapid and far-reaching emission reductions?

While there is now strong international momentum on action to tackle climate change, it is clear that critical targets (such as keeping global temperature rise to well within 2 degrees Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels) will be missed without fundamental transformations across all parts of society. C3T&#x27;s aim is to advance society&#x27;s understanding of how to transform lifestyles, organisations and social structures in order to achieve a low-carbon future, which is genuinely sustainable over the long-term.

Our Centre will focus on people as agents of transformation in four challenging areas of everyday life that impact directly on climate change but have proven stubbornly resistant to change: consumption of goods and physical products, food and diet, travel, and heating/cooling. We will work across multiple scales (individual, community, organisational, national and global) to identify and experiment with various routes to achieving lasting change in these challenging areas. In particular, we will test how far focussing on &#x27;co-benefits&#x27; will accelerate the pace of change. Co-benefits are outcomes of value to individuals and society, over and above the benefits from reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These may include improved health and wellbeing, reduced waste, better air quality, greater social equality, security, and affordability, as well as increased ability to adapt and respond to future climate change. For example, low-carbon travel choices (such as cycling and car sharing) may bring health, social and financial benefits that are important for motivating behaviour and policy change. Likewise, aligning environmental and social with economic objectives is vital for behaviour and organisational change within businesses.

Our Research Themes recognise that transformative change requires: inspiring yet workable visions of the future (Theme 1); learning lessons from past and current societal shifts (Theme 2); experimenting with different models of social change (Theme 3); together with deep and sustained engagement with communities, business and governments, and a research culture that reflects our aims and promotes action (Theme 4).

Our Centre integrates academic knowledge from disciplines across the social and physical sciences with practical insights to generate widespread impact. Our team includes world-leading researchers with expertise in climate change behaviour, choices and governance. We will use a range of theories and research methods to fill key gaps in our understanding of transformation at different spatial and social scales, and show how to target interventions to impactful actions, groups and moments in time."/><meta property="og:title" content="Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations: Cardiff Travel Survey, Wave 2, 2022"/><meta property="og:description" content="The Cardiff Travel Survey is a longitudinal survey that aims to (a) establish current and previous (before the coronavirus outbreak) travel habits; (b) explore how travel-related attitudes, social norms and perceptions change over time; and (c) examine the interplay between individual (perceptual) and environmental (infrastructural) factors in travel mode choice, in particular in relation to the uptake of active travel such as walking and cycling in the City of Cardiff, Wales.

previous (before the coronavirus outbreak) travel habits; (b) explore how travel-related attitudes, social norms and perceptions change over time; and (c) examine the interplay between individual (perceptual) and environmental (infrastructural) factors in travel mode choice, in particular in relation to the uptake of active travel such as walking and cycling in the City of Cardiff, Wales.\\n\\nThe Cardiff Travel Survey 2022 (Wave 2) is an opportunity sample that was collected in 2022 (n=968) by the Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations (CAST), and is the second of a longitudinal series of surveys to be held annually for the duration of the centre. Data for the Cardiff Travel Survey 2022 were collected between 03 May 2022 and 20 July 2022. Participants of the Cardiff Travel Survey 2021 who consented (n=512) were recontacted via email to invite them to take part in the 2022 survey. Furthermore, participants were recruited through posts on social media, such as Facebook® and Twitter®.  Invitations were posted on CAST and investigator accounts. The posts on Twitter and Facebook were promoted to make them more visible in the area. The survey was hosted on the Qualtrics online survey platform and available in both English and Welsh. Inclusion criteria were that participants had to be at least 18 years of age and live in or travel regularly to Cardiff. The English version of the survey was completed by 1,034 respondents and the Welsh version by 28 respondents. Incomplete responses (n=95), defined as those without any answers beyond socio-demographic, were removed from the dataset. A further 4 respondents did not complete the first section on current travel behaviours and were also removed. This left a final sample of n=968 adults. Two hundred and ten (210) of these had also responded to the Cardiff Travel Survey 2021. Participants were asked to create a unique code that can be used match this survey to the previous and next surveys without knowing their identity.\\n\\n\\nMain topic areas of the questionnaire are: Demographics, Travel behaviours, Physical activity, Physical health and mental wellbeing, Perceptions of infrastructure and environmental quality, Travel-related social identity, Attitudes to active travel, Social norms, Support for transport policies, and Unique ID.The Centre for Climate Change Transformations (C3T) will be a global hub for understanding the profound changes required to address climate change. At its core, is a fundamental question of enormous social significance: how can we as a society live differently - and better - in ways that meet the urgent need for rapid and far-reaching emission reductions?\\n\\nWhile there is now strong international momentum on action to tackle climate change, it is clear that critical targets (such as keeping global temperature rise to well within 2 degrees Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels) will be missed without fundamental transformations across all parts of society. C3T's aim is to advance society's understanding of how to transform lifestyles, organisations and social structures in order to achieve a low-carbon future, which is genuinely sustainable over the long-term.\\n\\nOur Centre will focus on people as agents of transformation in four challenging areas of everyday life that impact directly on climate change but have proven stubbornly resistant to change: consumption of goods and physical products, food and diet, travel, and heating/cooling. We will work across multiple scales (individual, community, organisational, national and global) to identify and experiment with various routes to achieving lasting change in these challenging areas. In particular, we will test how far focussing on 'co-benefits' will accelerate the pace of change. Co-benefits are outcomes of value to individuals and society, over and above the benefits from reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These may include improved health and wellbeing, reduced waste, better air quality, greater social equality, security, and affordability, as well as increased ability to adapt and respond to future climate change. For example, low-carbon travel choices (such as cycling and car sharing) may bring health, social and financial benefits that are important for motivating behaviour and policy change. Likewise, aligning environmental and social with economic objectives is vital for behaviour and organisational change within businesses.\\n\\nOur Research Themes recognise that transformative change requires: inspiring yet workable visions of the future (Theme 1); learning lessons from past and current societal shifts (Theme 2); experimenting with different models of social change (Theme 3); together with deep and sustained engagement with communities, business and governments, and a research culture that reflects our aims and promotes action (Theme 4).\\n\\nOur Centre integrates academic knowledge from disciplines across the social and physical sciences with practical insights to generate widespread impact. Our team includes world-leading researchers with expertise in climate change behaviour, choices and governance.

The posts on Twitter and Facebook were promoted to make them more visible in the area. The survey was hosted on the Qualtrics online survey platform and available in both English and Welsh. Inclusion criteria were that participants had to be at least 18 years of age and live in or travel regularly to Cardiff. The English version of the survey was completed by 1,034 respondents and the Welsh version by 28 respondents. Incomplete responses (n=95), defined as those without any answers beyond socio-demographic, were removed from the dataset. A further 4 respondents did not complete the first section on current travel behaviours and were also removed. This left a final sample of n=968 adults. Two hundred and ten (210) of these had also responded to the Cardiff Travel Survey 2021. Participants were asked to create a unique code that can be used match this survey to the previous and next surveys without knowing their identity.\n\n\nMain topic areas of the questionnaire are: Demographics, Travel behaviours, Physical activity, Physical health and mental wellbeing, Perceptions of infrastructure and environmental quality, Travel-related social identity, Attitudes to active travel, Social norms, Support for transport policies, and Unique ID.The Centre for Climate Change Transformations (C3T) will be a global hub for understanding the profound changes required to address climate change. At its core, is a fundamental question of enormous social significance: how can we as a society live differently - and better - in ways that meet the urgent need for rapid and far-reaching emission reductions?\n\nWhile there is now strong international momentum on action to tackle climate change, it is clear that critical targets (such as keeping global temperature rise to well within 2 degrees Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels) will be missed without fundamental transformations across all parts of society. C3T's aim is to advance society's understanding of how to transform lifestyles, organisations and social structures in order to achieve a low-carbon future, which is genuinely sustainable over the long-term.\n\nOur Centre will focus on people as agents of transformation in four challenging areas of everyday life that impact directly on climate change but have proven stubbornly resistant to change: consumption of goods and physical products, food and diet, travel, and heating/cooling. We will work across multiple scales (individual, community, organisational, national and global) to identify and experiment with various routes to achieving lasting change in these challenging areas. In particular, we will test how far focussing on 'co-benefits' will accelerate the pace of change. Co-benefits are outcomes of value to individuals and society, over and above the benefits from reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These may include improved health and wellbeing, reduced waste, better air quality, greater social equality, security, and affordability, as well as increased ability to adapt and respond to future climate change. For example, low-carbon travel choices (such as cycling and car sharing) may bring health, social and financial benefits that are important for motivating behaviour and policy change. Likewise, aligning environmental and social with economic objectives is vital for behaviour and organisational change within businesses.\n\nOur Research Themes recognise that transformative change requires: inspiring yet workable visions of the future (Theme 1); learning lessons from past and current societal shifts (Theme 2); experimenting with different models of social change (Theme 3); together with deep and sustained engagement with communities, business and governments, and a research culture that reflects our aims and promotes action (Theme 4).\n\nOur Centre integrates academic knowledge from disciplines across the social and physical sciences with practical insights to generate widespread impact. Our team includes world-leading researchers with expertise in climate change behaviour, choices and governance. We will use a range of theories and research methods to fill key gaps in our understanding of transformation at different spatial and social scales, and show how to target interventions to impactful actions, groups and moments in time."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations: Cardiff Travel Survey, Wave 2, 2022\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$16\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations: Cardiff Travel Survey, Wave 2, 2022\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"$17\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/centre-for-climate-change-and-social-transformations-cardiff-travel-survey-wave-2-2022\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:site_name\",\"content\":\"Academic Resource Discovery\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:locale\",\"content\":\"en_US\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:image:width\",\"content\":\"1200\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:image:height\",\"content\":\"630\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"og:image:alt\",\"content\":\"Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations: Cardiff Travel Survey, Wave 2, 2022\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"website\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary_large_image\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations: Cardiff Travel Survey, Wave 2, 2022\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$18\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"17\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"c:null\n"])</script></body></html>
