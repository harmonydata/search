The experiment is that respondents are randomly allocated to (1) a 'loss' or 'gain' frame of the sustainability index (i.e. the products being MORE sustainable or having a LOWER environmental impact), and (2) getting 'specific' or 'generic' feedback (just saying well done versus also saying 'how much' they saved). This produced a 2 x 2 experimental matrix.

The experiment was conducted with (1) an engaged sample (n=28) of participants who had indicated they were willing to help develop the Greener Beans app, (2) a general sample of UK participants (n=262), and (3) a student sample (n=286). The data were collected via the Qualtrics platform. The overall sample therefore consisted of 576 participants. Data were collected between 27 September 2021 to 9 November 2021 for the engaged  ‘Greener Beans’ sample, between 16 and 18 November 2021 for the national Qualtrics sample, and between 8 April 2022 and 19 May 2022 for the student sample. The Qualtrics sample was broadly representative for gender, age and income. The study took close to 8 minutes to complete on average. No weighting is used for the sample.

In addition to the online supermarket task, the online survey contained question about socio-demographics (gender, age, income, and education), diets, responsibility for grocery shopping, buying frequency of the different product types, affective responses to making sustainable swaps, environmental values and identity, climate beliefs and worry, future consequences, and a number of questions about the shopping task itself.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations: Supermarket Swap Project, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations: Supermarket Swap Project, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/centre-for-climate-change-and-social-transformations-supermarket-swap-project-2021-2022"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations: Supermarket Swap Project, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations: Supermarket Swap Project, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
