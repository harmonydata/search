Overall, 6896 diaries were collected across the 6 waves, allowing analysis of behavioural change between a baseline (in 2016), three national lockdowns, and two intervening periods of the relaxation of social restrictions.The deposited data forms part of wider CTUR projects of ESRC-funded time use research - New Frontiers for Time Use Research, and Time Use Research for National Statistics. Information on time spent in the various activities of daily life provides a comprehensive and exhaustive basis for summarising the activities of a society, yet people in general do not know with any accuracy how much time they devote to their daily activities. For this reason, rather than asking a set of survey questions, such as \"how much time did you spend last week in X activity\", the time use diary instead asks people to record, in sequence, all their activities through the 24-hour day, with their start and end times. Further information both on these projects and the COVID-19 sequence data collection can be found on the CTUR website.Latest edition informationFor the fourth edition (May 2022), the data and documentation files were replaced with updated versions.

2d:Ta22,In 2016 the Centre for Time Use Research developed an online Click and Drag Diary Instrument (CaDDI), collecting population-representative (quota sample) time use diary data from Dynata’s large international market research panel across 9 countries. We fielded the same instrument using the UK panel across the COVID-19 pandemic: in May-June 2020 during the first lockdown; in late August 2020 following the relaxation of social restrictions; in November 2020 during the second lockdown; in January 2021 during the third lockdown; and in August/September 2021 after the lifting of restrictions.Each survey wave collected between 1-3 time use diaries per respondent, recording activities, location, co-presence, device use, and enjoyment across continuous 10-minute episodes throughout the diary day.  The accompanying individual screening questionnaire included information on the standard socio-demographic variables, and a diary day questionnaire containing additional health and diary day related questions was added during wave 2. Overall, 6896 diaries were collected across the 6 waves, allowing analysis of behavioural change between a baseline (in 2016), three national lockdowns, and two intervening periods of the relaxation of social restrictions.The deposited data forms part of wider CTUR projects of ESRC-funded time use research - New Frontiers for Time Use Research, and Time Use Research for National Statistics. Information on time spent in the various activities of daily life provides a comprehensive and exhaustive basis for summarising the activities of a society, yet people in general do not know with any accuracy how much time they devote to their daily activities. For this reason, rather than asking a set of survey questions, such as "how much time did you spend last week in X activity", the time use diary instead asks people to record, in sequence, all their activities through the 24-hour day, with their start and end times. Further information both on these projects and the COVID-19 sequence data collection can be found on the CTUR website.Latest edition informationFor the fourth edition (May 2022), the data and documentation files were replaced with updated versions. Amendments include the replacement of questionnaires with final versions; changes to variable ordering in the questionnaires, dataset and codebook; and updated information on the GHQ questions. See the Summary of Changes document for further details.
