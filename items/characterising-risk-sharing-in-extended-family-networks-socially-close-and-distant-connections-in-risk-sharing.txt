Therefore, who one is linked with and who their links are further linked with will shape both how risk is shared and the amount shared. Specifically, this research will use unique data from Mexico with information on family ties and socio-economic variables to: (1) How do socially close connections (i.e. parents, siblings and children of the head and spouse residing outside the household) and socially distant connections (i.e. the family of one’s siblings’ spouses; as well as uncles, aunts, cousins) affect how well a household’s consumption is protected against idiosyncratic fluctuations in its income?
(2) To what extent does the quality of a connection matter in its effectiveness in providing risk sharing?10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Characterising risk sharing in extended family networks: Socially close and distant connections in risk sharing"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Characterising risk sharing in extended family networks: Socially close and distant connections in risk sharing"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/characterising-risk-sharing-in-extended-family-networks-socially-close-and-distant-connections-in-risk-sharing"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Characterising risk sharing in extended family networks: Socially close and distant connections in risk sharing"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Characterising risk sharing in extended family networks: Socially close and distant connections in risk sharing"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
