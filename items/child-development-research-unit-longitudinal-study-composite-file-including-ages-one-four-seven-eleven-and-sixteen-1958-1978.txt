To achieve a detailed picture of the child's behaviour in the home and its immediate surroundings. To study the mother's behaviour in relation to her child and to see how this alters and develops both in accordance with the child's objective age and in response to his idiosyncratic needs and demands. To investigate not only her observable behaviour, but also her attitudes, emotional and intellectual, towards her child. To document national practices and attitudes in relation to many different aspects of child upbringing and discipline, including the aspirations parents have for their children and their philosophical approach to issues in child upbringing. This dataset contains all the data for the longitudinal study at years 1, 4, 7, 11, 16 and Index data from year 7.
