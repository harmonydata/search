 The Childcare and Early Years Provision: Parents' Survey 2014-15 provides up-to-date and accurate information on parents' childcare arrangements, their views of particular childcare providers, and their views of childcare provision in general. Children aged 0-14 in England were randomly selected from Child Benefit Records and their parents were approached for interview. Parents were asked about their use and experiences of childcare for all children in the household as well as more detailed information about the childcare used for one child within the household (selected randomly where there was more than one child in the household). The current Parents' Survey series replaces two previous surveys: the Survey of Parents of Three and Four Year Old Children and Their Use of Early Years Services (conducted between 1997 and 2002) and the Parents' Demand for Childcare (conducted in 1999 and 2001). The Childcare and Early Years Provision: Parents' Survey, 2014-2015 has two key objectives. The first is to provide salient, up-to date information on parents' use of childcare and early years provision, and their views and experiences of particular childcare providers and childcare provision in general. The second is to continue the time series – which has now been running for over ten years – on issues covered throughout the survey series. With respect to both these objectives, the study aims to provide information to help monitor the progress of policies in the area of childcare and early years education. The Childcare and Early Years Provision: Parents' Survey 2014-2015 covered the following topic areas: For all families: use of childcare in the reference term-time week and the past year; types of providers used for all children, and costs; use of and availability of breakfast and after-school clubs (for families with school-age children); use of and satisfaction with provision of childcare during school holidays in the past year (for families with school-age children); awareness and take-up of entitlement to free early years provision for two-, three- and four-year olds; awareness and receipt of tax credits and subsidies; sources of information about local childcare; views on affordability, availability, flexibility and quality of childcare in the local area; and childcare and working arrangements. For one randomly selected child: detailed record of childcare attendance in the reference week; details of main provider for selected child; reasons for choosing the main provider; additional services offered at the main provider; impact of provider on child development and well-being and influence on home learning environment; parental involvement with the selected child (if selected child aged two to five); and details of parental awareness of Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) (if selected child aged two to five).Classification details for all families: household composition; demographic characteristics (for example ethnicity, qualifications, income); parents' work history over the last two years (including any atypical working hours and whether this caused childcare problems); classification of children according to Special Educational Needs (SEN) and disability or long-standing illness; housing tenure; and contact details for childcare providers and administrative questions.19:T16e3,The introduction of the National Childcare Strategy in 1998 marked a radical shift in government policy and for the first time put childcare provision firmly on the political map. Since then a wide range of childcare initiatives and funding streams have been introduced, and hence there is a need for regular data to aid the evaluation of recent policy interventions in these areas. The Childcare and Early Years Provision survey series is divided into two survey strands: the Parents’ Survey and the Providers’ Survey. 

The Parents’ Survey provides data on parents’ take-up, views and experiences of childcare.  Families in England are randomly selected from the Child Benefit Records and all parents had children aged 0-14 years. They are asked about their use and experiences of childcare for all children in the family and to give more detailed information about childcare for a particular child (selected at random where there is more than one child in the family). The current Parents' Survey series replaces two previous surveys: the Survey of Parents of Three and Four-Year-Old Children and Their Use of Early Years Services (conducted between 1997 and 2002) and Parents' Demand for Childcare, conducted in 1999 and 2001 (see SNs 4380 and 4970 respectively).

The Providers' Survey monitors the characteristics and development of childcare and early years providers and the workforce in England.  Information was collected on the number and characteristics of providers, the characteristics of the children enrolled, workforce composition, qualifications and training, recruitment and retention, and business operation. The 2016 survey underwent an extensive redesign, which means findings are not comparable with previous surveys.The 2020 survey was
cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic

The SL data have more restrictive access conditions than those made available under the standard End User Licence (EUL) agreement. Prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version.
