The current Parents' Survey series replaces two previous surveys: the Survey of Parents of Three and Four-Year-Old Children and Their Use of Early Years Services (conducted between 1997 and 2002) and Parents' Demand for Childcare, conducted in 1999 and 2001 (see SNs 4380 and 4970 respectively).

The Providers' Survey monitors the characteristics and development of childcare and early years providers and the workforce in England.  Information was collected on the number and characteristics of providers, the characteristics of the children enrolled, workforce composition, qualifications and training, recruitment and retention, and business operation. The 2016 survey underwent an extensive redesign, which means findings are not comparable with previous surveys.The 2020 survey was
cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic

Further information is available on the GOV.UK Childcare and Early Years Statistics webpage.Special licence dataAdditional, more detailed variables from the Providers' Survey in 2018, 2019 and 2021 are available under Special Licence (SL). The SL data have more restrictive access conditions than those made available under the standard End User Licence (EUL) agreement. Prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version. Users are advised to consult the EUL version first and the list of variables available under each study before applying.
The Childcare and Early Years Provision: Parents’ Survey, 2019 had two key objectives. The first was to provide salient, up-to date information on parents' use of childcare and early years provision, and their views and experiences of particular childcare providers and childcare provision in general. The second was to continue the time series - which has now been running for over ten years - on issues covered throughout the survey series.With respect to both these objectives, the study aims to provide information to help monitor the progress of policies in the area of childcare and early years education.  Further information about this study can be found on the GOV.UK Childcare and early years survey of parents: 2019 web page.
The survey covered the following topic areas:For all families: use of childcare in the reference term-time week and the past year; types of providers used for all children, and costs; use of and satisfaction with provision of childcare during school holidays in the past year (for families with school-age children); awareness, take-up, and impacts of entitlement to free early years provision for two-, three- and four-year olds; awareness and receipt of tax credits and subsidies; sources of information about local childcare; views on affordability, availability, flexibility and quality of childcare in the local area; and childcare and working arrangements.For one randomly selected child: detailed record of childcare attendance in the reference week; details of main provider for selected child; reasons for choosing the main provider; and the home learning environment.Classification details for all families: household composition; demographic characteristics (for example ethnicity, qualifications, income); parents' work history over the last two years (including any atypical working hours and whether this caused childcare problems); classification of children according to Special Educational Needs (SEN) and disability or long-standing illness; housing tenure; and contact details for childcare providers and administrative questions.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Childcare and Early Years Provision: Parents' Survey, 2019"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Childcare and Early Years Provision: Parents' Survey, 2019"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/childcare-and-early-years-provision-parents-survey-2019"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Childcare and Early Years Provision: Parents' Survey, 2019"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Childcare and Early Years Provision: Parents' Survey, 2019"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
