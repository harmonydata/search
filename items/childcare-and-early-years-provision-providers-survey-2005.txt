Families in England are randomly selected from the Child Benefit Records and all parents had children aged 0-14 years. They are asked about their use and experiences of childcare for all children in the family and to give more detailed information about childcare for a particular child (selected at random where there is more than one child in the family). The current Parents' Survey series replaces two previous surveys: the Survey of Parents of Three and Four-Year-Old Children and Their Use of Early Years Services (conducted between 1997 and 2002) and Parents' Demand for Childcare, conducted in 1999 and 2001 (see SNs 4380 and 4970 respectively).

The Providers' Survey monitors the characteristics and development of childcare and early years providers and the workforce in England.  Information was collected on the number and characteristics of providers, the characteristics of the children enrolled, workforce composition, qualifications and training, recruitment and retention, and business operation. The 2016 survey underwent an extensive redesign, which means findings are not comparable with previous surveys.The 2020 survey was
cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic

Further information is available on the GOV.UK Childcare and Early Years Statistics webpage.Special licence dataAdditional, more detailed variables from the Providers' Survey in 2018, 2019 and 2021 are available under Special Licence (SL). The SL data have more restrictive access conditions than those made available under the standard End User Licence (EUL) agreement. Prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version. Users are advised to consult the EUL version first and the list of variables available under each study before applying.
 The Childcare and Early Years Provision: Providers’ Survey, 2005 is the most recent survey in the series, aimed at tracking the characteristics and development of childcare

In order to reduce the time it took providers to complete the interview, a core set of questions were asked of all providers, and then the sample was randomly divided into two groups, one of which was asked questions in module A (costs and income) while the other group was asked questions in module B (training and recruitment). The same questionnaire was put to the group providers and a slightly different questionnaire was used for childminders.

The survey found that the structure of the childcare providers market was changing, having seen a reduction in numbers of sessional providers coupled with an increase in numbers of 'Full Day Care' providers. A substantial increase of out-of-school providers was also evident, as was a smaller decrease in numbers of registered childminders.
 The data cover: characteristics of childcare providers, including opening hours, number of places, ages, ethnicity of children attending; staff characteristics, including number of staff, demographics of paid staff, pay; training, including current level of training, training plans and budgets; qualifications, including qualifications held and worked towards by staff members; recruitment and retention, including level of recruitment, methods of recruitment and vacancies; income and expenditure, including costs, fees and funding.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Childcare and Early Years Provision: Providers' Survey, 2005"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Childcare and Early Years Provision: Providers' Survey, 2005"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/childcare-and-early-years-provision-providers-survey-2005"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Childcare and Early Years Provision: Providers' Survey, 2005"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Childcare and Early Years Provision: Providers' Survey, 2005"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
