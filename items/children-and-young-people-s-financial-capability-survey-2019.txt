their view on their child's skills, abilities, attitudes and behaviours with money.
The reports published so far from the 2019 survey can be found on the Money and Pensions Service Research webpage (Short Reports) and on the Money Advice Service Contributing Analysis Reports webpage.
The 2019 survey updates and builds on the previous 2016 Children and Young People's Financial Capability Survey (not currently held at the UK Data Service) and provides robust measures of children and young people's financial capability across the UK, including separate analysis for each devolved nation. (Reports from the 2016 survey are also available at the web link above.)
The survey includes questions around four topics:a. Financially capable behaviours: these are the behaviours that children and young people exhibit or the actions they take. Based on previous analysis, focus is on two key financially capable behaviours: Day to day money management and active saving.b. Financial enablers and inhibitors: these are the things that make financially capable behaviours either easier or more difficult for children and young people to achieve:
Connection, e.g. having responsibility for money
Mindset, e.g. having a saving mindset and shopping around 
Ability, e.g. skills and knowledge
c. Some external factors, which are also important drivers of financially capable behaviours
Financial means, i.e. receiving money, receiving it regularly, how much do they get.
Parental influences , i.e. parent sets rules around money

d. Demographics and other characteristics: both child and household characteristics including children's social-emotional, cognitive or behavioural skills.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Children and Young People's Financial Capability Survey, 2019"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Children and Young People's Financial Capability Survey, 2019"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/children-and-young-people-s-financial-capability-survey-2019"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Children and Young People's Financial Capability Survey, 2019"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Children and Young People's Financial Capability Survey, 2019"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
