People&#x27;s Inpatient
and Day Case Survey, 2014 / NHS Patient Survey Programme</title><meta name="description" content="The National Patient Survey Programme is one of the largest patient survey programmes in the world. It provides an opportunity to monitor experiences of health and provides data to assist with registration of trusts and monitoring on-going compliance. Understanding what people think about the care and treatment they receive is crucial to improving the quality of care being delivered by healthcare organisations. One way of doing this is by asking people who have recently used the health service to tell the Care Quality Commission (CQC) about their experiences.
The CQC will use the results from the surveys in the regulation, monitoring and inspection of NHS acute trusts (or, for community mental health service user surveys, providers of mental health services) in England. Data are used in CQC Insight, an intelligence tool which identifies potential changes in quality of care and then supports deciding on the right regulatory response. Survey data will also be used to support CQC inspections.

Each survey has a different focus. These include patients&#x27; experiences in outpatient and accident and emergency departments in Acute Trusts, and the experiences of people using mental health services in the community.

History of the programme
The National Patient Survey Programme began in 2002, and was then conducted by the Commission for Health Improvement (CHI), along with the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (CHAI). Administration of the programme was taken over by the Healthcare Commission in time for the 2004 series. On 1 April 2009, the CQC was formed, which replaced the Healthcare Commission.

Further information about the National Patient Survey Programme may be found on the CQC Patient Survey Programme web pages.

 The Children and Young People&#x27;s Inpatient and Day Case Survey, 2014 is the first national children&#x27;s survey conducted by CQC. It represents the experiences of nearly 19,000 children and young people who received inpatient or day case care in 137 acute NHS trusts in 2014.

 The questionnaire covered: admission; hospital wards; hospital staff; hospital food; facilities for parents and carers; pain management; operations and procedures; medicines; discharge and overall experience.

For anonymity and confidentiality reasons a number of variables have been removed or recoded: age / date of birth; gender; ethnicity; admission date; discharge date; length of stay; speciality on discharge; referring CCG; Treatment Centre Admission; route of admission; site of admission; site of discharge; information on longstanding conditions have all be removed. Number of overnight stays in past 6 months has been recoded to 1 and 2+.

In addition to this children and young people have been banded together as 8-15, rather than 8-11 and 12-15 and any questions unique to that version of the questionnaire removed due to low base sizes. Where fewer than 20 responses were received per trust, for any question asked to children, the data have been supressed within the dataset. 

Users should note that approval for the Children and Young People&#x27;s Inpatient and Day Case Survey, 2014 was obtained under Section 251 of the NHS Act 2006. This approval allows the common law duty of confidentiality to be put aside in order to enable the processing of patient identifiable information without consent. The approval granted does not allow the CQC to share any variables that have been removed from the dataset."/><meta property="og:title" content="Children and Young

the world. It provides an opportunity to monitor experiences of health and provides data to assist with registration of trusts and monitoring on-going compliance. Understanding what people think about the care and treatment they receive is crucial to improving the quality of care being delivered by healthcare organisations. One way of doing this is by asking people who have recently used the health service to tell the Care Quality Commission (CQC) about their experiences.\\nThe CQC will use the results from the surveys in the regulation, monitoring and inspection of NHS acute trusts (or, for community mental health service user surveys, providers of mental health services) in England. Data are used in CQC Insight, an intelligence tool which identifies potential changes in quality of care and then supports deciding on the right regulatory response. Survey data will also be used to support CQC inspections.\\n\\nEach survey has a different focus. These include patients' experiences in outpatient and accident and emergency departments in Acute Trusts, and the experiences of people using mental health services in the community.\\n\\nHistory of the programme\\nThe National Patient Survey Programme began in 2002, and was then conducted by the Commission for Health Improvement (CHI), along with the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (CHAI). Administration of the programme was taken over by the Healthcare Commission in time for the 2004 series.
