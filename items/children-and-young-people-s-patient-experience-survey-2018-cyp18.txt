For anonymity and confidentiality reasons a number of variables have been removed or recoded: age / date of birth; ethnicity; admission date; discharge date; length of stay; speciality on discharge; referring CCG; Treatment Centre Admission; route of admission; site of admission; site of discharge; information on longstanding conditions.

Trust question responses for a reporting age group have also been suppressed where there were fewer than 30 respondents for that question within a reporting age group (0 to 7, 8 to 11, or 12 to 15).

Users should note that approval for the Children and Young People's Patient Experience Survey, 2018 was obtained under Section 251 of the NHS Act 2006. This approval allows the common law duty of confidentiality to be put aside in order to enable the processing of patient identifiable information without consent. The approval granted does not allow the CQC to share any variables that have been removed from the dataset.1d:["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:description","content":"$2c"}]

2d:Te02,The National Patient Survey Programme is one of the largest patient survey programmes in the world. It provides an opportunity to monitor experiences of health and provides data to assist with registration of trusts and monitoring on-going compliance. Understanding what people think about the care and treatment they receive is crucial to improving the quality of care being delivered by healthcare organisations. One way of doing this is by asking people who have recently used the health service to tell the Care Quality Commission (CQC) about their experiences.
The CQC will use the results from the surveys in the regulation, monitoring and inspection of NHS acute trusts (or, for community mental health service user surveys, providers of mental health services) in England. Data are used in CQC Insight, an intelligence tool which identifies potential changes in quality of care and then supports deciding on the right regulatory response. Survey data will also be used to support CQC inspections.

Each survey has a different focus. These include patients' experiences in outpatient and accident and emergency departments in Acute Trusts, and the experiences of people using mental health services in the community.

History of the programme
The National Patient Survey Programme began in 2002, and was then conducted by the Commission for Health Improvement (CHI), along with the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (CHAI). Administration of the programme was taken over by the Healthcare Commission in time for the 2004 series. On 1 April 2009, the CQC was formed, which replaced the Healthcare Commission.

Further information about the National Patient Survey Programme may be found on the CQC Patient Survey Programme web pages.


The Children and Young People's Patient Experience Survey, 2018 is the third national children's survey conducted by CQC. It represents the experiences of nearly 33,179 children and young people who received inpatient or day case care in 129 acute and specialist NHS trusts in 2018. Further information can be found in the CQC document 2018 Children and Young People's Patient Experience Survey Statistical Release.
The questionnaire covered: admission; hospital wards; hospital staff; hospital food; facilities for parents and carers; pain management; operations and procedures;  discharge and overall experience.
For anonymity and confidentiality reasons a number of variables have been removed or recoded: age / date of birth; ethnicity; admission date; discharge date; length of stay; speciality on discharge; referring CCG; Treatment Centre Admission; route of admission; site of admission; site of discharge; information on longstanding conditions. Number of overnight stays in past 6 months has been recoded to 1 and 2+.

Where fewer than 20 responses were received per trust, across all reporting age groups, for any question asked to children, the data have been supressed within the dataset. Trust question responses for a reporting age group have also been suppressed where there were fewer than 30 respondents for that question within a reporting age group (0 to 7, 8 to 11, or 12 to 15).
