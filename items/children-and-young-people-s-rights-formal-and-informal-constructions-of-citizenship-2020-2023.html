Semi-structured interviews were conducted with Child Friendly practitioners in nine different cities in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States of America about the design and implementation of the UNICEF child friendly cities initiative and how it connects to other local authority initiatives. A questionnaire survey was also conducted across a sample of schools in Wales. As this survey was undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic, questions and responses provide a snapshot of the experiences of young people in Wales at this time. This survey also forms Sweep 8 of WISERD&#x27;s Multi-Cohort Study (WMCS), a longitudinal study of young people in Wales which commenced in 2013.WISERD celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. Over time it has grown into an international research institute that develops the next generation of research leaders. Our research brings together different disciplines (geographers, economists, sociologists, data scientists, political scientists) to address important issues for civil society at national and international levels. Our social science core provides a strong foundation for working with other disciplines including environmental science, engineering and medicine to transform our understanding and approaches to key areas of public concern. Our aim is to provide evidence that informs and changes policy and practice. This Centre will build on all previous WISERD research activities to undertake an ambitious new research programme. Our focus will be on the concept of civic stratification. This is a way of looking at divisions in society by focusing on the rights and obligations and practices of citizens and the role of civil society organisations in addressing inequalities in those rights and obligations. We will examine and analyse instances where people do not have the same rights as others (for example people who are migrants or refugees). We will also look at examples of people and groups working together within civil society to win new rights; this is referred to as civic expansion. Examples might include campaigns for animal rights or concerns about robots and Artificial Intelligence. We will investigate situations where people have the same rights but experience differences in their ability to access those rights; sometimes referred to as civic gain and civic loss (for example some people are better able to access legal services than others). Lastly, we will explore how individuals and groups come together to overcome deficits in their rights and citizenship; sometimes referred to as forms of civil repair. This might include ways in which people are looking at alternative forms of economic organisation, at local sustainability and at using new technologies (platforms and software) to organise and campaign for their rights. Our centre will deliver across four key areas of activity. First our research programme will focus on themes that address the different aspects of civic stratification. We will examine trends in polarization of economic, political and social rights, looking at how campaigns for rights are changing and undertaking case studies of attempts to repair the fabric of civil life. Second, we will extend and deepen our international and civil society research partnerships and networks and by doing so strengthen our foundations for developing further joint research in the future. Third, we will implement an exciting and accessible &#x27;knowledge exchange&#x27; programme to enable our research and evidence to reach, involve and influence as many people as possible. Fourth, we will expand the capacity of social science research and nurture future research leaders. All our research projects will be jointly undertaken with key partners including civil society organisations, such as charities, and local communities. The research programme is broad and will include the collection of new data, the exploitation of existing data sources and linking existing sets of data. The data will range from local detailed studies to large cross-national comparisons. We will make the most of our skills and abilities to work with major RCUK research investments. We have an outstanding track record in maximising research impact, in applying a wide range of research methods to real world problems.

and Young People’s Rights: Formal and Informal Constructions of Citizenship, 2020-2023\",\"description\":\"This project undertook a international comparison of the civic expansion of children’s rights in four Western countries (including Wales), and explored how this can rebalance the civic deficits associated with childhood. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with Child Friendly practitioners in nine different cities in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States of America about the design and implementation of the UNICEF child friendly cities initiative and how it connects to other local authority initiatives. A questionnaire survey was also conducted across a sample of schools in Wales. As this survey was undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic, questions and responses provide a snapshot of the experiences of young people in Wales at this time. This survey also forms Sweep 8 of WISERD's Multi-Cohort Study (WMCS), a longitudinal study of young people in Wales which commenced in 2013.WISERD celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. Over time it has grown into an international research institute that develops the next generation of research leaders. Our research brings together different disciplines (geographers, economists, sociologists, data scientists, political scientists) to address important issues for civil society at national and international levels. Our social science core provides a strong foundation for working with other disciplines including environmental science, engineering and medicine to transform our understanding and approaches to key areas of public concern. Our aim is to provide evidence that informs and changes policy and practice. This Centre will build on all previous WISERD research activities to undertake an ambitious new research programme. Our focus will be on the concept of civic stratification. This is a way of looking at divisions in society by focusing on the rights and obligations and practices of citizens and the role of civil society organisations in addressing inequalities in those rights and obligations. We will examine and analyse instances where people do not have the same rights as others (for example people who are migrants or refugees). We will also look at examples of people and groups working together within civil society to win new rights; this is referred to as civic expansion. Examples might include campaigns for animal rights or concerns about robots and Artificial Intelligence. We will investigate situations where people have the same rights but experience differences in their ability to access those rights; sometimes referred to as civic gain and civic loss (for example some people are better able to access legal services than others). Lastly, we will explore how individuals and groups come together to overcome deficits in their rights and citizenship; sometimes referred to as forms of civil repair. This might include ways in which people are looking at alternative forms of economic organisation, at local sustainability and at using new technologies (platforms and software) to organise and campaign for their rights. Our centre will deliver across four key areas of activity. First our research programme will focus on themes that address the different aspects of civic stratification. We will examine trends in polarization of economic, political and social rights, looking at how campaigns for rights are changing and undertaking case studies of attempts to repair the fabric of civil life. Second, we will extend and deepen our international and civil society research partnerships and networks and by doing so strengthen our foundations for developing further joint research in the future. Third, we will implement an exciting and accessible 'knowledge exchange' programme to enable our research and evidence to reach, involve and influence as many people as possible. Fourth, we will expand the capacity of social science research and nurture future research leaders. All our research projects will be jointly undertaken with key partners including civil society organisations, such as charities, and local communities. The research programme is broad and will include the collection of new data, the exploitation of existing data sources and linking existing sets of data. The data will range from local detailed studies to large cross-national comparisons. We will make the most of our skills and abilities to work with major RCUK research investments. We have an outstanding track record in maximising research impact, in applying a wide range of research methods to real world problems. This exciting and challenging research programme is based on a unique, long standing and supportive relationship between five core universities in Wales and our partnerships with universities and research institutes in the UK and internationally.\",\"url\":\"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/children-and-young-people-s-rights-formal-and-informal-constructions-of-citizenship-2020-2023\",\"keywords\":[\"EDUCATION\",\"SCHOOLS\",\"FRIENDSHIP\",\"DISCIPLINE\",\"BEHAVIOUR\",\"EMPLOYMENT\",\"PERSONAL QUALITIES\",\"ASPIRATION\",\"HOME LEARNING\",\"COVID-19\",\"CHILDREN'S RIGHTS\",\"CHILD-FRIENDLY CITIES\",\"LOCAL GOVERNMENT\",\"UNCRC\"],\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-857598\"],\"includedInDataCatalog\":[{\"@type\":\"DataCatalog\",\"name\":\"UK Data Service\",\"url\":\"https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=857598\"}],\"sponsor\":[{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"Economic and Social Research Council\"}],\"temporalCoverage\":\"2020-05-01/2023-02-28\"}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"14:T1295,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"This project undertook a international comparison of the civic expansion of children’s rights in four Western countries (including Wales), and explored how this can rebalance the civic deficits associated with childhood.
