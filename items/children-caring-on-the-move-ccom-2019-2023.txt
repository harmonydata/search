Little is known about separated children’s care for each other as they navigate contradictory, complex, and changeable immigration and welfare systems. Nor has it been well understood how separated children’s care for each other is understood and treated by relevant adult stakeholder. We carried out a total of 75 interviews with 38 unaccompanied young people in two major cities. The interviews were led by a group of Young Researchers who were trained by the university research team with participatory and interview methods. For each interview the Young Research was accompanied by a member of the university research team. Each young person was invited to 2-3 interviews over a 6-12 month period. These included (i) object-based interviews where participants were asked to bring an object that represents care; (ii) photo elicitation focused on a ‘day in the life’ of the participant; and (iii) walking interviews to see places of (un)caring. We conducted 63 semi-structured interviews with adult participants about their understandings practices of and perspectives on care. They include Project Coordinators (in Education/Charity), Project Managers (in Education/Charity, State Social Work, Arts in Charity, NGO sectors) and ‘Direct workers’ (e.g., Charity advocates, state and independent social workers, foster carers, educators, paediatricians and educators), mental health/therapy (working in NGO settings), interpreters, immigration lawyers and border force.

This project sits against the backdrop of the displacement of over 65.6 million people globally, many of whom are children. Whilst some have moved with adult family members, the number who have been separated from primary carers at some point during their migration journeys has risen dramatically (Unicef, 2016). Often referred to as 'unaccompanied minors' in legal and policy contexts, we use the term 'separated child migrants' to highlight that many children maintain transnational relationships or reunite with parents at various points in the migration process, and are often accompanied by other kin and non-kin adults and children (Rosen, forthcoming).

When separated migrant children arrive in the UK, they face conflicting treatment. They are protected as 'children' and entitled to the same rights to care as all other children. But, they are often treated as 'suspect' and excluded from welfare provision because of their status as 'migrants' (Crafter, forthcoming). Previous research has highlighted that the tension between immigration control and protection has led to significant differences in the quality of care provided for separated migrant children. New policy and guidance about separated migrant children is both responding to and changing the way these tensions are handled in the UK with, as yet, unknown consequences. In any case, they do not take children's care for each other into account.

Little is known about separated children's care for each other as they navigate contradictory, complex, and changeable immigration and welfare systems.18:T1244,The Children Caring on the Move project has generated knowledge that both analyses and provides ways to address one of the greatest global challenges of our time: the care and well-being of children affected by transnational displacement and migration. This project offers insights into the care of unaccompanied migrant young people in England, starting from the premise that care is not necessarily limited to that provided by an adult or the state. Little is known about separated children’s care for each other as they navigate contradictory, complex, and changeable immigration and welfare systems. Nor has it been well understood how separated children’s care for each other is understood and treated by relevant adult stakeholder. We carried out a total of 75 interviews with 38 unaccompanied young people in two major cities. The interviews were led by a group of Young Researchers who were trained by the university research team with participatory and interview methods. For each interview the Young Research was accompanied by a member of the university research team. Each young person was invited to 2-3 interviews over a 6-12 month period. These included (i) object-based interviews where participants were asked to bring an object that represents care; (ii) photo elicitation focused on a ‘day in the life’ of the participant; and (iii) walking interviews to see places of (un)caring. We conducted 63 semi-structured interviews with adult participants about their understandings practices of and perspectives on care. They include Project Coordinators (in Education/Charity), Project Managers (in Education/Charity, State Social Work, Arts in Charity, NGO sectors) and ‘Direct workers’ (e.g., Charity advocates, state and independent social workers, foster carers, educators, paediatricians and educators), mental health/therapy (working in NGO settings), interpreters, immigration lawyers and border force. A further series of interviews focused on (semi-)independent accommodation: 15 interviews with company directors or managers. For ethical reasons, some transcripts were redacted from this data collection.The promise of this project lies in generating knowledge that both analyses and provides ways to address one of the greatest global challenges of our time: the care and well-being of children affected by transnational displacement and migration. It will offer insights into the care of separated migrant children in England, starting from the premise that care is not necessarily limited to that provided by an adult or the state. Our pilot studies demonstrate that a crucial way separated migrant children survive the challenges of migration and settlement is through the care they provide and receive from other migrant children. Using creative research methods designed to involve separated migrant children and adult stakeholders in reflecting on their understandings and experiences of care, this project will not only point to 'cracks in the system' (Rosen et al., 2017) but offer insights into what constitutes good practice and how to develop it.
