The first data collection took place when the cohort members were nine months old. The final data collection will be when the children are age five.There will be a big focus on linking administrative data to the survey data we collect. With participants’ consent, we will link education data, held by the Department for Education, and NHS digital health records to the study data.The survey data we collect will be enriched with in-home observation and smartphone apps.
