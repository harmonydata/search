Study collaborators include the UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies, the University of Oxford, and Birkbeck, University of London.  Data from Wave 1 of the Children of the 2020s study are available for research purposes via the ONS Secure Research Service.Researchers who wish to use Children of the 2020s data will need to become an accredited researcher, and then apply for an accredited research project.The Wave 1 Technical Report is available from the Department for Education website. It includes the questionnaire content as well as a description of the development, implementation, administration, and data management of the first wave of the survey.If you’ve been contacted to take part in Children of the 2020s, please head to the study website to find out more about what the study involves.The Children of the 2020s study sample has been drawn from HMRC Child Benefit records.

London WC1H 0ALEmail: clsdata@ucl.ac.uk15:T5c5,The Children of the 2020s study is a nationally representative birth cohort study in England, focusing on babies born at the start of the 2020s. Commissioned by the Department for Education, the study aims to explore the family, early education, and childcare factors that influence early school success. Led by Professor Pasco Fearon, the study involves collaboration with several institutions, including UCL, the University of Cambridge, and Ipsos.

The study's sample is drawn from HMRC Child Benefit records, targeting babies born in September, October, and November 2021, with approximately 8,500 families invited to participate. It is a five-wave longitudinal survey tracking children from nine months to five years old. The first wave of data collection occurred when the children were nine months old, with subsequent waves planned at ages two, three, four, and five.

Data collection methods include face-to-face interviews, online and telephone surveys, and the use of a smartphone app called BabySteps to gather developmental and home environment data. The study also plans to link survey data with education and health records, with participants' consent.

The study's findings are expected to provide valuable insights into early childhood development and inform policy decisions related to education and childcare. Data from the study is available for research purposes through the ONS Secure Research Service, and researchers must become accredited to access it.a:[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$12"}}],["$","$L13",null,{"dataset":{"title":"Children of the 2020s study","description":"$14","image":"$undefined","publisher":"$undefined","funders":"$undefined","geographicCoverage":"UK","temporalCoverage":"$undefined","ageCoverage":"$undefined","studyDesign":["longitudinal","survey","geo","birth","cohort","panel","administrative"],"resourceType":"study","topics":[],"instruments":[],"dataCatalogs":[{"name":"UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies","url":"https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/","logo":"$undefined"}],"matchedVariables":[],"allVariables":[],"additionalLinks":["https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/children-of-the-2020s-study/"],"child_datasets":[],"aiSummary":"$15"}}]]
