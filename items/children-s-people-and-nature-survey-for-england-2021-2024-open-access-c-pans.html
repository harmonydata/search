Each year, the survey samples around 4,000 children and young people aged 8 -15 years across two survey waves, one in term time and one in holiday time.Waves 5 and 6 of the C-PaNS ran between 
the 16 and 23 August 2023 (during the school holidays) and 18 and 26 
September 2023 (during term-time). Wave 7 and 8 ran between the 14 and 25 August 2024 (during the school holidays) and the 16 September and 2 October 2024 (during the term-time). These data are alongside data from earlier waves already published.Different versions of the C-PaNS are available from the 
UK Data Archive under Open Access (SN 9174) conditions, End User Licence
 (SN 9175), and Secure Access (SN 9176).The Secure Access version
 includes the same data as the End User Licence version, but includes 
more detailed variables including:age as a continuous variableincome (all categories)number of people living in household as a continuous variableethnicitydisabilityhome geography variables, including local authority district and urban/rural areaopen answers for thematic analysis in CS_Q14 and CS_Q15The Open Access version includes the same data as the End User Licence version, but does not include the following variables:age bandnumber of people living in household (Top coded to ‘6 and over’)access to private gardenincome (top coded to £50,000+)genderplaces withing walking distance from home Researchers
 are advised to review the Open Access and/or the End User Licence

producers of official statistics should adhere to. These 
accredited official statistics were independently reviewed by the Office

standards of trustworthiness, quality and value in the Code of Practice

 the latest review by the Office for Statistics Regulation, Natural 
England have continued to comply with the Code of Practice for

 estimates of the percentage of people visiting nature in the previous 
14 days by reducing the amount of respondents answering ‘don’t know’.These data are available in Excel, SPSS, as well as Open Document Spreadsheet (ODS) formats.
