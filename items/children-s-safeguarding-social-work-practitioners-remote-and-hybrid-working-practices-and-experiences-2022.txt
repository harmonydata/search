This project aimed to:
Document how service leaders, supervisors, social workers and service users described agile working
Identify practitioners’, supervisors’ and service users’ practices, relationships and experiences when engaged in agile working
Examine how these identified practices impact on social workers’ and service users’ communication and sense-making
Develop evidence about good working practices in these contexts.
The project took place from April 2020 to August 2022.  During the first part of this period, most social work practice was remote, moving towards a hybrid of remote and co-present practices, often supported by digital technologies.
Three local authorities in different regions of England took part in the project.  21 practitioners participated in the study, being interviewed regularly over the course of 6-12 months about their practices, relationships and experiences.  Examples of participants' everyday working practices — meetings, supervision sessions, and conversations with service users — were also observed, with most of these being online, remote practices.  14 service leaders were interviewed about how and why agile approaches were being designed and implemented.  18 young people and parents who had used children's safeguarding social work services also participated through individual interviews and focus groups.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Children’s Safeguarding Social Work Practitioners: Remote and Hybrid Working Practices and Experiences, 2022"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Children’s Safeguarding Social Work Practitioners: Remote and Hybrid Working Practices and Experiences, 2022"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/children-s-safeguarding-social-work-practitioners-remote-and-hybrid-working-practices-and-experiences-2022"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Children’s Safeguarding Social Work Practitioners: Remote and Hybrid Working Practices and Experiences, 2022"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Children’s Safeguarding Social Work Practitioners: Remote and Hybrid Working Practices and Experiences, 2022"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
