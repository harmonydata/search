The study was implemented in collaboration with the Refugee Council and benefited from the support of an advisory committee which included members of refugee community organisations.

Stage 2 consisted of a survey conducted in two London schools with refugee and non-refugee children aged 11-13 years, focusing on their social roles and social networks. Users should note that the Data Archive only holds data from Stage 2 of the research (the questionnaire).The objectives of the study were:using a case study approach (Stage 1 of the research), to contribute to knowledge of the lives of refugee children, and by doing so to advance the theoretical study of children as social actors;to provide information useful to policy makers and others concerned with the welfare of refugee families, both children and parents.The research questions were structured around the areas of refugee children's experience in their families and in peer group networks, refugee children as users of services, and the children's expectations of the future.  The questionnaire was structured around personal details and self-identity, family and home, friendship networks, school life, leisure pursuits, feelings and emotions and future outlook.26:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2a"}]
