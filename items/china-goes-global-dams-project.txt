As China’s rapid economic growth has created a series of pressures, such as depletion of scarce domestic resources, the country is engaging more closely with low and middle income countries in Asia and Africa. Access to overseas natural resources, new markets and technological advances, have made China the world’s largest player in large hydropower dam projects, usually backed by state finance and state-owned enterprises.

The project therefore aims to provide the first systematic and comparative analysis of the social, economic, environmental and political impacts of Chinese hydropower dam projects in low and middle income countries.The project involves detailed empirical research - including interviews and focus group consultations - at four dam sites in Cambodia, Malaysia, Ghana and Nigeria which represent different facets of China's dams in the global South.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"China goes global dams project"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"China goes global dams project"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/china-goes-global-dams-project"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"China goes global dams project"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"China goes global dams project"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
