2)	What are the ideological factors that shape the formation of FLPs and to what extent does the dynamic interrelationship between FLP and other social forces, including macro-national/political and meso-educational language policies, influence the decision making processes of FLP?

4)	How do similarities and differences between communities with regard to migration histories, linguistic environments, cultural conditions, and socio-political system affect the decision making processes in families?
