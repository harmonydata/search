Choices included (1) maintenance service provider (public, private), (2) guaranteed days for repairs (2, 4, 6, 8), (3) cash management (treasurer/cash, bank account, mobile money), (4) monthly household payment (USD 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0). An orthogonal, main effects design generated 10 choice cards, each with two alternatives and a status quo option eliciting 10 choice responses. Participating households could also select a status quo option reflecting community maintenance and the local payment arrangements (commonly cash). The data is presented as prepared for a conditional logit model estimating the main attributes followed by interactions across four hypotheses of behavioural change: (a) multidimensional wealth, (b) education, (c) gender of respondent, and (d) household concerns.

Africa's groundwater systems are a critical but poorly understood socio-ecological system. Explosive urban growth, irrigated agricultural expansion, industrial pollution, untapped mineral wealth, rural neglect and environmental risks often converge to increase the complexity and urgency of governance challenges across Africa's groundwater systems. These Africa-wide opportunities and trade-offs are reflected in Kenya where the government's unifying Vision 2030 aims to double the irrigated agricultural area whilst simultaneously promoting the growth of high-value mineral resources. Institutional capacity to govern interactions between economic activities, water resource demands and poverty outcomes are currently constrained by insufficient knowledge and lack of effective management tools. The overarching project aim is to design, test and transfer a novel, interdisciplinary and replicable Groundwater Risk Management tool to improve governance transformations to balance economic growth, groundwater sustainability and human development trade-offs.18:T1036,This record contains information on two water service choice experiments.

Experiment 1 – Published in Nature for Clean Water (Npj). For this experiment the record contains data collected from 1,560 households in Kwale county on the south coast of Kenya. A sample of 531 handpump locations was used as a sampling frame for a household survey administered in late 2013 and early 2014. 3,500 households took part in this survey of which a random draw of 1,560 households were selected to take part in a choice experiment on water service preferences. Choices included (1) maintenance service provider (public, private), (2) guaranteed days for repairs (2, 4, 6, 8), (3) cash management (treasurer/cash, bank account, mobile money), (4) monthly household payment (USD 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0). An orthogonal, main effects design generated 10 choice cards, each with two alternatives and a status quo option eliciting 10 choice responses. Participating households could also select a status quo option reflecting community maintenance and the local payment arrangements (commonly cash). The data is presented as prepared for a conditional logit model estimating the main attributes followed by interactions across four hypotheses of behavioural change: (a) multidimensional wealth, (b) education, (c) gender of respondent, and (d) household concerns. The read-me-Npj file describes steps required for estimation of the econometric latent class model specified by a discrete distribution of preferences to estimate heterogeneity.

Experiment 2 – Published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). For this experiment the record contains data collected from 1,185 households in Kwale county on the south coast of Kenya. A sample of 531 handpump locations was used as a sampling frame for a household survey administered in late 2013 and early 2014. 3,500 households took part in this survey of which a random draw of 1,185 households were selected to take part in a choice experiment on water service preferences. Choices included (1)reliability in days to repair pump (2, 4, 6, 8), (2) drinking water quality (potable, non-potable), (3) distance to handpump (current distance, half of current distance),(4) monthly household payment (USD 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0). An orthogonal, main effects design generated 10 choice cards, each with two alternatives and a status quo option eliciting 10 choice responses. Participating households could also select a status quo option. The data is presented as prepared for a conditional logit model estimating the main attributes followed by interactions across three hypotheses of behavioural change: (a) multidimensional wealth, (b) gender of respondent, (c), and household concerns. The read-me-PNAS file describes steps required for estimation of the econometric latent class model specified by a discrete distribution of preferences to estimate heterogeneity.Improved understanding of groundwater risks and institutional responses against competing growth and development goals is central to accelerating and sustaining Africa's development.
