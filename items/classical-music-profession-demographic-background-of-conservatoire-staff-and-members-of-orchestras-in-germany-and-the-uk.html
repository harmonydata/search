This project aims to add to our understanding of cultural work by conducting research on the classical music profession in Berlin and London.

The study generated new knowledge in three key areas. First, it contributed to our understanding of inequalities in the classical music profession. Given the dearth of data on the demographic background of classical musicians, the study collected quantitative data on the backgrounds of orchestral players and conservatoire teachers. It complemented these quantitative findings with in-depth study of existing qualitative data on the ways in which musicians make sense of on-going inequalities and how particular industry practices, such as the emphasis placed on self-promotion, disadvantage women.

The study identified ten different ways in which the research participants took on an entrepreneurial outlook by, for example, talking about themselves as a ‘commodity’ that has to be marketed.
