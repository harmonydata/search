This will be done through three work packages. This first (Identifying Church and Community Climate Adaptation and Resilience Stories) will develop the researchers understanding of the climate risk that the church faces. It will do this through a comprehensive literature review and gathering case studies from churches around the UK; examples in which the church building itself is at risk and required adaptation measures (e.g. protection against flooding, stonework damage) and examples where the church creates community climate resilience in at-risk areas (e.g. protection from flooding, over-heating). 

The second (Co-Production of Church Centred Climate Resilience) builds on this through a series of co-productive workshops with local stakeholders and diocese workers to build on these finding and ensure the outputs of this work reflects the communities it is producing guidance for.

Thirdly (Guidance Creation and Reporting) will utilise these findings to create internal guidance notes that will actively contribute to the work of the CCB as well as contributing to the Church of England's wider environmental plan and creating new online resources. Guidance notes and academic papers will be disseminated more widely through other heritage and faith bodies, as well as academic journals. 

This project has an extensive dissemination plan and will be able to share new research (in the form of short case studies, online resources, and videos) through the Church of England, through regional workshops with diocesan staff, conferences, and website / social media. Churches and communities around the country will increase climate literacy and capacity to undertake new approaches to climate change resilience and adaptation in their community. This project has a potential audience of thousands as the Church of England continues to promote environmental issues, of which this work would be a key part, across the countrye:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Climate Resilient Churches, 2021-2023"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$15"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Climate Resilient Churches, 2021-2023"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/climate-resilient-churches-2021-2023"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Climate Resilient Churches, 2021-2023"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Climate Resilient Churches, 2021-2023"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
