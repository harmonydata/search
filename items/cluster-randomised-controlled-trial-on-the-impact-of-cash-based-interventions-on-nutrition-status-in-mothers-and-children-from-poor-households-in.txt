The aim of REFANI is to ensure more effective humanitarian interventions by strengthening the evidence base on the impact of cash and voucher-based food assistance to prevent under nutrition in emergencies.
The main objectives are to:

Cash-based interventions (CBIs) (cash and vouchers), offer an interesting opportunity to prevent increases in wasting in humanitarian settings. However, there is a dearth of evidence as to the impact of CBIs on nutrition status in emergency settings.
