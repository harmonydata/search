when data showed that despite being just 3.5% of the population in
England, Black people comprised 5.8% of those who died from the
virus; whereas White people, comprising 85.3% of the population,
were 73.6% of those who died. The disproportionate impact
continued with, for example, over-policing: 32% of stop and search
in the year ending March 2021 were of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) males aged 15-34, despite them being just 2.6% of the population.

The emergency measures introduced to govern the pandemic
worked together to create a damaging cycle affecting Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic families and communities of all ages. Key-workers – often stopped by police on their way to provide essential services – could not furlough or work from home to avoid infection, nor support their children in home-schooling. Children in high-occupancy homes lacked adequate space and/ or equipment to learn; such homes also lacked leisure space for key workers to restore themselves after extended hours at work.
Over-policing instilled fear across the generations and deterred
BAME people – including the mobile elderly - from leaving crowded
homes for legitimate exercise, and those that did faced the risk of
receiving a Fixed Penalty Notice and a criminal record.

These insights arose from research by Co-POWeR into the
synergistic effects of emergency measures on policing, child
welfare, caring, physical activity and nutrition. Using community
engagement, a survey with 1000 participants and interviews, focus
groups, participatory workshops and community testimony days
with over 400 people in total, we explored the combined impact
of COVID-19 and discrimination on wellbeing and resilience across
BAME FC in the UK. This policy note crystallises our findings into
a framework of recommendations relating to arts and media
communications, systems and structures, community and
individual well-being and resilience. We promote long term
actions rather than short term reactions. 

In brief, we conclude that ignoring race, gender and class when tackling a pandemic can undermine not only wellbeing across Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic families and communities (BAME FC) but also their levels of trust in government. A framework to protect wellbeing and resilience in BAME FC during public health emergencies was developed by Co-POWeR to ensure that laws and guidance adopted are culturally competent.Two viruses - COVID-19 and discrimination - are currently killing in the UK (Solanke 2020), especially within BAMEFC who are hardest hit. Survivors face ongoing damage to wellbeing and resilience, in terms of physical and mental health as well as social, cultural and economic (non-medical) consequences. Psychosocial (ADCS 2020; The Children&#x27;s Society 2020)/ physical trauma of those diseased and deceased, disproportionate job-loss (Hu 2020) multigenerational housing, disrupted care chains (Rai 2016) lack of access to culture, education and exercise, poor nutrition, &#x27;over-policing&#x27; (BigBrotherWatch 2020) hit BAMEFC severely. Local &#x27;lockdowns&#x27; illustrate how easily BAMEFC become subject to stigmatization and discrimination through &#x27;mis-infodemics&#x27; (IOM 2020). The impact of these viruses cause long-term poor outcomes. While systemic deficiencies have stimulated BAMEFC agency, producing solidarity under emergency, BAMEFC vulnerability remains, requiring official support. 
The issues are complex thus we focus on the interlinked and &#x27;intersectional nature of forms of exclusion and disadvantage&#x27;, operationalised through the idea of a &#x27;cycle of wellbeing and resilience&#x27; (CWAR) which recognises how COVID-19 places significant stress upon BAMEFC structures and the impact of COVID-19 and discrimination on different BAMEFC cohorts across the UK, in whose lives existing health inequalities are compounded by a myriad of structural inequalities. Given the prevalence of multi-generational households, BAMEFC are likely to experience these as a complex of jostling over-lapping stressors: over-policed unemployed young adults are more likely to live with keyworkers using public transport to attend jobs in the front line, serving elders as formal/informal carers, neglecting their health thus exacerbating co-morbidities and struggling to feed children who are unable to attend school, resulting in nutritional and digital deprivation.

A framework to protect wellbeing and resilience in BAME FC during public health emergencies was developed by Co-POWeR to ensure that laws and guidance adopted are culturally competent.Two viruses - COVID-19 and discrimination - are currently killing in the UK (Solanke 2020), especially within BAMEFC who are hardest hit. Survivors face ongoing damage to wellbeing and resilience, in terms of physical and mental health as well as social, cultural and economic (non-medical) consequences. Psychosocial (ADCS 2020; The Children's Society 2020)/ physical trauma of those diseased and deceased, disproportionate job-loss (Hu 2020) multigenerational housing, disrupted care chains (Rai 2016) lack of access to culture, education and exercise, poor nutrition, 'over-policing' (BigBrotherWatch 2020) hit BAMEFC severely. Local 'lockdowns' illustrate how easily BAMEFC become subject to stigmatization and discrimination through 'mis-infodemics' (IOM 2020). The impact of these viruses cause long-term poor outcomes.

Given the prevalence of multi-generational households, BAMEFC are likely to experience these as a complex of jostling over-lapping stressors: over-policed unemployed young adults are more likely to live with keyworkers using public transport to attend jobs in the front line, serving elders as formal/informal carers, neglecting their health thus exacerbating co-morbidities and struggling to feed children who are unable to attend school, resulting in nutritional and digital deprivation. \\nHistorical research shows race/class dimensions to national emergencies (e.g. Hurricane Katrina) but most research focuses on the COVID-19 experience of white families/communities.\",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/co-power-consortium-on-practices-of-wellbeing-and-resilience-in-black-asian-and-minority-ethnic-families-and-communities-2023\",\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-856500\"],\"keywords\":[\"SEXUAL AND GENDER GROUPS\",\"ETHNIC GROUPS\",\"COVID-19\",\"RACISM\",\"CHILDREN\",\"SOCIAL CLASS\",\"TRUST IN GOVERNMENT\"],\"temporalCoverage\":\"2021-02-12/2023-02-11\"}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"c:[\"$\",\"$5\",null,{\"fallback\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":\"Loading...\"}],\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$L17\",null,{\"strategy\":\"beforeInteractive\",\"id\":\"structured-data\",\"type\":\"application/ld+json\",\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"$18\"}}],\"$L19\"]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1a:I[78977,[\"9692\",\"static/js/9692.83f9877c.js\",\"1828\",\"static/js/1828.31087444.js\",\"690\",\"static/js/690.e023e61b.js\",\"7133\",\"static/js/7133.521b2ecd.js\",\"9829\",\"static/js/9829.124a89b0.js\",\"867\",\"static/js/867.7f6bef5e.js\",\"2939\",\"static/js/2939.aa50df5c.js\",\"5183\",\"static/js/5183.9f1a7545.js\",\"5738\",\"static/js/5738.d28a9943.js\",\"3055\",\"static/js/3055.87b66c06.js\",\"8977\",\"static/js/8977.89625695.js\",\"6387\",\"static/js/app/items/%5Bslug%5D/page.cedc9485.js\"],\"default\"]\n1b:T1208,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"The inequities of the COVID-19 pandemic were clear by April 2020\nwhen data showed that despite being just 3.5% of the population in\nEngland, Black people comprised 5.8% of those who died from the\nvirus; whereas White people, comprising 85.3% of the population,\nwere 73.6% of those who died.

The disproportionate impact\ncontinued with, for example, over-policing: 32% of stop and search\nin the year ending March 2021 were of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) males aged 15-34, despite them being just 2.6% of the population.\n\nThe emergency measures introduced to govern the pandemic\nworked together to create a damaging cycle affecting Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic families and communities of all ages. Key-workers – often stopped by police on their way to provide essential services – could not furlough or work from home to avoid infection, nor support their children in home-schooling. Children in high-occupancy homes lacked adequate space and/ or equipment to learn; such homes also lacked leisure space for key workers to restore themselves after extended hours at work.\nOver-policing instilled fear across the generations and deterred\nBAME people – including the mobile elderly - from leaving crowded\nhomes for legitimate exercise, and those that did faced the risk of\nreceiving a Fixed Penalty Notice and a criminal record.\n\nThese insights arose from research by Co-POWeR into the\nsynergistic effects of emergency measures on policing, child\nwelfare, caring, physical activity and nutrition. Using community\nengagement, a survey with 1000 participants and interviews, focus\ngroups, participatory workshops and community testimony days\nwith over 400 people in total, we explored the combined impact\nof COVID-19 and discrimination on wellbeing and resilience across\nBAME FC in the UK. This policy note crystallises our findings into\na framework of recommendations relating to arts and media\ncommunications, systems and structures, community and\nindividual well-being and resilience. We promote long term\nactions rather than short term reactions. \n\nIn brief, we conclude that ignoring race, gender and class when tackling a pandemic can undermine not only wellbeing across Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic families and communities (BAME FC) but also their levels of trust in government. A framework to protect wellbeing and resilience in BAME FC during public health emergencies was developed by Co-POWeR to ensure that laws and guidance adopted are culturally competent.Two viruses - COVID-19 and discrimination - are currently killing in the UK (Solanke 2020), especially within BAMEFC who are hardest hit. Survivors face ongoing damage to wellbeing and resilience, in terms of physical and mental health as well as social, cultural and economic (non-medical) consequences. Psychosocial (ADCS 2020; The Children's Society 2020)/ physical trauma of those diseased and deceased, disproportionate job-loss (Hu 2020) multigenerational housing, disrupted care chains (Rai 2016) lack of access to culture, education and exercise, poor nutrition, 'over-policing' (BigBrotherWatch 2020) hit BAMEFC severely. Local 'lockdowns' illustrate how easily BAMEFC become subject to stigmatization and discrimination through 'mis-infodemics' (IOM 2020). The impact of these viruses cause long-term poor outcomes. While systemic deficiencies have stimulated BAMEFC agency, producing solidarity under emergency, BAMEFC vulnerability remains, requiring official support. \nThe issues are complex thus we focus on the interlinked and 'intersectional nature of forms of exclusion and disadvantage', operationalised through the idea of a 'cycle of wellbeing and resilience' (CWAR) which recognises how COVID-19 places significant stress upon BAMEFC structures and the impact of COVID-19 and discrimination on different BAMEFC cohorts across the UK, in whose lives existing health inequalities are compounded by a myriad of structural inequalities.
