2b:T839,This code merges multiple years of Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW) and/or the British Crime Survey (BCS). The purpose of these code is to help researchers to quickly and easily combine multiple survey sweeps of the CSEW and BCS.
By combining multiple survey sweeps, people are able to look at, for instance, trends in violence. Furthermore, using such a combined file enables you to look at specific offences, population groups, or consequences, that do not have a high enough frequency if you would use only a single year. 

This is a Stata do file, access to Stata is therefore required, as is access to all the BCS and CSEW that you want to merge. In specifying the code, you can decide which files you want to merge. Namely, which years of the Crime Surveys you want to merge and if you want the bolt-on datasets that provide uncapped codes, the adolescent and young adult panels, and/or if you want to use the ‘non-white’ panel. This code does not harmonize variables that are different between years.
