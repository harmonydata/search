It captures important information every year about the social and economic circumstances, attitudes, behaviours and health of people living in thousands of UK households.

Information from the longitudinal survey is primarily used by academics, researchers and policy makers in their work, but the findings are of interest to a much wider group of people including those working in the third sector, health practitioners, business, the media and the general public.

Interviews began in 2009 with eligible members of nearly 32,000 selected households invited to take part. Adults are interviewed and 10-15 year-olds fill in a paper self-completion questionnaire. New people join the study as they join the households of existing members, and if members leave their households, all adult members of their new household are interviewed. In 2010-11, some 20,000 participants aged over 16 also received nurse visits and provided a blood sample and some basic physical measurements (height, weight, blood pressure, grip strength). Data collection is annual, but each wave takes place over a two year period, with the second year of one wave overlapping the first year of the subsequent wave (so wave 1 took place between 2009 and 2011, wave 2 between 2010 and 2012, and so forth). 

A further 8,000 households from the British Household Panel Survey (see below) were invited to join at wave 2.

An additional 1,500 UK households are interviewed for the Innovation Panel, a separate annual survey which is used by researchers as a test bed for new ways of collecting data or exploring new topics before they become part of the main survey.

UKHLS also has an ethnicity strand, with boost samples to ensure the study had at least 1,000 adults from the five main ethnicity groups in the UK. There are also extra questions asked each year of particular relevance to ethnic groups. In 2015, a further immigrant and ethnic boost sample was added to the study.

This collection consists of project R code written to (1) extract and then (2) combine data from across the various files of BHPS and UKHLS into one ‘master’ longitudinal dataset containing annual records for all observed individuals from 1991 to 2020. A number of key individual and household-level variables (including age, sex, country of birth, partnership status, highest educational qualification, employment status, incomes and region) are then (3) cleaned and harmonised. 

Users can download and adapt the deposited code as needed for their own social science applications.The Modelling Housing Career Trajectories in Great Britain project aimed to develop our understanding of how people's pathways through the housing market are changing in 21st Century Britain. To do this, one strand of empirical research used UK household panel survey data (the British Household Panel Survey and its successor, Understanding Society) to examine housing career pathways and homeownership transitions since the 1990s. 

This collection contains R code written to (1) extract BHPS and Understanding Society data, (2) combine various data files from the two collections and (3) produce a basic set of harmonised BHSP-Understanding Society variables to support longitudinal analysis covering the 1991-present period. Users can download and adapt the code for their own research projects.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Code to Create a Combined British Household Panel Survey and Understanding Society Data File, 1991-2020"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Code to Create a Combined British Household Panel Survey and Understanding Society Data File, 1991-2020"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/code-to-create-a-combined-british-household-panel-survey-and-understanding-society-data-file-1991-2020"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Code to Create a Combined British Household Panel Survey and Understanding Society Data File, 1991-2020"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Code to Create a Combined British Household Panel Survey and Understanding Society Data File, 1991-2020"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
