CBM encourages people to develop alternative ways of interpreting difficult thoughts (i.e. “someone is watching me”), leading participants to change their understanding of what these situations might mean.
CBM is used in anxiety 62,21, but has not been appropriately applied together disorders. Our version, CBM-pa, was developed with service user input. It is based on new research into the biases that people with paranoia have when interpreting events 61. It involves participants reading stories on a computer screen, completing missing words and answering questions about each story in a way that encourages more helpful beliefs about themselves and others. After one session of CBM-pa, people with
paranoia displayed a range of helpful effects, including significant belief change, and less distress in ambiguous social situations.
This study will test whether, in addition to usual treatment, six sessions of CBM-pa produces significant benefit for patients (for example by reducing symptoms and distress) immediately, and at 1 and 3 month follow-up, compared to reading passages of text alone. Eight participants will be interviewed in more depth about their experiences. The overall aim is to test whether CBM-pa could be an effective treatment for paranoia. If so, CBM-pa would have a number of potential advantages over other approaches, including, minimal effort to complete, no homework, no therapist, and portability.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Cognitive bias modification for paranoia, feasibility study: Main and interim datasets 2015-2017"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Cognitive bias modification for paranoia, feasibility study: Main and interim datasets 2015-2017"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/cognitive-bias-modification-for-paranoia-feasibility-study-main-and-interim-datasets-2015-2017"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Cognitive bias modification for paranoia, feasibility study: Main and interim datasets 2015-2017"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Cognitive bias modification for paranoia, feasibility study: Main and interim datasets 2015-2017"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
