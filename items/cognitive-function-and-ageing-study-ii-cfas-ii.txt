Conducted between 2008 and 2011, CFAS II focuses on individuals aged 65-84, providing baseline data for a cohort expected to experience significant frailty in the 2020s. This study aims to understand the implications of aging on health, service use, and healthcare expenditure, particularly in anticipation of potential therapeutic interventions for dementia. The findings are crucial for planning future healthcare and social services to accommodate the needs of an aging population."}}]]
