Further analysis was carried out by DHSS research staff, who also linked the survey information to data from the Department's own records.
The study was originally set up:
(1) to establish the actual incomes, in and out of work, of men (and their families) experiencing unemployment, thereby providing a measure of the actual financial incentives to work and of the level replacement when unemployed;
(2) to establish the association between such financial incentives (or disincentives) and labour market behaviour, covering not only the association between benefit levels, job search activity and number or length of employment spells for males, but also the response of wives' labour market activity to their husband's unemployment history;
(3) to establish the extent of recurrent unemployment and its effects on benefit entitlement.
The sample was drawn by DHSS/DE Computer Centres from men registering as unemployed and claiming benefit in the autumn of 1978. The first interview was held with 2,300 men representing 72 per cent of the original sample in the autumn of 1978. Three sets of interviews were conducted with each sample member in total, and, if married or living as married, with his wife, the first one held about one month after registration, the second 4 months after registration, the third a year after registration.
The study was updated in 1987 with a sample which included women. For details see SN: 2935 <i>Cohort Study of Incomes In and Out of Work</i>.  Variables
The Cohort Study is a large and very complex data set; the first interview alone presents over 800 data items on each of the 2300 sample members, the second and third interviews being of comparable size. It offers a very rich data source, yielding information on the job characteristics and job histories of entrants to unemployment, as well as detailed information on their experience while unemployed. Below is a short description of the main elements of the Cohort Data Set.
(a) Employment histories
Data were collected week by week on employment status for men and their wives, including work (full- and part- time separately coded), unemployment (registered and un-registered separately coded), sickness, full-time education, training and so on, covering either the 12 months prior to entry and 12 months subsequent, or for 12 months prior and 6-8 weeks for the year after. In addition to this continuous data, there is also 'snapshot' information on jobs held at various dates pre- and post-unemployment entry for both men and wives, giving details of these jobs (e.g. earnings, size of firm, industry, occupation, etc.). There is also similar 'snapshot' information on job search. Length and number of unemployment spells and information on actual benefits are also recorded, as well as data items on more distant unemployment (five years before, for example), and some information on experience with YOP, STEP and TOPS courses.
(b) Incomes
Considerable detail was recorded on family income and its components, savings and borrowing and, in the third interview, details on how unemployment has changed consumption patterns.
(c) Other items
1. Information on background characteristics (housing characteristics, education, ethnicity, etc.).
2. A full set of labour demand indicators either by skill level or local area from MSC and DE statistics.
3. Information on health and use of medical and social services in second and third interviews.
4. Information on other things such as second jobs, financial transfers from parents to children, details of special job offers, etc.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Cohort Study of Long Term Unemployed Men, 1978"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Cohort Study of Long Term Unemployed Men, 1978"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/cohort-study-of-long-term-unemployed-men-1978"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Cohort Study of Long Term Unemployed Men, 1978"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Cohort Study of Long Term Unemployed Men, 1978"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
