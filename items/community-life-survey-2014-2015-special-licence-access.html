These measures were incorporated in the Community Life Survey so that trends in these issues could continue to be tracked over time. (The full Citizenship Survey series is held at the UK Data Archive under GNs 33347 and 33474.)

 The 2014-15 survey covers July 2014 to April 2015 and forms &#x27;Official Statistics&#x27;, meaning that it meets the high standards of quality set out by the Code of Practice for Official Statistics. 

End User Licence and Special Licence data
Users should note that there are two versions of each Community Life Survey dataset. One is available under the standard End User Licence (EUL) agreement, and the other is a Special Licence (SL) version. The SL version contains more detailed variables relating to: social class; ethnicity; religion; sexual identity and lower level geographical classifications (see Main Topics section for details). 

The SL data have more restrictive access conditions than those made available under the standard EUL. Prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version. Therefore, users are strongly advised to order the standard version of the data.

The standard EUL version of the Community Life Survey, 2014-2015 dataset is held under SN 7836.
