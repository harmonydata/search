End User Licence and Special Licence data
Users should note that there are two versions of each  Community Life Survey Experimental Online Data experimental online dataset.

Prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version. Therefore, users are strongly advised to order the standard version of the data.
