An international group of marine researchers and practitioners came together in a workshop to co-produce marine identity conceptualisations. This process was supported by a photovoice collection contributed to by participants.

Collaborators recruited to this project shared up to four images representing marine/ocean identity. All ‘photovoice’ contributions were compiled into an album and shared with participants prior to a co-development workshop. Images with appropriate permission to share are included in this data deposit.

An online co-development workshop was held in November 2022 and was attended by 26 participants working in marine research and/or practice.
