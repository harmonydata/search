Typically, each analysis includes demographical and biographical details of the prisoners involved, extracts and summaries from semi-structured interviews held with them, with witnesses and with prison staff concerning the incident. Also included are digests of 'conflict escalators', giving brief details of eight specified factors present in each violent incident, designed to provide a structured account of the event. These incident analyses have been anonymised and the information provided has been further restricted to prevent identification of those involved from descriptions of the event.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Conflicts and Violence in Prison, 1998-2000"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Conflicts and Violence in Prison, 1998-2000"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/conflicts-and-violence-in-prison-1998-2000"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Conflicts and Violence in Prison, 1998-2000"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Conflicts and Violence in Prison, 1998-2000"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
