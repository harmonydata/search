A study was conducted in 2005, but the Archive does not hold the 2005 data.

 This study, the fourth in the series, builds upon previous campaign studies and examines constituency campaigning at the 2010 British General Election. It provides not only a continuation of a valuable time series, but also a programme of innovation that furthers our understanding of the role, impact and nature of campaigns in the modern political arena. 

The study is designed to provide an empirically based account of the style and intensity of constituency campaigning in the election; investigate the role of the parties' central organisations in planning and managing constituency campaigns; analyse the extent to which constituency campaigns involve party members as well as party supporters; and investigate the electoral effects of constituency campaigning in a new electoral context. 

The core of the study is a large questionnaire survey of the election agents of the three major parties and two national parties in all constituencies in Britain save that of the Speaker. The survey includes key questions from previous studies as well as new questions reflecting both changes in campaigning (such as the development of e-campaigning) and innovations in the study such as the measurement of party supporter activity and further measures on long-term campaigning.
