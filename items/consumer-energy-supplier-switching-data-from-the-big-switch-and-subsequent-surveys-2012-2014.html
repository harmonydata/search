The data forms part of a larger collection of individual-level data resulting from a collective energy supplier switching exercise (initiated by the 38 Degrees organisation) known as &#x27;The Big Switch&#x27;, in the UK residential energy market (2012); and two waves of internet based follow-up surveys (2013 and 2014). The data from the collective switching exercise relates to around 111,000 participants who had to decide as part of The Big Switch whether or not to switch energy suppliers in spring 2012. Uniquely, the project team observed the offers made to those who did not switch as well as to those who did switch. In addition to this commercial data obtained from Which? Limited, two waves of follow-up surveys were carried out whereby subsets of participants in the collective switching exercise were emailed a questionnaire to complete. Around 15,000 people completed the questionnaire in the first survey wave in spring 2013. The purpose of this first survey wave was to collect extensive information on household characteristics, engagement with the energy market and context surrounding individuals&#x27; switching decision in &#x27;The Big Switch&#x27;, with individuals who had one or two existing energy suppliers. The aim was to combine data from this survey wave with information from &#x27;The Big Switch&#x27; itself to allow the investigation of the determinants of supplier switching in the UK energy market. Around 11,000 people completed the questionnaire in the second survey wave in spring 2014. The purpose of this second survey wave was to investigate the minimum required saving necessary for an individual to be willing to switch energy supplier along with the factors determining this minimum required saving. In total, 11,065 people provided full responses to the wave 2 survey, of whom 5,478 had also completed the Wave 1 survey.

The online follow-up survey was sent to a sample of participants of The Big Switch exercise in 2012. Complete records of energy bill details and the offer a person received as part of The Big Switch were obtained for 146,659 people. This group was then split into two equally sized sets, each being approached about taking part in different follow-up surveys. 15,360 people provided complete responses to the first follow-up survey in Spring 2013. These figures relate to individuals who had one or two existing energy suppliers. The focus of the 2013 follow-up survey was to elicit information on factors which might affect the probability of an individual switching energy supplier. The second follow-up survey conducted in early 2014 (referred to as Wave 2) investigated the factors that determine the size of the saving required for a household to switch energy supplier. Respondents were asked to consider the hypothetical annual saving required to switch, under the assumption that the new supplier was identical to their existing supplier other than for the monetary saving. The saving stated therefore represents the amount required to compensate the respondent for the ‘hassle’ associated with switching. In total, 11,065 people provided full responses to the Wave 2 survey, of whom 5,478 had also completed the Wave 1 survey."/><meta property="og:title" content="Consumer Energy Supplier Switching: Data from &#x27;The Big Switch&#x27; and Subsequent Surveys, 2012-2014"/><meta property="og:description" content="This dataset represents a second wave follow-up survey carried out in 2014, investigating the minimum required saving necessary for an individual to be willing to switch energy supplier, along with the factors determining this minimum required saving for a household to switch energy supplier.

Energy Supplier Switching: Data from 'The Big Switch' and Subsequent Surveys, 2012-2014\",\"description\":\"This dataset represents a second wave follow-up survey carried out in 2014, investigating the minimum required saving necessary for an individual to be willing to switch energy supplier, along with the factors determining this minimum required saving for a household to switch energy supplier. The data forms part of a larger collection of individual-level data resulting from a collective energy supplier switching exercise (initiated by the 38 Degrees organisation) known as 'The Big Switch', in the UK residential energy market (2012); and two waves of internet based follow-up surveys (2013 and 2014). The data from the collective switching exercise relates to around 111,000 participants who had to decide as part of The Big Switch whether or not to switch energy suppliers in spring 2012. Uniquely, the project team observed the offers made to those who did not switch as well as to those who did switch. In addition to this commercial data obtained from Which? Limited, two waves of follow-up surveys were carried out whereby subsets of participants in the collective switching exercise were emailed a questionnaire to complete. Around 15,000 people completed the questionnaire in the first survey wave in spring 2013. The purpose of this first survey wave was to collect extensive information on household characteristics, engagement with the energy market and context surrounding individuals' switching decision in 'The Big Switch', with individuals who had one or two existing energy suppliers. The aim was to combine data from this survey wave with information from 'The Big Switch' itself to allow the investigation of the determinants of supplier switching in the UK energy market. Around 11,000 people completed the questionnaire in the second survey wave in spring 2014. The purpose of this second survey wave was to investigate the minimum required saving necessary for an individual to be willing to switch energy supplier along with the factors determining this minimum required saving. In total, 11,065 people provided full responses to the wave 2 survey, of whom 5,478 had also completed the Wave 1 survey.\\n\\nThe online follow-up survey was sent to a sample of participants of The Big Switch exercise in 2012. Complete records of energy bill details and the offer a person received as part of The Big Switch were obtained for 146,659 people. This group was then split into two equally sized sets, each being approached about taking part in different follow-up surveys. 15,360 people provided complete responses to the first follow-up survey in Spring 2013. These figures relate to individuals who had one or two existing energy suppliers. The focus of the 2013 follow-up survey was to elicit information on factors which might affect the probability of an individual switching energy supplier. The second follow-up survey conducted in early 2014 (referred to as Wave 2) investigated the factors that determine the size of the saving required for a household to switch energy supplier. Respondents were asked to consider the hypothetical annual saving required to switch, under the assumption that the new supplier was identical to their existing supplier other than for the monetary saving. The saving stated therefore represents the amount required to compensate the respondent for the ‘hassle’ associated with switching.
