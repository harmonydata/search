Groups were segregated on the basis of sex, age and socio-economic grouping to facilitate easier interaction between group members. Therefore in total, 67 individuals participated - 50 females and 17 males (Table 1). Each participant had some responsibility for buying beef and fish in their household.  All participants provided informed written consent and the study was approved by the School of Biological Sciences Ethical Committee at Queen's University Belfast.As food supply chains have become increasingly global and complex, new and challenging risks have emerged. One of the risks gaining attention from industry, governments, regulatory bodies and consumer organisations is food fraud conducted for economic gain. The Food Standards Agency says that Food fraud is committed 'when food is deliberately placed on the\nmarket, for financial gain, with the intention of deceiving the consumer'. Although there are many kinds of food fraud the two main types are: (1) the sale of food which is unfit for consumption and (2) the deliberate misdescription of food. Both types may directly threaten human health. For example, a cancer causing toxin (called melamine) was added to milk and infant formula in China to increase its protein content. Additionally, swapping one fish species with another could expose consumers to different allergens which could make them sick. In many instances, food fraud can reduce consumer trust in the both the food industry and food safety, and negatively impact on sales, as was demonstrated in the UK horsemeat scandal.\nThere is a growing concern that in some ways food fraud may be more risky than traditional threats to the food supply as the adulterants used in these activities are often unconventional. Melamine for example was not considered a potential contaminant in the food supply before 2007 and hence was not included in routine quality checks. In addition, current food protection systems are not designed to look for the never-ending number of potential adulterants that may show up in the food supply. As criminal activity by design is intended to elude detection, new tools and new approaches to supply chain\nmanagement are called for.\n\nThis proposal suggests combining theories and methods from psychology, political economy, sociology, anthropology, criminology and law, with natural science disciplines.In order to develop new approaches to detect possible criminal activity in food supply chains, this project will undertake 34- 40 semi-structured interviews with major buyers, brokers, regulators, customers etc. relating to the three food chains which are most prone to food fraud (wheat; fish and red meat). This will help us to determine how fraud can happen and what measures could be put in place to prevent it from happening in the future. Furthermore, using a desk-based approach we will explore how other countries deal with issues of food safety and analyse legal law cases as they relate to fraud. Based\non an assumption that fraudsters WILL exploit any intelligence gathering system we will examine current and potential models of data collection and intelligence sharing and test their vulnerabilities to future fraudulent attacks. This will help to develop a novel data collection sharing system that is more robust and secure.\n\nBy evaluating a number of risk ranking methodologies used for fraud, food contaminants and emerging food issues, we will develop a risk ranking framework, to classify and highlight food security risks for different food commodities in our chosen supply chains. This will help recognise and prioritise the incentives/pressures to commit fraud, opportunities to commit fraud, and attitudes/rationalisations to justify fraud. A cost-benefit ranking will also be conducted in the risk assessment\nprocedures.\n\nFinally, based on the data gathered for this project and a previous food fraud report we will identify methods of presenting fraud detection/prevention strategies to the public. We will also utilise eight focus groups with consumers to investigate their perceptions, attitudes, behavioural intentions, trust parameters, and expectations in relation to food fraud.

A cost-benefit ranking will also be conducted in the risk assessment
procedures.

Finally, based on the data gathered for this project and a previous food fraud report we will identify methods of presenting fraud detection/prevention strategies to the public. We will also utilise eight focus groups with consumers to investigate their perceptions, attitudes, behavioural intentions, trust parameters, and expectations in relation to food fraud. Based on the findings we will conduct a survey (with 1000 UK consumers aged 18+ from different socio-demographic groups) to experimentally test the efficacy and feasibility of different fraud prevention strategies for its impact on enhancing consumer
trust and increasing sales.17:T121c,Using a purposive sampling method at four locations across the UK, participants were invited by a marketing company to attend one of eight scheduled focus groups sessions (January 2016). Groups were segregated on the basis of sex, age and socio-economic grouping to facilitate easier interaction between group members. Therefore in total, 67 individuals participated - 50 females and 17 males (Table 1). Each participant had some responsibility for buying beef and fish in their household.  All participants provided informed written consent and the study was approved by the School of Biological Sciences Ethical Committee at Queen's University Belfast.As food supply chains have become increasingly global and complex, new and challenging risks have emerged. One of the risks gaining attention from industry, governments, regulatory bodies and consumer organisations is food fraud conducted for economic gain. The Food Standards Agency says that Food fraud is committed 'when food is deliberately placed on the
market, for financial gain, with the intention of deceiving the consumer'. Although there are many kinds of food fraud the two main types are: (1) the sale of food which is unfit for consumption and (2) the deliberate misdescription of food. Both types may directly threaten human health. For example, a cancer causing toxin (called melamine) was added to milk and infant formula in China to increase its protein content. Additionally, swapping one fish species with another could expose consumers to different allergens which could make them sick. In many instances, food fraud can reduce consumer trust in the both the food industry and food safety, and negatively impact on sales, as was demonstrated in the UK horsemeat scandal.
There is a growing concern that in some ways food fraud may be more risky than traditional threats to the food supply as the adulterants used in these activities are often unconventional. Melamine for example was not considered a potential contaminant in the food supply before 2007 and hence was not included in routine quality checks. In addition, current food protection systems are not designed to look for the never-ending number of potential adulterants that may show up in the food supply. As criminal activity by design is intended to elude detection, new tools and new approaches to supply chain
management are called for.

This proposal suggests combining theories and methods from psychology, political economy, sociology, anthropology, criminology and law, with natural science disciplines.In order to develop new approaches to detect possible criminal activity in food supply chains, this project will undertake 34- 40 semi-structured interviews with major buyers, brokers, regulators, customers etc. relating to the three food chains which are most prone to food fraud (wheat; fish and red meat). This will help us to determine how fraud can happen and what measures could be put in place to prevent it from happening in the future. Furthermore, using a desk-based approach we will explore how other countries deal with issues of food safety and analyse legal law cases as they relate to fraud. Based
on an assumption that fraudsters WILL exploit any intelligence gathering system we will examine current and potential models of data collection and intelligence sharing and test their vulnerabilities to future fraudulent attacks. This will help to develop a novel data collection sharing system that is more robust and secure.

By evaluating a number of risk ranking methodologies used for fraud, food contaminants and emerging food issues, we will develop a risk ranking framework, to classify and highlight food security risks for different food commodities in our chosen supply chains. This will help recognise and prioritise the incentives/pressures to commit fraud, opportunities to commit fraud, and attitudes/rationalisations to justify fraud. A cost-benefit ranking will also be conducted in the risk assessment
procedures.
