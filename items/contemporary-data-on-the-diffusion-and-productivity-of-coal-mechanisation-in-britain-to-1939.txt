1c:T162e,A common feature of Britain's staple industries during the sixty years to 1939 was a rejection of the new production technologies adopted by their main overseas competitors. This project investigated the extent to which 'path dependence' accounts for the failure of these industries  to adopt the new production technologies, via a case study of the  British coal industry. One of Britain's most important nineteenth  century staple industries, coal mining experienced a particularly  severe interwar decline. Meanwhile, it remained less mechanised than most of its major competitors, including some countries where geological conditions were regarded as less favourable.

The project assessed the extent to which 'technical interrelatedness'  impeded modernisation through complementarities between different items of plant, which reduced the profitability of modernising any one stage of the production process. These problems were magnified by the extremely high costs of modernising certain stages of production. 

Such problems were compounded by 'institutional interrelatedness' arising from Britain's fragmented mineral royalty system. The project analysed  whether any significant 'lock-in' to prevailing technologies existed, the mechanisms through which any lock-in occurred, and the efficiency losses arising therefrom. The data comprise:

Comparative costs of getting coal by machine and hand in 1885
Number of coal cutting machines at work and estimated output during 1899 and 1900
Diffusion of coal-cutters in the United States and the United Kingdom (1899-1901)
Performance of Pickquick bar-type coal cutting machines in representative longwall seams over a 12 month period, c. 1905
Approximate working costs (d per ton) for hand-holing, machine-holing, and machine-holing in combination with mechanical conveyance
Comparison of hand and mechanised mining in 1915
Comparison of the gross weight (pounds) of mine cars hauling 4 tons of coal in the United States and England
Empirical results of working by four methods the same seam, 2.75-3 feet thick, c. 1923
Application of machinery in Scottish mines, 1905-24
Cost per ton for standing and running charges for coal-cutters, c. 1926
Distribution of working costs underground in a machine-mined seam (late 1920s)

Comparative costs of various types of haulage over a period of four years 
Output per manshift and percentage of coal won by mechanical means,  principal coal-exporting countries
Tonnage mechanically conveyed in Britain (thousand tons) 1930-1938
