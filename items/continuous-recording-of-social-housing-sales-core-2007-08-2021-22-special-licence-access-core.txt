2d:Tebb,The COntinuous REcording of Lettings and Sales (CORE) is a national information source that provides annual official statistics on new lettings and sales of social housing stock. All datasets are based on administrative data collected via the government's CORE system.

The CORE lettings data include information on the characteristics of both private registered providers and local authority new social housing tenants and the homes they rent. For each year, data is structured into four datasets based on type of letting (social rent general needs and supported needs, and affordable rent general needs and supported needs). It is a regulatory requirement for providers registered with the Homes and Communities Agency to supply the data. For those who are not registered, submissions are voluntary. Local authorities have participated in CORE since 2004-5 on a voluntary basis. Weighting is applied to adjust for non-response by local authorities for social rent datasets, and imputation is also carried out to address item-level non-response of key data on tenant characteristics for both local authorities and privately registered providers. The three datasets for affordable rent are not weighted or imputed. 
The CORE sales data include information on sales of local authority dwellings and some summary details on sales of registered provider stock (previously known as Registered Social Landlords or housing associations). Collecting these data allows for a better understanding of the socio-economic and demographic make-up of affordable housing customers and local housing markets and products. The sales dataset is imputed, with more information on the imputations within the data dictionary.

The CORE data are used by central government to inform national housing policy and by local government to inform their Strategic Housing Market Assessments. The data are also used by academics, researchers, charities and the wider public to understand social housing issues.
Further information may be found on the GOV.UK Social housing lettings and Social housing sales webpages.
Users should note that the Lettings and Sales data are now held in separate datasets at each access level (see below). Previously, they were held in combined studies, SNs 7603, 7604 and 7686, which have now been withdrawn.
End User Licence, Special Licence and Secure Access datasets
The CORE datasets are available at three access levels, depending on the level of detail in the data.

For the standard End User Licence (EUL) version (SNs 9237 and 9238), the geographic level of the data is set at Government Office Region (GOR). Letting and voiding dates are provided at month and year only; age variables are top-coded at 90 years; income, benefits, earnings, charge and shortfall variables are banded to disguise unique values; landlords are grouped into coded categories.
For the Special Licence access (SL) version (SNs 9239 and 9240), geographic level is set at Local Authority. The SL data have more restrictive access conditions than those made available under the standard EUL. Prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version.
For Secure Access (SNs 9241 and 9242), the full CORE datasets are available, with some key variables recoded. Prospective users of the Secure Access version will need to fulfil additional requirements, including completion of face-to-face training and agreement to further stringent access conditions. SN 9240: Continuous Recording of Social Housing Sales (CORE):This study contains the SL-level CORE Sales data only.
