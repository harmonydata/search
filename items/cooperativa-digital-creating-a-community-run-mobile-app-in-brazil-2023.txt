The House of Lords' Beyond Digital report highlights the first two: 1) equity, because digital relationships take place in conditions of power asymmetry and structural inequity and 2) resilience, because individual and collective wellbeing, wellness and coping strategies in the face of pandemics, political conflicts, natural disasters, digital misinformation, online hate and everyday life matter in digital relationships and for our realisation of the digital good. The third societal challenge is sustainability, because planetary challenges like climate change demand that we consider whether our digital relationships are sustainable (as highlighted in UK, EU and UN policy goals). Digital relationships unfold within, are shaped by and shape societies and structures, so addressing these three pressing societal challenges is crucial to envisioning good digital relationships. 

 

DGN will expand research capacity and deliver a step-change in digital society scholarship and its impact on policy, industries and communities. It will build a network of researchers from social science disciplines and beyond, including eg cultural studies, anthropology and design from the arts and humanities, and computing and engineering from STEM. DGN activities are designed to engage researchers from diverse career stages, with expertise in diverse domains, and stakeholders from policy, practice, industries, cultural sectors and communities, to ensure research is co-produced with, responds to, and feeds into these sectors. These disciplines, career stages, domains and sectors are all represented in the DGN core team and College of Experts, who will link DGN to people, organisations and networks within and beyond these groups.17:T18b0,The data for this project consists of qualitative data collected through four co-design workshops with a community of NGOs in São Luís, Brazil. The file contains a dataset with files for each workshop (e.g., Workshop 1, Workshop 2) in English and Brazilian Portuguese. Each file contains the work of a participant group (e.g., Group 1, Group 2, Group 3) and a discussion about the workshop results. Following each workshop, the research team held an online debrief meeting to discuss the outcomes and reflections on the process.

The data includes:
- Artefacts produced by participants: This includes sketches, diagrams, notes, and other materials created by participants during the workshops, offering insights into their design thinking and decision-making processes.
- Video recordings (MP4): 
- Audio recordings of the workshop discussions and artefacts compiled them into a video summarising the workshop, providing a rich source of qualitative data on participant perspectives and interactions. The original audio recordings were in Brazilian Portuguese.
- Detailed videos recorded by the research team after the workshops, capturing discussions, ideas, and decisions made by participants.
- Discussion transcripts: Transcripts of the workshop discussions recorded using a Dictaphone (or similar audio recorder) and presented in a video summary to gather additional insights into participants' experiences and perspectives on the project.
- Online debrief meetings (MP4):  These meetings were recorded to document the experiment and reflections on the process.
- Online debrief meeting transcripts (PDF): Online debrief meetings were held in English and transcripts were self-generated by Zoom. 

Transcription process:
- Manual transcription: A researcher on the project primarily transcribed the audio recordings to capture the nuances of the discussions.
- Microsoft Stream: In some cases. Microsoft Stream was used to support the transcription process.
- Zoom: Online debrief meetings were held in English and transcripts were self-generated by Zoom.

Translation process:
- Manual translation: A researcher on the project primarily translated the transcriptions to English.
- Human review: The DeepL translations were subsequently reviewed by a human translator to ensure accuracy.

This data was collected to document the co-design process, understand the challenges and opportunities of translating commons scholarship into practice, and assess the effectiveness of the co-design workshops in empowering the community to shape the future of the Reapp platform. The data is stored securely and will be anonymised to protect the privacy of participants. This will involve removing names and replacing any other identifying details from the transcripts, notes, and artefacts.Digital technologies are not always good for societies. Across research, policy, industry and civil society, how to define, measure and build good digital societies needs urgent attention. The digital good is ill-defined and contested, and the resulting lack of consensus can be harmful. For example, algorithmic decision-making can introduce bias under the guise of fairness; policies designed to make social media safer are experienced by users as doing the opposite. To limit future harms and ensure that digital technologies have positive outcomes, The Digital Good Network (DGN) will deliver an interdisciplinary, social science-led research programme centred on the urgent, neglected question of what the digital good should look like and how it can be achieved. 

 

DGN bridges disciplines and institutions and is global in outlook. It is led by transdisciplinary researchers at different career stages and by partners from policy, industry, community and cultural sectors. DGN will: 

support research projects and methodological innovation across disciplines and various dimensions of the digital good; 

offer internships, fellowships and training; 

host technology design sprints and workshops; 

co-produce research with policy, industry and communities; and 

produce a Digital Good Index, based on original research, horizon scanning and open data. 

Ultimately, DGN will lead to a step-change in enabling societies to realise the digital good. 

 

DGN?will generate new insights into urgent normative questions relating to people's relationships with and through digital technologies (or 'digital relationships'), by focusing on three societal challenges that are crucial to envisioning good?relationships with and through digital technologies:?equity, resilience and sustainability.
