The programme included the creation domestic and commercial scale DER ecosystems that formed part of the LEM trials. The domestic DER ecosystem was made up of 100 private homes, distributed across Cornwall. Each home received a Sonnen battery and solar PV system (where the home did not have an existing PV system). This data deposit and associated reports constitutes the research findings from the domestic DER workstreame:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Cornwall LEM Residential Electricity Dataset with Solar Production and Battery Storage, 2018-2020"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Cornwall LEM Residential Electricity Dataset with Solar Production and Battery Storage, 2018-2020"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/cornwall-lem-residential-electricity-dataset-with-solar-production-and-battery-storage-2018-2020"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Cornwall LEM Residential Electricity Dataset with Solar Production and Battery Storage, 2018-2020"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Cornwall LEM Residential Electricity Dataset with Solar Production and Battery Storage, 2018-2020"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
