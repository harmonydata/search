The Measurement Datasets include the following: 1) Timeseries Database Table: t_msb1m (resolution 1-min): Sonnen data recorded from the 'MySonnenBatterie' (MSB) portal, including a range of Energy records and State of Charge data. 2) Timeseries Database Table: t_ims1m (resolution 1-min): Independent Monitoring System (IMS), consisting of Energy, Power, Grid Voltage, Grid Frequency & Grid Power. 3) Timeseries Database Table: t_ims1s (resolution 1-sec): Independent Monitoring System (IMS), consisting of Power (PV, Grid, BESS) and Grid Frequency.
The Forecast Datasets include the following: 1) Timeseries Database Table: t_prodconsforecasts (resolution 1-hr): Production & Consumption Forecasts from Sonnen, via Sonnen VPP. 2) Timeseries Database Table: t_weatherforecasts (resolution 1-hr): Weather Forecasts from external provider, via the MSB portal, including precipitation, solar irradiance and sunshine hours, available at Post Code District level. 
The Dimension Datasets include the following: 1) Database Table: t_sites: Site List, linking the persistent site ID, to Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) type, BESS power/energy capacities, photovoltaic (PV) capacity and major load type. 2) Additional MetaData: including the following: a) Original Web Questionnaire; completed by respondents from the original recruitment exercise - results available for 66 sites; b) Desktop & Site Surveys, Design & System Costs; completed by SunGift (Installation Contractor) on behalf of Sonnen (BESS Vendor) - results available for 71 sites; c) Summary of EPC data; data retrieved from the EPC register[1] completed by TLC - results available for 75 sites.

[1]  EPC Register (England & Wales), https://www.epcregister.com/, accessed October 2020The Cornwall Local Energy Market (LEM) is a £17m programme that sought to design, build and trial an auction-based flexibility market for distribution network-connected decentralised energy resources (DER). The programme included the creation domestic and commercial scale DER ecosystems that formed part of the LEM trials. The domestic DER ecosystem was made up of 100 private homes, distributed across Cornwall. Each home received a Sonnen battery and solar PV system (where the home did not have an existing PV system). This data deposit and associated reports constitutes the research findings from the domestic DER workstream28:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2c"}]
