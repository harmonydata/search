1. Adherence to the study allocation, reach and fidelity (i.e. whether SA is delivered as intended, works as hypothesized, is scalable and sustainable).
2. The feasibility and acceptability of proposed outcome measures for a definitive trial, including resource use and health-related quality of life data, as methods to measure effectiveness of the intervention and to conduct an embedded health economic evaluation within a definitive RCT.
3. The feasibility and acceptability of linkage to routinely collected data within a definitive RCT by assessing whether (a) participants are willing to consent for their data to be linked and (b) personal identifiers can be linked to NHS Digital routine datasets.

Quantitative data was collected at baseline and follow-up at 3 and 6 months. 50 participants were invited to complete outcome measures. These participants completed the questionnaire over the telephone with trained members of staff based at the University. Data was entered into Qualtrics application system and used to collect consent and questionnaire response data. The trial explored past and current experiences of homeless individuals in relation to a range of life domains, including; housing, health, adverse life experiences such as imprisonment, and substance misuse. 
Participants were also invited to take part in qualitative interviews to discuss the acceptability of the study and its processes, including randomisation, and their willingness to participate in a definitive trial. They were also asked about their experience of services and provision. Data from 14 participants and 1 researcher in the Moving On Study was gathered.As part of the government's response to COVID-19, 15,000 rough sleepers have now been offered self-contained temporary accommodation in England, mainly in hotels. This approach, which has involved the decanting of hostels, shelters and similar shared provision for rough sleepers, is a short-term response.

When the lockdown ends, decisions will need to be taken about how to house former rough sleepers in line with the UK government's commitment to prevent people from going back to the streets - including, potentially, through the re-opening of shelter-type accommodation. Existing temporary accommodation with shared facilities might make it impossible for people to comply with government social distancing advice. So these decisions will impact on the risk of a second wave of infection from COVID-19 and possibly any mutations.

This proposal outlines a unique time limited opportunity to conduct the first ever randomised controlled trial in the UK, to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of permanent housing on the risk of COVID-19 infection and housing stability for people experiencing homelessness.

That many homeless people are currently waiting to be housed means they can be randomly allocated to different housing solutions at scale quickly. The insights drawn from the short-term impacts of permanent housing can be used to inform other local authorities' responses to the challenges of COVID-19 and the cost-effectiveness of accommodation alternatives more broadly.1f:["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:description","content":"$2e"}]

2f:Tfcb,This trial outlines a unique time limited opportunity to conduct the first ever randomised controlled trial in the UK, to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of randomising participants to Settled Accommodation (SA) or Temporary Accommodation (TA) with the aim of preventing COVID-19 infection and reducing housing instability.

The study’s primary objectives were to assess the following:
1. The feasibility of recruiting local authorities and eligible participants to the study.
2. Recruitment rates of participants and retention through 3 months and 6 months post randomisation follow-up data collection.
3. The acceptability of the study and its processes, including randomisation, to single homeless households and local authorities and their willingness to participate in a definitive trial.  

In addition, the study also aims to assess the following Secondary objectives:
1. Adherence to the study allocation, reach and fidelity (i.e. whether SA is delivered as intended, works as hypothesized, is scalable and sustainable).
2. The feasibility and acceptability of proposed outcome measures for a definitive trial, including resource use and health-related quality of life data, as methods to measure effectiveness of the intervention and to conduct an embedded health economic evaluation within a definitive RCT.
