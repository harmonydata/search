Existing temporary accommodation with shared facilities might make it impossible for people to comply with government social distancing advice. So these decisions will impact on the risk of a second wave of infection from COVID-19 and possibly any mutations.

This proposal outlines a unique time limited opportunity to conduct the first ever randomised controlled trial in the UK, to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of permanent housing on the risk of COVID-19 infection and housing stability for people experiencing homelessness.

That many homeless people are currently waiting to be housed means they can be randomly allocated to different housing solutions at scale quickly. The insights drawn from the short-term impacts of permanent housing can be used to inform other local authorities' responses to the challenges of COVID-19 and the cost-effectiveness of accommodation alternatives more broadly.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"COVID-19 and Rough Sleepers: A Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial of Models of Housing and Support To Reduce Risks of COVID-19 Infection and Homelessness: Moving On Study, 2020-2022"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"COVID-19 and Rough Sleepers: A Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial of Models of Housing and Support To Reduce Risks of COVID-19 Infection and Homelessness: Moving On Study, 2020-2022"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/covid-19-and-rough-sleepers-a-pilot-randomised-controlled-trial-of-models-of-housing-and-support-to-reduce-risks-of-covid-19-infection"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"COVID-19 and Rough Sleepers: A Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial of Models of Housing and Support To Reduce Risks of COVID-19 Infection and Homelessness: Moving On Study, 2020-2022"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"COVID-19 and Rough Sleepers: A Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial of Models of Housing and Support To Reduce Risks of COVID-19 Infection and Homelessness: Moving On Study, 2020-2022"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
