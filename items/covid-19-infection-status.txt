18:T544,NaturalInfection_WideCDC_Interpretation_MaxToDate. Serology-based SARS-CoV-2 natural infection status based on all available lab antibody and antigen tests. Tests interpreted based on CDC guidance taking into account individual's vaccination status at time of testing. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/antibody-tests-guidelines.html. 
Evidence of natural infection: Positive anti-S antibody before vaccination or positive anti-N at any time or positive antigen test at any time
No evidence of natural infection: All anti-N and antigen test results negative and anti-S before vaccination negative. Anti-S after vaccination can be negative or positive - positive results assumed to be due to immune response caused by vaccination. 
Possible evidence: When anti-S positive but vaccination status at time of testing is unknown (vaccination status relies on self-reported dates of vaccinations).  
No antibody results to interpret: Individual has no non-void lab-tests available to generate status

The serology-based infection status was generated using both Roche ELISA tests and earlier anti-N and anti-S ELISA antibody results performed in King's College London labs between April 2020 and May 2021. 

Raw data were from Roche Elecsys assays (https://diagnostics.roche.com/gb/en/products/params/elecsys-anti-sars-cov-2.html). c:["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":[["$","$L16",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Dataset\",\"name\":\"Covid-19 infection status\",\"description\":\"Summary variable of the serology-based SARS-CoV-2 natural infection status, based on all available lab antibody and antigen tests. \",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/covid-19-infection-status\",\"identifier\":[],\"keywords\":[\"Covid-19 data collection\",\"Biomarkers\",\"Cognitive measures\",\"Diet and nutrition\",\"Sexuality and gender identity\",\"Socioeconomic status and deprivation\",\"Language and literacy\",\"Loneliness and social isolation\",\"Migration and immigration\",\"Neighbourhood\",\"Physical health assessment\",\"Political and social attitudes\",\"Digital technology and social media\",\"Victimisation and life events\",\"Reproductive health\",\"Work and employment\",\"Sleep problems\"],\"temporalCoverage\":\"20-04/22-01\"}"}}],["$","$L17",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Covid-19 infection status","description":"Summary variable of the serology-based SARS-CoV-2 natural infection status, based on all available lab antibody and antigen tests.
