No evidence of natural infection: All anti-N and antigen test results negative and anti-S before vaccination negative. Anti-S after vaccination can be negative or positive - positive results assumed to be due to immune response caused by vaccination.

The serology-based infection status was generated using both Roche ELISA tests and earlier anti-N and anti-S ELISA antibody results performed in King's College London labs between April 2020 and May 2021.
