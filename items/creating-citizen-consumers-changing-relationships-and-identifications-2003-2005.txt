 This mixed methods data collection contains three elements; semi-structured individual interview transcripts, focus group interview transcripts and data from questionnaires. 

The individual interviews cover senior staff, front-line staff and users in three public services (health, policing and social care) in two urban settings in England (the pseudonyms 'Newtown' and 'Oldtown' were used for the two locations). The interviews explore the rise and significance of consumerist approaches to the provision of services.

The focus group interviews were conducted with a mixture of service users and professionals, from each of the three services in both locations. They cover experiences of service use and provision.

The questionnaire data are at aggregate level, compiled from questionnaires distributed to front-line staff and users in the three services in both locations. The questionnaires examine attitudes to four dimensions of consumerism: challenge; choice; inequality and responsibility. Qualitative data from the questionnaires, taken from an open entry section accompanying the question on 'identifications', are also included in a separate file. All questionnaire data files are in Rich Text Format (RTF).e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Creating Citizen-Consumers: Changing Relationships and Identifications, 2003-2005"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Creating Citizen-Consumers: Changing Relationships and Identifications, 2003-2005"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/creating-citizen-consumers-changing-relationships-and-identifications-2003-2005"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Creating Citizen-Consumers: Changing Relationships and Identifications, 2003-2005"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Creating Citizen-Consumers: Changing Relationships and Identifications, 2003-2005"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
