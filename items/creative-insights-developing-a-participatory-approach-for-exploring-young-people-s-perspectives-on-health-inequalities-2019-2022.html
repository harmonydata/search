In 2018, the project was conceived as a partnership between researchers at University of Glasgow’s MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit and CoSS, and community organisations Impact Arts in Glasgow and Leeds Playhouse that would involve dynamic face-to-face workshops with artists, young people and researchers working together to develop research and creative outputs with a message for policymakers. In practice, the onset of the pandemic switched the focus to delivering all aspects of the project online, including focus group discussions, workshop activities, and individual and collaborative art-making. As such, the data included in this collection comprises transcripts of Zoom recordings and the final artworks presented by each of the young participants. Focus group discussions focused on various themes relating to health inequalities and their potential solutions, with descriptions of prompts and activities detailed in the topic guides.The enduring existence of health inequalities, unfair differences in the health and wellbeing of different groups in society, is a key concern for many citizens, researchers and policymakers. Research that has focused on public views of the causes of these differences suggests that, in general, people have well-developed understandings of the factors that contribute to health inequalities. People from communities across the UK have identified the range of upstream factors which influence their health and the health of those around them, including housing conditions, unemployment and lack of funding for communities and services. Despite both policymakers and public groups understanding these causes, limited progress has been made towards reducing health inequalities in Scotland or UK-wide. Citizens&#x27; views on this lack of progress, and their perceptions of potential policy measures which could reduce health inequalities, have not been explored in detail. Young people&#x27;s perspectives on these issues are also not currently well understood. 

Media representations of health inequalities can negatively impact those communities and individuals most impacted by inequalities by furthering feelings of stigma or shame, related to the areas they live in being labelled deprived or disadvantaged. Calls for new qualitative research suggests that researchers should engage sensitively with the topic and avoid stigmatising language, but also aim to include diverse population groups to explore the consequences of inequality across society. Various models of research have been proposed to overcome some of these barriers, including participatory research which invites participants to actively shape projects and contribute to outputs alongside researchers. 

In order to develop our understanding of young people&#x27;s views on health inequalities, this project involves working together with young people in Glasgow and Leeds, cities where reducing health inequalities is a priority. Creative organisations (Impact Arts in Glasgow and Opera North in Leeds), who have contributed to the development of this project, will facilitate the engagement of groups of young people in several workshop sessions. These sessions will be led by researchers and creative partners, who are experienced in delivering creative engagement events with groups of the public, to explore the causes and consequences of health inequalities. Participants will also be supported to discuss their perspectives on potential policy solutions, pursuing those issues which they prioritise as most important or most relevant to their lives, communities or peers. Over the course of the sessions participants will also engage in creative processes to produce artistic outputs that reflect their perspectives on the enduring public health problem of health inequalities. These creative outputs will provide the focus for a series of engagement events and workshops with representatives from local government, health boards, third sector organisations and local communities. By generating new insights and creative representations of these, young people will be facilitated to actively contribute to ongoing policy discussions about the reduction of social inequalities in health across both local and national contexts."/><meta property="og:title" content="Creative Insights: Developing a Participatory Approach for Exploring Young People&#x27;s Perspectives on Health Inequalities, 2019-2022"/><meta property="og:description" content="Creative Insights is a research project focused on exploring young people’s perspectives on health inequalities, particularly their ideas for potential solutions.

Insights: Developing a Participatory Approach for Exploring Young People's Perspectives on Health Inequalities, 2019-2022\",\"description\":\"Creative Insights is a research project focused on exploring young people’s perspectives on health inequalities, particularly their ideas for potential solutions. In 2018, the project was conceived as a partnership between researchers at University of Glasgow’s MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit and CoSS, and community organisations Impact Arts in Glasgow and Leeds Playhouse that would involve dynamic face-to-face workshops with artists, young people and researchers working together to develop research and creative outputs with a message for policymakers. In practice, the onset of the pandemic switched the focus to delivering all aspects of the project online, including focus group discussions, workshop activities, and individual and collaborative art-making. As such, the data included in this collection comprises transcripts of Zoom recordings and the final artworks presented by each of the young participants. Focus group discussions focused on various themes relating to health inequalities and their potential solutions, with descriptions of prompts and activities detailed in the topic guides.The enduring existence of health inequalities, unfair differences in the health and wellbeing of different groups in society, is a key concern for many citizens, researchers and policymakers. Research that has focused on public views of the causes of these differences suggests that, in general, people have well-developed understandings of the factors that contribute to health inequalities. People from communities across the UK have identified the range of upstream factors which influence their health and the health of those around them, including housing conditions, unemployment and lack of funding for communities and services. Despite both policymakers and public groups understanding these causes, limited progress has been made towards reducing health inequalities in Scotland or UK-wide. Citizens' views on this lack of progress, and their perceptions of potential policy measures which could reduce health inequalities, have not been explored in detail. Young people's perspectives on these issues are also not currently well understood. \\n\\nMedia representations of health inequalities can negatively impact those communities and individuals most impacted by inequalities by furthering feelings of stigma or shame, related to the areas they live in being labelled deprived or disadvantaged. Calls for new qualitative research suggests that researchers should engage sensitively with the topic and avoid stigmatising language, but also aim to include diverse population groups to explore the consequences of inequality across society. Various models of research have been proposed to overcome some of these barriers, including participatory research which invites participants to actively shape projects and contribute to outputs alongside researchers. \\n\\nIn order to develop our understanding of young people's views on health inequalities, this project involves working together with young people in Glasgow and Leeds, cities where reducing health inequalities is a priority. Creative organisations (Impact Arts in Glasgow and Opera North in Leeds), who have contributed to the development of this project, will facilitate the engagement of groups of young people in several workshop sessions. These sessions will be led by researchers and creative partners, who are experienced in delivering creative engagement events with groups of the public, to explore the causes and consequences of health inequalities. Participants will also be supported to discuss their perspectives on potential policy solutions, pursuing those issues which they prioritise as most important or most relevant to their lives, communities or peers. Over the course of the sessions participants will also engage in creative processes to produce artistic outputs that reflect their perspectives on the enduring public health problem of health inequalities. These creative outputs will provide the focus for a series of engagement events and workshops with representatives from local government, health boards, third sector organisations and local communities. By generating new insights and creative representations of these, young people will be facilitated to actively contribute to ongoing policy discussions about the reduction of social inequalities in health across both local and national contexts.\",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/creative-insights-developing-a-participatory-approach-for-exploring-young-people-s-perspectives-on-health-inequalities-2019-2022\",\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-855952\"],\"keywords\":[\"SOCIAL INEQUALITY\",\"HEALTH POLICY\",\"YOUTH\",\"PERFORMING ARTS\",\"VISUAL ARTS\",\"HEALTH\",\"HEALTH PRIORITIES\"],\"temporalCoverage\":\"2019-12-01/2022-08-30\"}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"17:T1141,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Creative Insights is a research project focused on exploring young people’s perspectives on health inequalities, particularly their ideas for potential solutions.
