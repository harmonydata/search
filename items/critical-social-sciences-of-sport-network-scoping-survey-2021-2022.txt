The survey was distributed via the email lists and social media accounts of a number of learned societies/professional bodies who were supporting partners of the project. These were the Sport Study Group of the British Sociological Association, the Sport Specialist Group of the Political Studies Association, the British Society for Sport Historians, the British Philosophy of Sport Association, the Leisure Studies Association, and the Football Collective. Additional recruitment and reminders were sent via the social media accounts of the project and the accounts of the individual investigators. \nThe aim of the survey was to provide an overview of those working in the sector. Questions sought details of the demographic characteristics of respondents (job roles, career stage, educational background), current teaching (degrees taught on, level of teaching, hours dedicated to teaching), research (conference papers, journal articles, research supervision, theories and methods), organisational affiliations, conference activities and motivations for both.\nThe survey was open from in October 2021 until January 2022. A total of 32 responses were received. A parallel survey was conducted in Taiwan to enable a comparison of the field in two cultural contexts. Due to the low level of response in both locations the findings were not developed for publication as originally intended.The project draws together researchers from the UK and Taiwan who study sport from critical social scientific perspectives such as sociology, politics, human geography, and communication studies. The UK and Taiwan are world leaders in these fields, and the UK and Taiwan applicants have a proven track record of collaboration. While previous collaborations have been built on the common issues sport faces in in the two countries - most notably nationalism and gender - the two countries also face similar emerging issues around immigration and sport and foreign investment in domestic sporting cultures. This project will expand existing relations through sharing ideas, evidence, methods and experience. This will stimulate new research projects of international significance. However, additional benefits will include improving academic-public engagement, creating more cohesive research communities in the two countries, and boosting the international profile of both UK and Taiwan scholars in the field of sport and social science. \nRelations between UK and Taiwan researchers will be strengthened in multiple ways. A website will serve as a vehicle for the sharing and dissemination of information about the broader project. Podcasts will include introductory information about the sport cultures in the two countries and focus on the most pressing contemporary issues. Scoping surveys will map the field and identify areas with the greatest potential for future development. Research partnerships will be developed through targeted financial support and a mentoring programme especially designed to assist Early Career Researchers (ECRs). Exchange visits to the UK and Taiwan will include a series of events which showcase research strengths, explore what can be mutually learnt about academic-media-public engagements, strengthen both domestic and international organisational collaborations, and support doctoral students and ECRs. Social media will be used throughout the project to engage research communities, publicise project activities and thus sustain the network. \nProject outputs will be designed to appeal to both academic and public audiences. In both countries we will create databases of expertise within the social sciences of sport. The presentations and posters produced through the network collaborations, including those presented at the domestic meetings and the ISSA Congress, will be hosted on the project website. A journal article will report the findings of scoping surveys and two journal special issues and an edited book have been proposed which will prioritise UK-Taiwan comparative studies of sport initiated by this programme.

These were the Sport Study Group of the British Sociological Association, the Sport Specialist Group of the Political Studies Association, the British Society for Sport Historians, the British Philosophy of Sport Association, the Leisure Studies Association, and the Football Collective. Additional recruitment and reminders were sent via the social media accounts of the project and the accounts of the individual investigators. 
The aim of the survey was to provide an overview of those working in the sector. Questions sought details of the demographic characteristics of respondents (job roles, career stage, educational background), current teaching (degrees taught on, level of teaching, hours dedicated to teaching), research (conference papers, journal articles, research supervision, theories and methods), organisational affiliations, conference activities and motivations for both.
The survey was open from in October 2021 until January 2022. A total of 32 responses were received. A parallel survey was conducted in Taiwan to enable a comparison of the field in two cultural contexts. Due to the low level of response in both locations the findings were not developed for publication as originally intended.The project draws together researchers from the UK and Taiwan who study sport from critical social scientific perspectives such as sociology, politics, human geography, and communication studies. The UK and Taiwan are world leaders in these fields, and the UK and Taiwan applicants have a proven track record of collaboration. While previous collaborations have been built on the common issues sport faces in in the two countries - most notably nationalism and gender - the two countries also face similar emerging issues around immigration and sport and foreign investment in domestic sporting cultures. This project will expand existing relations through sharing ideas, evidence, methods and experience. This will stimulate new research projects of international significance. However, additional benefits will include improving academic-public engagement, creating more cohesive research communities in the two countries, and boosting the international profile of both UK and Taiwan scholars in the field of sport and social science. 
Relations between UK and Taiwan researchers will be strengthened in multiple ways. A website will serve as a vehicle for the sharing and dissemination of information about the broader project. Podcasts will include introductory information about the sport cultures in the two countries and focus on the most pressing contemporary issues. Scoping surveys will map the field and identify areas with the greatest potential for future development. Research partnerships will be developed through targeted financial support and a mentoring programme especially designed to assist Early Career Researchers (ECRs). Exchange visits to the UK and Taiwan will include a series of events which showcase research strengths, explore what can be mutually learnt about academic-media-public engagements, strengthen both domestic and international organisational collaborations, and support doctoral students and ECRs. Social media will be used throughout the project to engage research communities, publicise project activities and thus sustain the network. 
Project outputs will be designed to appeal to both academic and public audiences. In both countries we will create databases of expertise within the social sciences of sport. The presentations and posters produced through the network collaborations, including those presented at the domestic meetings and the ISSA Congress, will be hosted on the project website. A journal article will report the findings of scoping surveys and two journal special issues and an edited book have been proposed which will prioritise UK-Taiwan comparative studies of sport initiated by this programme. Other journal special issues will be proposed around key topics as the original and innovative research emerges. Podcasts will bring together academic and public audiences by focusing on a broad range of content designed to appeal to researchers and students, as well as those in the sports media and sports industry. The project's social media presence will help sustain the network.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Critical Social Sciences of Sport Network Scoping Survey, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Critical Social Sciences of Sport Network Scoping Survey, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/critical-social-sciences-of-sport-network-scoping-survey-2021-2022"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Critical Social Sciences of Sport Network Scoping Survey, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Critical Social Sciences of Sport Network Scoping Survey, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
