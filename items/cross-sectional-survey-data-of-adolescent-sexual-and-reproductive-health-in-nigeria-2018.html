survey data of adolescent sexual and reproductive health in Nigeria 2018\",\"description\":\"A cross-sectional survey of adolescents and heads of households was done in six urban and rural local government areas in Ebonyi state, Nigeria in August 2018. Modified cluster sampling technique was used to select households from which eligible adolescent boys and girls were recruited. The two datasets describes expansively, for the first time, adolescents’ sexual and reproductive behaviours in Nigeria. The datasets include variables on adolescents’ demographic and socioeconomic characteristics; family relationships; sexual behaviour; awareness and use of contraceptives; access to sexual and reproductive health information and services; gender norms and ideology about adolescent sexuality; and potential strategies for reducing unwanted teenage pregnancies and unsafe abortions. The datasets provide a template that could be replicated for national or regional surveys on adolescent sexual and reproductive behaviours.This dataset would be useful to public health researchers and social scientists investigating drivers of adolescent sexual and reproductive behaviour, as well as programme managers seeking potential strategies for improving adolescent health outcomes. The research leading to the datasets in this manuscript received funding from IDRC MENA+WA implementation research project on maternal and child health (IDRC grant number: 108677). The main aim of the project is to adapt, design, implement and evaluate an inclusive community-embedded intervention program to address unmet sexual and reproductive health needs of adolescents in rural and urban areas in Ebonyi state, Nigeria. The project from which the datasets were generated is being implemented in six local government areas in Ebonyi state, Nigeria. At the first phase of the project, situational analysis was conducted using a mixed-method approach (quantitative and qualitative study method). A cross-sectional household survey was carried out among a sample of 1057 adolescents selected from 556 households in urban and rural areas. Twelve adolescent questionnaires were excluded/discarded because they were not properly matched to households, leaving 1045 for analysis. The WHO illustrative questionnaire for interview-surveys with young people was adapted and used to collect data from unmarried adolescents aged 13-18 years. Background characteristics and expenditure patterns of households were elicited using a questionnaire that had been severally used in other research projects. Fifty-four research assistants were recruited and trained for five days to administer survey questionnaires. The research assistants were trained on the rules and ethics involved in data collection. They were paired to collect data with both paper and android tablets. Electronic copies of the questionnaire were built on SurveyCTO and the survey data was collected over a period of two weeks.\",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/cross-sectional-survey-data-of-adolescent-sexual-and-reproductive-health-in-nigeria-2018\",\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-854374\"],\"keywords\":[\"ADOLESCENTS\",\"SEXUAL HEALTH\",\"REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\",\"CONTRACEPTIVES\",\"SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR\",\"TEENAGE PREGNANCY\",\"ABORTION\"],\"temporalCoverage\":\"2018-08-15/2018-08-28\"}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"c:[\"$\",\"$5\",null,{\"fallback\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":\"Loading...\"}],\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$L16\",null,{\"strategy\":\"beforeInteractive\",\"id\":\"structured-data\",\"type\":\"application/ld+json\",\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"$17\"}}],\"$L18\"]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"19:I[78977,[\"9692\",\"static/js/9692.83f9877c.js\",\"1759\",\"static/js/1759.b13f3ee1.js\",\"690\",\"static/js/690.e023e61b.js\",\"3535\",\"static/js/3535.878ceef2.js\",\"5332\",\"static/js/5332.4ca3e6c6.js\",\"2410\",\"static/js/2410.ec36c5aa.js\",\"5183\",\"static/js/5183.9f1a7545.js\",\"5738\",\"static/js/5738.d28a9943.js\",\"3055\",\"static/js/3055.2a4989ee.js\",\"8977\",\"static/js/8977.d520dad7.js\",\"6387\",\"static/js/app/items/%5Bslug%5D/page.0819d17d.js\"],\"default\"]\n1a:Tb37,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"A cross-sectional survey of adolescents and heads of households was done in six urban and rural local government areas in Ebonyi state, Nigeria in August 2018.
