The relevant questions included students' perception of the impact on their learning of time spent travelling, the attitudes of others to their study, their social life, their own study skills.  Care was taken to keep open the possibility that such factors may have positive effects for some students, even though the normal expectation was that they would impose constraints on learning.

The questionnaire included sections from The Constructivist Learning Environment Survey (Taylor, Fraser, and Fisher, 1997): this closely matched the socially constructed view of learning that was central to the project.  Despite the Bourdieuian theoretical framework of the project no attempt was made to explore notions of habitus, field and cultural capital through the questionnaire, because even within a specific learning site, relevant questions could not be sufficiently contextualised to be meaningful.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Cultures of Learning in Further Education, 2001-2003"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Cultures of Learning in Further Education, 2001-2003"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/cultures-of-learning-in-further-education-2001-2003"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Cultures of Learning in Further Education, 2001-2003"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Cultures of Learning in Further Education, 2001-2003"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
