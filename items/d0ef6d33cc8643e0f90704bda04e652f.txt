12:T41d,This data collection consists of aggregate survey data, on attitudes and behaviour of regular motorists in Great Britain based on face-to-face and on-line research, carried out each year since 1989. 
The RAC Report on motoring is an on-going survey of Britain’s motorists published by RAC the motoring services company which provides recovery, insurance and other services to over 8 million private and business motorists.  The Report started as the Lex Report on Motoring in 1989 and in 2000 changed its name to the RAC Report on Motoring when Lex Service PLC, a motor retailing and leasing company, acquired the RAC Motoring Services and changed its name to RAC plc.Since 1989, data have been collected annually on the attitudes and behaviour of Britain's motorists by means of initially face to face and later  on-line.  The sample is typically between 1000 and 2000 motorists each year.
Until 1999, the results were published as the Lex Report on Motoring, subsequently the RAC Report on Motoring.  The annual reports are typically 100 pages long.13:T41d,This data collection consists of aggregate survey data, on attitudes and behaviour of regular motorists in Great Britain based on face-to-face and on-line research, carried out each year since 1989.
