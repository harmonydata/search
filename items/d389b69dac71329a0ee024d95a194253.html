The aims of the survey are as follows:
to monitor the physical quality of Scotland&#x27;s housing stock at a national level over time;
to contribute to the understanding of the factors which influence the physical condition of the housing stock;

to explore relationships between investment and stock condition both at an individual and national level;
to provide an information resource which can be drawn on for policy development in all areas of housing which relate to individual households, dwellings and the relationship between them.

The 2002 survey consisted of two parts: a social interview (conducted with the Highest Income Householder or his/her spouse) and a subsequent physical inspection carried out by a trained building professional.

For the third edition, the data and documentation were updated and two &#x27;Complex Sample Plan&#x27; SPSS syntax files were deposited, which may be used to estimate population parameters (see User Guide for full details).

The social interview covered a range of topics, including:
household composition;
tenure, previous moves and intention to move;
self-reported health status and respiratory health;
work done to the dwelling;
heating arrangements, their use and costs;
housing costs;
satisfaction with the home and the local environment;
existing adaptations and the need for others;
employment status and income.

The physical inspection focused on:
the basic description of the dwelling;
the material used in construction;
the state of repair of the internal, external and common parts (where relevant);
the amenities and services present;
heating systems and insulation;
whether or not the dwelling complied with the Barrier Free Standard;
whether or not the dwelling complied with the Tolerable Standard."/><meta property="og:title" content="Scottish House Condition Survey, 2002"/><meta property="og:description" content="The Scottish House Condition Survey (SHCS) is the largest single housing survey undertaken in Scotland and the only national study to look at the physical condition of dwellings as well as interviewing occupiers.
