This grant funded a programme of research investigating the relationship between early reading development and a range of phonological language skills. In particular, it examined the theory that a proximal cause of difficulty in learning to read is a failure to establish automatic associations between speech sounds and letters. 
1.	A cross-sectional study of 155 children aged 5-7 years established that automatic activation of sounds by letters has already emerged following approximately one year of reading experience.
2.	A subsequent longitudinal study of 191 children during their first year at school showed that strong associative links between printed letters and the speech sounds they represent are in evidence as soon as children have learned letter-sound correspondences. 
It also found that letter-sound knowledge, phoneme awareness and RAN are strong independent predictors of variations in reading. These results corroborate previous research highlighting the important causal role phonological language skills play in learning to read. Moreover, the study found a bi-directional relationship between reading development and both phoneme awareness and non-alphanumeric RAN. This finding suggests that not only is the development of phonemically structured phonological representations critical for learning to read, but that reading experience, in turn, exerts a positive influence on the development of such representations. 

3.	A study of children with developmental dyslexia (N (dyslexia) = 20)  found evidence of equivalent levels of automatic letter-sound integration in children with dyslexia and both typically developing children matched for reading age and those matched for chronological age. 
4.	A study investigating the relationship between PAL and reading in 97 children aged 8 to 10 years. This study used six different PAL tasks to identify two distinct but correlated types of PAL; those involving auditory-articulatory associations and those involving visual-articulatory associations. Importantly, we showed that auditory-articulatory PAL was the stronger predictor of reading, providing evidence that the relationship between PAL and reading is driven by verbal, rather than visual-verbal, demands."/><meta property="og:title" content="The role of automatic letter-speech sound integration in reading development and dyslexia 2015-2017"/><meta property="og:description" content="Six data sets are included in this collection: (1)Cross-sectional data for a representative sample of 155 children (aged 5-7 years).
