12:T6b3,The General Teaching Council for England (GTCE), which closed at the end of March 2012, was the professional body for teachers in England. The GTCE provided teacher registration and awarded qualified teacher status (QTS), gave trainee teachers provisional registration, maintained professional standards and gave advice to government. The GTCE also regulated the teaching profession in England in the public interest, including investigating allegations of serious professional incompetence and unacceptable professional conduct reported to the organisation. From April 2012, the Department for Education took over some of the functions of the GTCE. Further information may be found on the GTCE website.

The Registered Teachers in England data comprise an anonymised selection of fields from the GTCE's Register of Teachers, the database created to service the work of the organisation from 2000 to 2012.  The database held all relevant details of teachers working in the field in England, their qualifications, places of work and any disciplinary sanctions relevant to their fitness to practice in English schools.  The UK Data Archive holds data from a survey series conducted by the GTCE, the Surveys of Teachers, 2004-2010, under SN 6890.

 The dataset consists of six data fields:registration category (provisional trainee or instructor, or Qualified Teacher)gender of teacher (male or female)age of teacher (five-year age bands))school Local Authority area)school type (using 'Edubase' database categories); school category and school phase)Calendar year in which Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) was awarded (for full registrants only)The data have been anonymised to comply with the Data Protection Act 1988.13:T6b3,The General Teaching Council for England (GTCE), which closed at the end of March 2012, was the professional body for teachers in England.
