Following the fielding of the questionnaire, 80 respondents were selected for an in-depth interview to probe factors further affecting quality of life. A year after the baseline survey, 38 interviewees had experienced changes, and were re-interviewed to see how these changes had affected their quality of life.\n\nThis qualitative data collection includes the baseline and follow-up interviews described above, but not the initial quality of life questionnaire.\n Topics covered include life history, family and siblings, educational background, childhood, adolescence, wartime experiences (World War II), marriage, children and family life, grandchildren, happiness and life satisfaction, quality of life issues, retirement and associated issues, income, home, convenience of appliances and mobility, travel, local area and neighbourhood, social participation, friends, leisure time activities, hobbies, social support, health and well-being, control and coping, outlook, happiness, attitudes to old age."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Adding Quality to Quantity: Quality of Life in Older Age, 2000-2002\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$12\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"Adding Quality to Quantity: Quality of Life in Older Age, 2000-2002\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"$13\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/d64d19862e6c46016e35c2b168230c0a\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:site_name\",\"content\":\"Academic Resource Discovery\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:locale\",\"content\":\"en_US\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:image:width\",\"content\":\"1200\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:image:height\",\"content\":\"630\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"og:image:alt\",\"content\":\"Adding Quality to Quantity: Quality of Life in Older Age, 2000-2002\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"website\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary_large_image\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"Adding Quality to Quantity: Quality of Life in Older Age, 2000-2002\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$14\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"17\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]]\nc:null\n"])</script></body></html>
