12:Tbc8,Background
The Society for Acute Medicine (SAM) Benchmark Audit (SAMBA) is a national benchmark audit of acute medical care. The aim of SAMBA20 is to describe the severity of illness of acute medical patients presenting to Acute Medicine within UK hospitals, speed of assessment, pathway and progress seven days after admission and to provide a comparison for each participating unit with the national average (or ‘benchmark’). On average >150 hospitals take part in this audit per year.
SAMBA20 winter audit measured adherence to some of the standards for acute medical care. Acute Medical Units work 24-hours per day and 365 days a year. They are the single largest point of entry for acute hospital admissions and most patients are at their sickest within the first 24-hours of admission. 
This dataset includes
•	Total number of patients assessed by acute medicine across ED, AMU and Ambulatory Care. 
•	Medical and nursing levels 
•	Severity of illness 
•	Timeliness in processes of care 
•	Clinical outcomes 7 days after admission
PIONEER geography
The West Midlands (WM) has a population of 5.9million & includes a diverse ethnic, socio-economic mix. There is a higher than average % of minority ethnic groups. WM has a large number of elderly residents but is the youngest population in the UK. There are particularly high rates of physical inactivity, obesity, smoking & diabetes. WM has a high prevalence of COPD, reflecting the high rates of smoking and industrial exposure. Each day >100,000 people are treated in hospital, see their GP or are cared for by the NHS. This is the SAMBA dataset from 4 NHS hospitals.
EHR University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) is one of the largest NHS Trusts in England, providing direct acute services & specialist care across four hospital sites, with 2.2 million patient episodes per year, 2750 beds & 100 ITU beds. UHB runs a fully electronic healthcare record (EHR) (PICS; Birmingham Systems), a shared primary & secondary care record (Your Care Connected) & a patient portal “My Health”.
Scope: These data come from Queen Elizabeth Hospitals Birmingham, Good Hope Hospital, Solihull Hospital and Heartlands Hospital. All admissions in a  pre-defined 24-hour period, the severity of illness, patient demographics, co-morbidity, acuity scores, serial, structured data pertaining to care process (timings, staff grades, specialty review, wards) all prescribed & administered treatments (fluids, antibiotics, inotropes, vasopressors, organ support), all outcomes.  
Available supplementary data:
More extensive data including granular serial physiology, bloods, conditions, interventions, treatments. Ambulance, 111, 999 data, synthetic data.
