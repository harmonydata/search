12:T99d,This machine-readable version of John Williams' <i>Digest of Welsh Historical Statistics</i> is the result of a collaboration between the Statistical Directorate of the National Assembly for Wales, the History Data Service and the Centre for Data Digitisation and Analysis at Queen's University Belfast.
John Williams' <i>Digest of Welsh Historical Statistics</i> is intended to provide a service for those working on the history of modern Wales. It arises from a belief that the quantitative element is a necessary and important part of the historical record; from an awareness that it was an aspect that was particularly inaccessible for scholars of Welsh history; and from a conviction that some encouragement in the use of quantitative material was necessary. It is modelled on the two volumes dedicated to British historical statistics: Mitchell, B.R. and Deane, P. (1962) <i>Abstract of British historical statistics</i> and Mitchell, B.R. and Jones, H.G. (1971) <i>Second abstract of British historical statistics</i>. Number of houses, inhabited, uninhabited (and building, 1811-1921), by county, 1801-1971
