12:T905,This project aimed to advance the understanding of the relationship between financial education and practice in London's financial district. Face-to-face semi structured interviews were conducted with managers and educators in a range of business education provides (business schools, professional associations and education companies), human resource managers and investment bankers engaged in business education in investment banks, and professional bodies involved in promoting the development of London as a international financial centre. Trade associates of investment bankers and organisations were also interviewed. 53 interviews were conducted but only 27 interviews were transcribed and made available. 

A desk based review and an online survey of education providers also took place in this study. Following these, 3 observations of financial business education teaching were conducted. Postgraduate business education and training has been identified by both academics and policy-makers as an important way of producing a skilled labour force that is seen as vital to maintaining London's competitive position as a leading international financial centre. However, relatively little is known about the nature of the links between such education and financial services practice. This research addresses this oversight by providing a theoretically informed assessment of the importance of professional financial education provided by business schools, specialist training companies and professional associations in shaping financial services practice. It focuses on the post-graduate education and training of corporate financiers working in London's financial services district. The research will use qualitative and quantitative methods including interviews, observation of business education courses, secondary data analysis and a survey of business education providers. This data will be used to develop understandings of: the ways financial theories move into financial practice; the types of educational institutions involved in this movement; and, how financial theories change as they move from 'classroom' settings into practice. It will also provide important information concerning the possibility for London to position itself as a leading centre of postgraduate, professional education.13:T905,This project aimed to advance the understanding of the relationship between financial education and practice in London's financial district.
