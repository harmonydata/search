The data were collected by the then Scottish Office, with the aim of building up a database of Scottish manufacturing.\nThe depositor has stated that no written records remain of how the data were gathered, but apparently  this was done by direct surveying of companies, analysis of press articles etc. The definition of a manufacturing unit is 'a single plant or site (i.e. not  a single company) with greater than ten employees'.\nThe database was discontinued because the Office for National Statistics  (ONS) had started producing a UK wide database which duplicated what the SRE  attempted to do in Scotland - this was the Annual Census of Production  (ACOP - more a survey, not a census), which commenced in 1983. ACOP is not currently held at the Data Archive.\nThe depositor of the SRE notes that it is does not appear to be possible to relate the SRE and ACOP to one  another, probably because of differences in the definition of a  'manufacturing unit': unfortunately this tends to  preclude extrapolation from the SRE to more recent times.  However the  SRE can be regarded as internally consistent, and so can be used to analyse time series from 1950 to 1993.  The dataset contains information on all Scottish enterprises with 11 or more employees which have Standard Industrial Classification 1992 (SIC92) codes between 15900 and 36999 - essentially manufacturing industries. The data are presented in two ways: firstly, categorised by the first two digits of the SIC92 codes. Numbers of both enterprises and employees are available.\nSecondly, the data are categorised by broad industrial group (Standard Industrial Classification) and ownership (UK or non-UK). Again, numbers of both enterprises and employees are available.
