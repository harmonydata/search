A survey by Carers UK suggests that 4 out of 5 carers are now providing more care for their relatives. While effective vaccines have been discovered, the reduction of services during the pandemic may mean that the future of social care for these families is uncertain and subject to change in the longer term.

We propose to ask family carers from across the UK and Ireland about their experiences and will then use this new learning to co-design a tailor-made support programme. We will do this by means of online focus groups with stakeholders using questions which have been co-designed with carers and our voluntary sector partners. The subsequently developed online programme will be tested for acceptability employing mixed methods and will be implemented across the UK and Ireland.27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2b"}]
