The Data Archive now contains data from twenty-four studies carried out within the comparative organisational research programme initiated at the University of Aston in 1961. Summary details of each study are listed below, including dates, location and type of organisations investigated.

04 data giving individual scores for each of the 160 items in the BOCI questionnaire.
05 data on managerial attitudes, behaviour and roles collected by means of the &#x27;The Executive in the Organisation&#x27; questionnaire as described in Child and Ellis (HR, 1973), Ellis and Child (JMS, October 1973).
