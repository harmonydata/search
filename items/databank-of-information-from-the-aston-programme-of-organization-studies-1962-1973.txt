The Data Archive now contains data from twenty-four studies carried out within the comparative organisational research programme initiated at the University of Aston in 1961. Summary details of each study are listed below, including dates, location and type of organisations investigated. There are six categories of data available from the databank and they are coded on the table as follows:
01 data on organisational structure and context collected by means of the original and complete Aston schedule, as reported by Pugh et al. (ASQ, June 1968), Pugh et al. (ASQ, March 1969) and Hickson et al. (ASQ, September 1969)-relevant references are available from the Archive.
02 data of organisational structure and context collected by means of a shortened version of the above schedule, as reported in Inkson et al. (ASQ, September 1970).
03 data giving total scores on each of the twenty Business Organisational Climate Index (BOCI) scales as defined by Payne and Pheysey (OBHP, January 1971).
04 data giving individual scores for each of the 160 items in the BOCI questionnaire.
05 data on managerial attitudes, behaviour and roles collected by means of the 'The Executive in the Organisation' questionnaire as described in Child and Ellis (HR, 1973), Ellis and Child (JMS, October 1973).
06 data collected by means of adaptations of the above instruments; also data additional to the above, including in some studies organisational performance data (marked 06P - but these are not, as yet, available from the Data Archive). These data are not directly comparable to those in any other study. The Aston Databank has been established under the supervision of Professor John Child, supported by a special grant from the ESRC. Mrs Ruth Goodkin and Mrs Pat Clark of the University of Aston Management Centre Research Unit have checked each study back to its raw data and recoded these where necessary into a standard format.
A detailed manual for users of the databank has also been prepared, and this is available for consultation at the Archive. The University of Aston will continue to enter new data when available and as time permits. It is believed that the Aston Databank comprises the largest standardised set of comparative organisational data anywhere in the world, available for scholars for secondary analysis or as a point of comparison for future studies. Contact the Archive for further information.
