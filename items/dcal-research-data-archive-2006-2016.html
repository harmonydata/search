Based at University College London (UCL) and funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), DCAL places sign languages and Deaf people in the centre of the general understanding of how language and communication work within linguistics, psychology, and child development.

Deafness is an important model for exploring questions in linguistics, cognitive sciences, and in neuroscience, and this is now much more widely recognised (thanks in large part to DCAL&#x27;s research efforts over the last five years). The vast majority of research studies on language and thought are based on languages which are spoken and heard, and DCAL&#x27;s research provides a unique perspective on language and thought based on Deaf people&#x27;s communication. 

DCAL is committed to knowledge-exchange relating to its research agenda with professional groups who work with d/Deaf individuals and organisations of and for the d/Deaf. The research programme also follows clinical developments in relation to hearing intervention, especially cochlear implantation, as this changes the experience of deafness.

Two overarching themes drive DCAL&#x27;s research: 
(1) How is communication shaped by deafness and the use of sign language?; and 
(2) How does deafness and early language experience impact on cognitive functions beyond language? 

Both themes consider the effects of deafness, delayed language development, and sign language use across the lifespan by studying children, adolescents, and adults, including those with impaired signing, and compare this to both hearing and deaf non-signers and behavioural and neural levels.
