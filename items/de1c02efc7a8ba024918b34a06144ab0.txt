12:T12e7,The aim of these studies is to examine the positions of the low paid, the subemployed (men and women unemployed for over 4 weeks in the last 12 months), the disabled and immigrants in two local labour markets. There were two main sources of data:
1) All members not in full-time education and under 71 of a simple random sample of households in 2 urban areas (230).

ii) subemployed (unemployed for more than 4 weeks in last 12 months)
iii) disabled
iv) immigrants (not born in UK or Eire)
