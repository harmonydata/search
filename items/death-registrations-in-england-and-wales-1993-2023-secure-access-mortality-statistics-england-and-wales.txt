2e:Tc69,The Death Registrations in England and Wales, 1993-2023: Secure Access study includes annual data files for all deaths registered in England and Wales from 1993 to 2022. Death registration is a legal requirement under the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1836. The registration of deaths occurring in England and Wales is a service carried out by the Local Registration Service in partnership with the General Register Office (GRO). Information collected at death registration is recorded on the Registration Online (RON) system by registrars. The information supplied at the time of registration is from 1 of 4 sources:details supplied by the doctor when certifying a deathdetails supplied by the informant to the registrardetails supplied by a coroner to the registrar following an investigationdetails derived from the information supplied aboveDeath registration data are passed to the Office for National Statistics electronically from GRO for statistical purposes. Each annual dataset is a static file of death registration records available at the time the annual subset was closed. Revisions to records can still be made after the subset has been finalised but these will not be reflected in the annual dataset or used to compile statistics. The annual datasets include deaths that have been registered in that calendar year, a small percentage of these deaths may have occurred in previous years (2.9% in 2001 and 4.8% in 2015). Deaths to those usually resident in England or Wales who die abroad are not included in the dataset. Deaths registered in England and Wales to those whose usual residence is outside England and Wales are included.

Further information about mortality statistics is available from the Office for National Statistics deaths web page.

Prospective users will need to apply for access to this controlled access data via the UK Data Service Secure Lab. Further information is available on the Apply to Access Controlled Data in SecureLab web pages.
