Various visual and sensory prompts were used to elicit discussion in interviews and reminiscence groups, including vintage garments, photograph albums, images and samples of fabric. The study also involved observations and informal discussions, which facilitated the inclusion of people with more advanced dementia. In addition, qualitative interviews were conducted with family carers/relatives and care-workers. The sample included 32 case studies of people with dementia, 29 family carers and relatives, 28 care home workers, and representatives from two clothing companies.
