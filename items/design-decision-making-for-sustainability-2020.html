There is also a focus in prescriptive design literature on how to take stakeholders’ values, including designers’ values, into account in design decision-making. For example, the Value Sensitive Design method proposes that stakeholders’ values can be identified and used to inform design decisions.

This project seeks to examine these three psychological concepts of decision-making, personal values, and responsibility from the perspective of how they are constructed and managed in talk about sustainable design, using a discursive psychology (DP) approach. While interviews are commonly used to study how designers work, they are usually analysed using content analysis of participants’ talk, whereas DP enables examination of both sides of the interview interaction and takes into account how prior talk influences what is said. Talk about design has been collected for this project using semi-structured interviews with sustainability-focused product designers, and from video recordings of panel discussions at design conferences. Extracts of data have been transcribed using Jefferson notations, to indicate features such as change of pace, volume, pauses, and laughter, to give richer insights into the interactional talk and actions. Analysis of extracts focuses on patterns in how designers talk about design decisions and other types of decisions, how they portray the role of personal values in their work, and how different types of responsibility are constructed regarding responsibility for sustainability in design. Findings based on common sequences noticed in interactional talk provide insights into the designers’ portrayal of their roles and identities."/><meta property="og:title" content="Design Decision-making for Sustainability, 2020"/><meta property="og:description" content="There has been a great deal of focus in the sustainability sector in recent years on the importance of the role of design, and of making better design decisions, in order to achieve sustainable production and consumption.

Talk about design has been collected for this project using semi-structured interviews with sustainability-focused product designers, and from video recordings of panel discussions at design conferences. Extracts of data have been transcribed using Jefferson notations, to indicate features such as change of pace, volume, pauses, and laughter, to give richer insights into the interactional talk and actions. Analysis of extracts focuses on patterns in how designers talk about design decisions and other types of decisions, how they portray the role of personal values in their work, and how different types of responsibility are constructed regarding responsibility for sustainability in design. Findings based on common sequences noticed in interactional talk provide insights into the designers’ portrayal of their roles and identities.\",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/design-decision-making-for-sustainability-2020\",\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-855100\"],\"keywords\":[\"DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY\",\"SUSTAINABILITY\",\"INTERVIEWS (DATA COLLECTION)\",\"DECISION MAKING\",\"MORAL VALUES\",\"RESPONSIBILITY\",\"IDENTITY\",\"ROLES\"],\"temporalCoverage\":\"2020-07-01/2020-10-31\"}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"c:[\"$\",\"$5\",null,{\"fallback\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":\"Loading...\"}],\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$L16\",null,{\"strategy\":\"beforeInteractive\",\"id\":\"structured-data\",\"type\":\"application/ld+json\",\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"$17\"}}],\"$L18\"]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"19:I[78977,[\"9692\",\"static/js/9692.83f9877c.js\",\"1759\",\"static/js/1759.b13f3ee1.js\",\"690\",\"static/js/690.e023e61b.js\",\"3535\",\"static/js/3535.878ceef2.js\",\"5332\",\"static/js/5332.4ca3e6c6.js\",\"2410\",\"static/js/2410.ec36c5aa.js\",\"5183\",\"static/js/5183.9f1a7545.js\",\"5738\",\"static/js/5738.d28a9943.js\",\"3055\",\"static/js/3055.87b66c06.js\",\"8977\",\"static/js/8977.25169e64.js\",\"6387\",\"static/js/app/items/%5Bslug%5D/page.0819d17d.js\"],\"default\"]\n1a:Tbaf,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"There has been a great deal of focus in the sustainability sector in recent years on the importance of the role of design, and of making better design decisions, in order to achieve sustainable production and consumption.
