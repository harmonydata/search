Numerous tools and methods are offered to designers to help improve their decision-making taking into account multiple criteria. Yet there is recognition in science and technology literature, often based on ethnographic research, that professional designers working in industry may have limited power to make design decisions in practice, and that instead a complex network of stakeholders is involved. Related to this, there have been ongoing debates about whether designers can be responsible for the impacts of the things they design, such as the impacts on the environment, if their agency to make decisions is limited. Yet there is limited empirical research on how designers themselves report their roles in design decisions and who may be responsible for decisions. There is also a focus in prescriptive design literature on how to take stakeholders’ values, including designers’ values, into account in design decision-making.

Talk about design has been collected for this project using semi-structured interviews with sustainability-focused product designers, and from video recordings of panel discussions at design conferences. Extracts of data have been transcribed using Jefferson notations, to indicate features such as change of pace, volume, pauses, and laughter, to give richer insights into the interactional talk and actions. Analysis of extracts focuses on patterns in how designers talk about design decisions and other types of decisions, how they portray the role of personal values in their work, and how different types of responsibility are constructed regarding responsibility for sustainability in design. Findings based on common sequences noticed in interactional talk provide insights into the designers’ portrayal of their roles and identities.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Design Decision-making for Sustainability, 2020"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Design Decision-making for Sustainability, 2020"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/design-decision-making-for-sustainability-2020"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Design Decision-making for Sustainability, 2020"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Design Decision-making for Sustainability, 2020"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
