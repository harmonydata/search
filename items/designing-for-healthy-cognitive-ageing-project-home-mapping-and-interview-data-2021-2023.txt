To contribute to this, the team aimed to find out how older people currently live in their homes and what they find positive and negative about them. The home mapping data collection exercise in DesHCA focused on learning about older people’s experiences of living in their homes as they age. The goal was to gather insights from  older people to create a clear picture of what people wanted, needed, and worried about in regards to adapting their home. A creative mapping method was used to explore how older people thought about, felt about, and used their homes. The Participants were re-contacted six months later in Wave 2 of data collection and asked about any changes to their home or health since the first interview.  \n\nParticipants were asked to create a map of their home (which could include taking photographs, filming, or drawing) and we also interviewed them about their home. Most participants made their creative map during the interview, allowing researchers to ask questions about specific areas and items that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. This approach allowed the creative mapping interviews to capture a lot of data on the physical aspects of people’s homes, including what they liked and disliked about their home, what worked well for them, and what they would like to change in the future if they could. They also delved further, looking beyond the building itself to learn about how participants liked to use the different areas in their home, what kind of activities they liked to do there, and how their home had changed over time.\n\nThe data consist of: \n-16 home maps drawn by 19 participants, \n-46 Wave 1 interview transcripts (11 of which involve two people)\n-an overview table summarising changes reported since Wave 1 interviews, and \n-4 interview transcripts from full Wave 2 interviews.As we age, many of us will experience cognitive changes, and for some of us, these will develop into dementia. We know that people's homes can make the experience of cognitive changes more difficult, or can enable continuing inclusion and sense of self-worth and self-esteem. DesHCA  worked with people experiencing ageing and cognitive change and those who design and develop housing. DesHCA identified housing innovations that can support living better for longer with cognitive change. Our emphasis on healthy cognitive ageing goes beyond narrow conceptions of 'dementia-friendly design' into a more expansive and inclusive approach to housing innovation.\n\nThe multidisciplinary DesHCA team involved stakeholders from all areas of housing provision, including people experiencing ageing and cognitive change, architects and designers, housing experts, planners, builders and housing providers. Older people were integral to DesHCA and their health was at its heart. The project designed homes that act as demonstrators and test-beds for innovations to support healthy cognitive ageing. These designs have been developed and evaluated from stakeholder points of view, then considered at a larger scale to examine their real-world feasibility. DesHCA is feeding directly into the UK and Scottish Government City Region Deal for Central Scotland (Stirling and Clackmannanshire), providing groundwork for local housing developments. The focus of this is sustainable, lifetime health, community and economic development, addressing deprivation and inequality.\n\nTo achieve these aims, DesHCA took a co-production approach, with the whole team working to identify innovations that engage with their real-world experiences and aspirations. We used a range of data collection methods and produced analyses informed the design of the demonstrator houses. These designs evolved as stakeholders interacted with them and provided feedback from their different points of view. To collect data, we asked older people to map and evaluate their own homes and to experience and comment on new design features using virtual reality (VR). They then collaborated with builders, architects and housing providers in VR workshops to identify practical, realistic and affordable designs that can support healthy cognitive ageing, and therefore longer healthy, independent life. Partners came together in interactive workshops to convert designs into plans within a fictional town, building and retrofitting homes, creating services and managing budgets. We demonstrated how designs can work out in the real world, and how to bring together the various interests involved.

Older people were integral to DesHCA and their health was at its heart. The project designed homes that act as demonstrators and test-beds for innovations to support healthy cognitive ageing. These designs have been developed and evaluated from stakeholder points of view, then considered at a larger scale to examine their real-world feasibility. DesHCA is feeding directly into the UK and Scottish Government City Region Deal for Central Scotland (Stirling and Clackmannanshire), providing groundwork for local housing developments. The focus of this is sustainable, lifetime health, community and economic development, addressing deprivation and inequality.

To achieve these aims, DesHCA took a co-production approach, with the whole team working to identify innovations that engage with their real-world experiences and aspirations. We used a range of data collection methods and produced analyses informed the design of the demonstrator houses. These designs evolved as stakeholders interacted with them and provided feedback from their different points of view. To collect data, we asked older people to map and evaluate their own homes and to experience and comment on new design features using virtual reality (VR). They then collaborated with builders, architects and housing providers in VR workshops to identify practical, realistic and affordable designs that can support healthy cognitive ageing, and therefore longer healthy, independent life. Partners came together in interactive workshops to convert designs into plans within a fictional town, building and retrofitting homes, creating services and managing budgets. We demonstrated how designs can work out in the real world, and how to bring together the various interests involved. Throughout, issues of costs were considered, to inform business planning and help make decisions on implementation of the new designs.17:T126f,The DesHCA project aimed to identify supportive home designs that older people would find acceptable. To contribute to this, the team aimed to find out how older people currently live in their homes and what they find positive and negative about them. The home mapping data collection exercise in DesHCA focused on learning about older people’s experiences of living in their homes as they age. The goal was to gather insights from  older people to create a clear picture of what people wanted, needed, and worried about in regards to adapting their home. A creative mapping method was used to explore how older people thought about, felt about, and used their homes. The Participants were re-contacted six months later in Wave 2 of data collection and asked about any changes to their home or health since the first interview.  

Participants were asked to create a map of their home (which could include taking photographs, filming, or drawing) and we also interviewed them about their home. Most participants made their creative map during the interview, allowing researchers to ask questions about specific areas and items that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. This approach allowed the creative mapping interviews to capture a lot of data on the physical aspects of people’s homes, including what they liked and disliked about their home, what worked well for them, and what they would like to change in the future if they could. They also delved further, looking beyond the building itself to learn about how participants liked to use the different areas in their home, what kind of activities they liked to do there, and how their home had changed over time.

The data consist of: 
-16 home maps drawn by 19 participants, 
-46 Wave 1 interview transcripts (11 of which involve two people)
-an overview table summarising changes reported since Wave 1 interviews, and 
-4 interview transcripts from full Wave 2 interviews.As we age, many of us will experience cognitive changes, and for some of us, these will develop into dementia. We know that people's homes can make the experience of cognitive changes more difficult, or can enable continuing inclusion and sense of self-worth and self-esteem. DesHCA  worked with people experiencing ageing and cognitive change and those who design and develop housing. DesHCA identified housing innovations that can support living better for longer with cognitive change. Our emphasis on healthy cognitive ageing goes beyond narrow conceptions of 'dementia-friendly design' into a more expansive and inclusive approach to housing innovation.
