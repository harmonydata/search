Chronic loneliness could arise from a cognitive bias towards forming threatening over benign interpretations of social situations, leading to a behavioural bias favouring social withdrawal over social approach, thereby facilitating and maintaining persistent loneliness. We have developed an age-appropriate assessment tool, the Social Response Biases in Loneliness for Young Adults (SRBL-YA), for measuring these cognitive and behavioural biases. The SRBL-YA consists of 12 open-ended ambiguous loneliness-relevant scenarios that are followed by both a negative and a positive resolution to the scenario. When completing the SRBL-YA, one rates the likelihood of each of the resolutions occurring, on a 5-point Likert scale, from “extremely unlikely” to “extremely likely”.\n\nThe data presented here consists of an online survey, collected for the purpose of examining the psychometric properties of the SRBL-YA. Specifically, the factor structure of the SRBL-YA and its association with loneliness, depression, anxiety and social anxiety were examined in a sample of University students (n=416). \n\nConfirmatory factor analysis indicated that a 7-item scale may improve upon the 12-item version, however, the reliability of both versions was somewhat low (α = 0.68-0.81). Both versions of the SRBL-YA showed convergent validity with loneliness, even when accounting for depressive, anxiety and social anxiety symptoms, but require further validation in independent samples.Loneliness is a negative emotion that occurs when one perceives his/her social relationships and networks to fall short of his/her social needs. Because loneliness is thought to have evolved as a powerful motivator to connect with others and solicit their support, it may arise during periods of life that are characterised by social turbulence. One such period is youth, where there are major changes in the external social environment such as the amount of time spent with peers and in the emergence of new peer hierarchies and cliques - but also in internal factors, such as the need for peer approval and the aversiveness of peer rejection. Accordingly, as these social changes may bring about instability in social relationships, loneliness can arise to facilitate re-connection with others, and therefore be considered a normal part of growing up for many young people. However for some young people loneliness can be intense, upsetting and persistent, predicting poorer mental and physical health. Delivering interventions to manage loneliness in youth is therefore crucial, made more so as this may reflect a period of plasticity for learning more effective ways of regulating emotions. As some negative thinking styles such as a tendency to endorse threatening over benign expectations and explanations of ambiguous social situations is associated with youth loneliness, measuring and targeting these earlier in life may be a powerful 'vaccine' for reducing the risk of loneliness.\n\nHowever before any early interventions programs are planned around the targeting of threat interpretations, there are some key questions that need to addressed. First there is only one study showing that threat interpretations precede and predict risk for loneliness rather than reflect consequences. Disentangling these roles may inform whether it is useful to modify threat interpretations in order to alter loneliness. In addition it is not clear whether threat interpretations affect loneliness by influencing social withdrawal behaviour, as theories would suggest. Second all studies investigating threat interpretations in relation to loneliness have used questionnaires about hypothetical social scenarios rather than directly assess thoughts to real-life events. Establishing the relationship between threat interpretations and loneliness in everyday life is important, again for informing whether it is helpful to modify these thinking styles to alter lonely feelings. Finally, although methods have been developed for challenging threat interpretations related to other social behavioural problems like social anxiety, it is not clear if these methods are as relevant to and well tolerated by young people who are lonely.\n\nThe goals of this research are to address these questions.

In addition it is not clear whether threat interpretations affect loneliness by influencing social withdrawal behaviour, as theories would suggest. Second all studies investigating threat interpretations in relation to loneliness have used questionnaires about hypothetical social scenarios rather than directly assess thoughts to real-life events. Establishing the relationship between threat interpretations and loneliness in everyday life is important, again for informing whether it is helpful to modify these thinking styles to alter lonely feelings. Finally, although methods have been developed for challenging threat interpretations related to other social behavioural problems like social anxiety, it is not clear if these methods are as relevant to and well tolerated by young people who are lonely.

The goals of this research are to address these questions. Three studies will be performed. First a longitudinal study of around 1000 young people will be conducted to examine the cross-time relationships between threat interpretations, social withdrawal and loneliness with a nested interview study supplementing quantitative data.17:T1206,Youth loneliness is common and associated with poorer health and wellbeing. Chronic loneliness could arise from a cognitive bias towards forming threatening over benign interpretations of social situations, leading to a behavioural bias favouring social withdrawal over social approach, thereby facilitating and maintaining persistent loneliness. We have developed an age-appropriate assessment tool, the Social Response Biases in Loneliness for Young Adults (SRBL-YA), for measuring these cognitive and behavioural biases. The SRBL-YA consists of 12 open-ended ambiguous loneliness-relevant scenarios that are followed by both a negative and a positive resolution to the scenario. When completing the SRBL-YA, one rates the likelihood of each of the resolutions occurring, on a 5-point Likert scale, from “extremely unlikely” to “extremely likely”.

The data presented here consists of an online survey, collected for the purpose of examining the psychometric properties of the SRBL-YA. Specifically, the factor structure of the SRBL-YA and its association with loneliness, depression, anxiety and social anxiety were examined in a sample of University students (n=416). 

Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a 7-item scale may improve upon the 12-item version, however, the reliability of both versions was somewhat low (α = 0.68-0.81). Both versions of the SRBL-YA showed convergent validity with loneliness, even when accounting for depressive, anxiety and social anxiety symptoms, but require further validation in independent samples.Loneliness is a negative emotion that occurs when one perceives his/her social relationships and networks to fall short of his/her social needs. Because loneliness is thought to have evolved as a powerful motivator to connect with others and solicit their support, it may arise during periods of life that are characterised by social turbulence. One such period is youth, where there are major changes in the external social environment such as the amount of time spent with peers and in the emergence of new peer hierarchies and cliques - but also in internal factors, such as the need for peer approval and the aversiveness of peer rejection. Accordingly, as these social changes may bring about instability in social relationships, loneliness can arise to facilitate re-connection with others, and therefore be considered a normal part of growing up for many young people. However for some young people loneliness can be intense, upsetting and persistent, predicting poorer mental and physical health. Delivering interventions to manage loneliness in youth is therefore crucial, made more so as this may reflect a period of plasticity for learning more effective ways of regulating emotions. As some negative thinking styles such as a tendency to endorse threatening over benign expectations and explanations of ambiguous social situations is associated with youth loneliness, measuring and targeting these earlier in life may be a powerful 'vaccine' for reducing the risk of loneliness.

However before any early interventions programs are planned around the targeting of threat interpretations, there are some key questions that need to addressed. First there is only one study showing that threat interpretations precede and predict risk for loneliness rather than reflect consequences. Disentangling these roles may inform whether it is useful to modify threat interpretations in order to alter loneliness.
