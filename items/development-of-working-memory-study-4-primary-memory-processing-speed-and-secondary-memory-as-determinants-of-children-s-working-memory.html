</title><meta name="description" content="The aim of this study was to build on the work done in the three previous experiments on the grant that looked, in turn, at the development in children of primary memory, processing speed, and secondary memory.  Measures taken from these earlier studies were used in this work to determine which of these factors underpinned working memory development in children, and the extent to which they mediated the relationship between working memory and academic attainment.

A total of 218 children in school years 2 and 3 completed a range of experimental measures tapping primary memory, various aspects of processing speed, and secondary memory.  Experimental measures of short-term memory (&#x27;simple span&#x27;) and working memory (&#x27;complex span&#x27;) were also given, as were a standardised test of mathematics [Numerical Operations subtest of the WIAT-II UK], a novel measure of reading comprehension, and a standardised test of classroom behaviour [Conners’ 3 Teacher Short Form]
This data collection contains the data from the fourth of four studies conducted on the associated ESRC grant (see Related Resources).The aim of this project is to build on previous psychological research with both children and adults to provide the most comprehensive model to date of the factors involved in the development of working memory performance in children. In doing so, the project will investigate the extent to which these factors are separable or inter-related. Also the project will assess how these factors contribute to mediating the strong relationships commonly observed between working memory and academic attainment.

The research has four specific objectives:

To determine whether age-related changes in short-term memory capacity are related to working memory development.

To determine how age-related changes in processing speed are related to working memory development.

To determine whether age-related changes in long-term memory utilisation are related to working memory development.

To determine which of the above factors mediate the relationship between working memory performance and educational attainment.

These objectives will be met in a set of empirical studies, using both existing and novel experimental measures. These measures will be related to academic attainment and measures of classroom behaviour.  Each study will involve large samples of children in two age groups (around 5 and around 9 years of age)."/><meta property="og:title" content="The development of working memory, Study 4: Primary memory, processing speed, and secondary memory as determinants of children&#x27;s working memory

development of working memory, Study 4: Primary memory, processing speed, and secondary memory as determinants of children's working memory\\n\",\"description\":\"The aim of this study was to build on the work done in the three previous experiments on the grant that looked, in turn, at the development in children of primary memory, processing speed, and secondary memory.  Measures taken from these earlier studies were used in this work to determine which of these factors underpinned working memory development in children, and the extent to which they mediated the relationship between working memory and academic attainment.\\n\\nA total of 218 children in school years 2 and 3 completed a range of experimental measures tapping primary memory, various aspects of processing speed, and secondary memory.  Experimental measures of short-term memory ('simple span') and working memory ('complex span') were also given, as were a standardised test of mathematics [Numerical Operations subtest of the WIAT-II UK], a novel measure of reading comprehension, and a standardised test of classroom behaviour [Conners’ 3 Teacher Short Form]\\nThis data collection contains the data from the fourth of four studies conducted on the associated ESRC grant (see Related Resources).The aim of this project is to build on previous psychological research with both children and adults to provide the most comprehensive model to date of the factors involved in the development of working memory performance in children. In doing so, the project will investigate the extent to which these factors are separable or inter-related. Also the project will assess how these factors contribute to mediating the strong relationships commonly observed between working memory and academic attainment.\\n\\nThe research has four specific objectives:\\n\\nTo determine whether age-related changes in short-term memory capacity are related to working memory development.\\n\\nTo determine how age-related changes in processing speed are related to working memory development.\\n\\nTo determine whether age-related changes in long-term memory utilisation are related to working memory development.\\n\\nTo determine which of the above factors mediate the relationship between working memory performance and educational attainment.\\n\\nThese objectives will be met in a set of empirical studies, using both existing and novel experimental measures. These measures will be related to academic attainment and measures of classroom behaviour.  Each study will involve large samples of children in two age groups (around 5 and around 9 years of age).\",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/development-of-working-memory-study-4-primary-memory-processing-speed-and-secondary-memory-as-determinants-of-children-s-working-memory\",\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-852038\"],\"keywords\":[\"MEMORY\",\"CHILD PSYCHOLOGY\"],\"temporalCoverage\":\"2011-01-01/2015-07-21\"}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1b:T97d,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"The aim of this study was to build on the work done in the three previous experiments on the grant that looked, in turn, at the development in children of primary memory, processing speed, and secondary memory.
