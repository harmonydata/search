To determine which of the above factors mediate the relationship between working memory performance and educational attainment.

These objectives will be met in a set of empirical studies, using both existing and novel experimental measures. These measures will be related to academic attainment and measures of classroom behaviour.  Each study will involve large samples of children in two age groups (around 5 and around 9 years of age).e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"The development of working memory, Study 4: Primary memory, processing speed, and secondary memory as determinants of children's working memory\n"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"The development of working memory, Study 4: Primary memory, processing speed, and secondary memory as determinants of children's working memory\n"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/development-of-working-memory-study-4-primary-memory-processing-speed-and-secondary-memory-as-determinants-of-children-s-working-memory"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"The development of working memory, Study 4: Primary memory, processing speed, and secondary memory as determinants of children's working memory\n"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The development of working memory, Study 4: Primary memory, processing speed, and secondary memory as determinants of children's working memory\n"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
