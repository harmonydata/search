This data collection contains verbatim transcriptions of eight focus group discussions held with community members in East and West Belfast on the theme of political devolution and its impact on their lives, as discussed above.
 Topics covered in the focus group discussions include various issues concerning identity and the Northern Irish community, including the Peace Process, the Good Friday Agreement, crime, the community and terrorism, political affairs and responses of politicians to community matters, sectarianism and religious issues, employment and career opportunities for Protestants and Catholics, and other questions of identity and life in Northern Ireland.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Devolution and Identity in Northern Ireland: a Longitudinal Discursive Study, 2003-2004"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Devolution and Identity in Northern Ireland: a Longitudinal Discursive Study, 2003-2004"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/devolution-and-identity-in-northern-ireland-a-longitudinal-discursive-study-2003-2004"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Devolution and Identity in Northern Ireland: a Longitudinal Discursive Study, 2003-2004"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Devolution and Identity in Northern Ireland: a Longitudinal Discursive Study, 2003-2004"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
