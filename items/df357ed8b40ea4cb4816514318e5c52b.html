Study collaborators include the UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies, the University of Oxford, and Birkbeck, University of London.  Data from Wave 1 of the Children of the 2020s study are available for research purposes via the ONS Secure Research Service.Researchers who wish to use Children of the 2020s data will need to become an accredited researcher, and then apply for an accredited research project.The Wave 1 Technical Report is available from the Department for Education website. It includes the questionnaire content as well as a description of the development, implementation, administration, and data management of the first wave of the survey.If you’ve been contacted to take part in Children of the 2020s, please head to the study website to find out more about what the study involves.The Children of the 2020s study sample has been drawn from HMRC Child Benefit records.

The study is a five-wave longitudinal survey study of children from nine months to five years.The first wave of data collection was face to face and took place when the cohort child was nine months old (Wave 1).A second face-to-face data collection will take place at age three (Wave 3).Non-face-to-face modes will be administered using a sequential mixed mode design with online and telephone surveys when children are aged two (Wave 2), four (Wave 4) and five (Wave 5).Data collection will include assessments of:The study includes ongoing linkages to both parent and baby education and health records.Alongside the main survey, the study will collect additional data using an innovative smartphone app called BabySteps. BabySteps will enable us to capture rich developmental and home environment measures between study waves at low cost. Measures will include a combination of short questionnaires and video/audio recordings.High quality, cleaned, and fully weighted datasets, along with data documentation and guidance following each wave of data collection will be produced, alongside non-response analyses and details of the weighting system applied.The Children of the 2020s study receives funding from the Department for Education.If you’ve been contacted to take part in the Children of the 2020s study, please head to the study website at children2020s.ipsos.com to find out more about what’s involved.A nationally representative sample of approximately 8,500 babies has been recruited from across England, with boosted representation of babies in the lowest quintile of disadvantage. We are surveying participants annually. The first data collection took place when the cohort members were nine months old. The final data collection will be when the children are age five.There will be a big focus on linking administrative data to the survey data we collect. With participants’ consent, we will link education data, held by the Department for Education, and NHS digital health records to the study data.The survey data we collect will be enriched with in-home observation and smartphone apps.

Study collaborators include the UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies, the University of Oxford, and Birkbeck, University of London.  Data from Wave 1 of the Children of the 2020s study are available for research purposes via the ONS Secure Research Service.Researchers who wish to use Children of the 2020s data will need to become an accredited researcher, and then apply for an accredited research project.The Wave 1 Technical Report is available from the Department for Education website. It includes the questionnaire content as well as a description of the development, implementation, administration, and data management of the first wave of the survey.If you’ve been contacted to take part in Children of the 2020s, please head to the study website to find out more about what the study involves.The Children of the 2020s study sample has been drawn from HMRC Child Benefit records.

The study is a five-wave longitudinal survey study of children from nine months to five years.The first wave of data collection was face to face and took place when the cohort child was nine months old (Wave 1).A second face-to-face data collection will take place at age three (Wave 3).Non-face-to-face modes will be administered using a sequential mixed mode design with online and telephone surveys when children are aged two (Wave 2), four (Wave 4) and five (Wave 5).Data collection will include assessments of:The study includes ongoing linkages to both parent and baby education and health records.Alongside the main survey, the study will collect additional data using an innovative smartphone app called BabySteps. BabySteps will enable us to capture rich developmental and home environment measures between study waves at low cost. Measures will include a combination of short questionnaires and video/audio recordings.High quality, cleaned, and fully weighted datasets, along with data documentation and guidance following each wave of data collection will be produced, alongside non-response analyses and details of the weighting system applied.The Children of the 2020s study receives funding from the Department for Education.If you’ve been contacted to take part in the Children of the 2020s study, please head to the study website at children2020s.ipsos.com to find out more about what’s involved.A nationally representative sample of approximately 8,500 babies has been recruited from across England, with boosted representation of babies in the lowest quintile of disadvantage. We are surveying participants annually. The first data collection took place when the cohort members were nine months old.
