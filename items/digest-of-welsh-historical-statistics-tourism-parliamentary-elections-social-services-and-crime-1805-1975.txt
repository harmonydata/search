John Williams' <i>Digest of Welsh Historical Statistics</i> is intended to provide a service for those working on the history of modern Wales. It arises from a belief that the quantitative element is a necessary and important part of the historical record; from an awareness that it was an aspect that was particularly inaccessible for scholars of Welsh history; and from a conviction that some encouragement in the use of quantitative material was necessary. It is modelled on the two volumes dedicated to British historical statistics: Mitchell, B.R. and Deane, P. (1962) <i>Abstract of British historical statistics</i> and Mitchell, B.R. and Jones, H.G. (1971) <i>Second abstract of British historical statistics</i>. Tourism. Percentage of British holiday-makers staying in each country for one night or more on holidays in Great Britain
