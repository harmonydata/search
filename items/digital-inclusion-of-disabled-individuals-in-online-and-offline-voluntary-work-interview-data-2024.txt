(2) identify effective principles to boost participation, inclusivity, and leverage the potential of digital technologies in the voluntary sector organisations. 

A mixed-methods approach is adopted for a more comprehensive understanding of the research problem. This included qualitative interviews and analysis that will provide deeper understanding and explanations for these patterns through analysis of the lived experiences of disabled adults and survey data analysis. 

The key findings included: 
•	Link Between Digital Inclusion and Volunteering: For disabled adults, being included in online and offline volunteering depends on how well they can access and use digital technology in general. The same devices, technologies, social support, and skills used in employment and other areas of life are often applied to volunteering. Because disabled adults often have less access to devices and the internet and use them less than non-disabled adults, they are more likely to miss out on volunteering opportunities that require it.
•	Digital Access and Divide: Most disabled adults in the UK are connected digitally, but the digital divide persists. Disabled adults face greater digital challenges and exclusion compared to non-disabled adults, with the disability digital gap remaining largely unchanged since 2018.
•	Digital exclusion: Nearly one million disabled adults don’t have Internet at home, 1.4 million don’t use the Internet, and about two million don’t own a smartphone or computer.
•	Frequency of Use and Online Exclusion: Disabled adults use the Internet less often than non-disabled adults and they are more likely to be left out of common online activities like browsing, emailing, social media, online banking, and streaming videos.
•	Double Disadvantage and Additional Challenges: Disabled people often come from groups that with already more limited access to the Internet and devices, such as older adults, those with low incomes, benefit recipients, renters from local authorities, people with less education and those living alone. On top of these existing barriers, being disabled means facing even more difficulties in accessing and using digital technology.
•	Individual Nature of Disability Experience with Digital Tools: Disabled adults’ experiences with digital tools are highly individual, shaped by factors such as impairment type, severity, presence of multiple impairments, and their social context.
•	Double-Edged Sword of Digital Technology and Online Volunteering: Digital technology is crucial for inclusion but can also be source of exclusion for those struggling with technology. Disabled adults are more inclined to engage in online volunteering, because of its accessibility. However, online volunteering also presents challenges that may deter some disabled volunteers. Despite some digital barriers, disabled adults show higher interest in online volunteering compared to non-disabled adults.
•	Importance of Internet Access for Engaging in Volunteering:  Internet access and usage are crucial for enabling disabled individuals to engage in volunteering, including both online and in-person opportunities. Those who use the Internet more frequently are more likely to volunteer, even after considering their socioeconomic background.
•	Internet Access, Use, Devices and Volunteering Hours and Frequency:  For disabled individuals, owning devices does not affect the number of volunteer hours. More frequent Internet use is linked to volunteering more hours, with exception of frequent Internet users (daily or weekly) who volunteer fewer hours. Device ownership and Internet use do not impact the frequency of volunteering.
•	Digital Barriers and Enablers of Volunteering:
o	Technology over-reliance: Over-reliance on technology can complicate volunteer journeys, especially when IT systems or support is unavailable or inadequate.
o	Technological assumptions: Organisations often assume people understand how to use technology and devices and may not recognise the need for support or training.1a:T129d,In today’s interconnected world, internet access is often considered critical for accessing work. However, reliance on the internet also poses challenges for some disabled people, who may be vulnerable to digital exclusion. This innovative project delivered by an interprofessional team of social scientists, voluntary sector organisations, vocational rehabilitation practitioners, disability researchers, disabled people, and digital engagement specialists examined digital inclusion of disabled adults in voluntary work. 

The project aimed to: 
(1) advance understanding of how digital inclusion of disabled individuals fosters social inclusion in online and offline voluntary work; and 
(2) identify effective principles to boost participation, inclusivity, and leverage the potential of digital technologies in the voluntary sector organisations.
