[Part 1: Alphabetical Section] (1884)- The Business Directory of London and provincial and foreign trade guide (l'Annuaire du Commerce de Londres), 1884. [Part 2: Classified Section and Provincial & Foreign Register] (1884)- The Post Office London Trades' Directory for 1891 (1891)17:Tc87,The aim of the project was to improve access to local and trade directories for the period 1750-1919 by making a substantial collection of English and Welsh directories available online as a Digital Library of Historical Directories.
This digital resource comprises in total some 600 directories, covering every English county together with Wales, and ranging widely over the period 1750-1919 (the latter cut-off point chosen for copyright reasons).  There is a particular focus on the 1850s, 1890s and 1910s, with at least one directory provided for each county in each of these decades.
The digitisation of the volumes involved a two-stage process, in which (1) the hard-copy source was scanned to produce a graphic image of each page, and then (2) those images were processed using OCR software to generate a machine-readable text file.An online version of this resource can be found on the Website of the University of Leicester.
