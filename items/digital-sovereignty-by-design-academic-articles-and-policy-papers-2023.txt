We present five datasets. One dataset contained academic articles data on digital sovereignty, and four other datasets collected policy documents from EU institutions.
The academic articles' datasets contain complete bibliographic information, abstract and keywords (if available) from 2013 to 2023 with a total N of 156 texts. The datasets for the policy documents include the document's title and its complete text: European Commission from 2009 to 2023 with a total N of 2019 texts (61 from Register; 158 from Commonly used documents); European Parliament from 2011 to 2023 with total N of 368 texts; and Council of the European Union from 2001 to 2023 with total N of 221 texts.The ‘Digital Sovereignty by Design’ project will 1) engage with current law and policy approaches to cybersecurity in the United Kingdom and in the European Union, 2) identify how the EU’s current shift towards a digital sovereignty approach may negatively impact upon UK private-sector technology providers, in particular microprocessors, and 3) consider ways in which these negative impacts may be mitigated. Thus, this project addresses how interaction and competition between stakeholders influence the establishment of regulatory regimes over new technological innovations, or categories of technology, related to digital security and data privacy.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Digital Sovereignty by Design, Academic Articles and Policy Papers, 2023"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Digital Sovereignty by Design, Academic Articles and Policy Papers, 2023"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/digital-sovereignty-by-design-academic-articles-and-policy-papers-2023"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Digital Sovereignty by Design, Academic Articles and Policy Papers, 2023"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Digital Sovereignty by Design, Academic Articles and Policy Papers, 2023"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
