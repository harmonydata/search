This dataset explores whether punishments of counter-normative position-taking are conditional on the degree to which the far right is normalized or stigmatized in the party system. It includes responses to a survey related to the Vox party in Spain. The dataset includes indicators capturing reactions to extreme statements made by the party relating to both the Francoist dictatorship as well as LGBTQ issues under situations where Vox is framed as ‘’normal’’ or ‘’stigmatized’’ in the party system. It also includes data that more generally captures party preferences and other political attitudes. Results from these data have been used in a working paper written by the dataset creators: ‘Discounting extreme positions: Normalization and support for the far right,’ which argues that the normalization of a party can reduce the costs that it faces from its extreme statements.The project is organised around three thematic areas: (i) how trust within and between social groups and towards governance institutions emerges and evolves in contexts of rising inequality; (ii) how trust in unequal societies shapes governance outcomes through two intervening factors - political behaviour and social mobilisation; and (iii) the pathways through which changes in such intervening factors may sometimes result in inclusive governance outcomes, but in the breakdown of governance at other times. Each of these areas will incorporate detailed theoretical and empirical analyses at the subnational level in four countries - Colombia, Mozambique, Pakistan and Spain - affected by rising inequalities and characterised by unstable or strained democratic institutions.

The absence of systematic qualitative, quantitative and behavioural data has hindered progress in understanding the links between inequality, trust and governance in countries outside North America and Western Europe. The project seeks to compile a number of unexplored data sources and collect new data comparatively across these other countries in order to fulfil this critical gap. This data collection will involve: (i) comparative individual-level surveys to understand contemporaneous levels of trust, and attitudes towards formal and non-formal local governing institutions, (ii) behavioural experiments under different inequality and political contexts to better understand the formation of trust under different scenarios, (iii) indepth interviews with key political actors in government, members of social movements and citizen organisations to understand how inequalities affect perceptions of governance and strategies of political mobilisation, and (iv)detailed compilation of archival data that will allow us to better understand how inequalities and attitudes have evolved across time and how different historical junctures may shape the governance outcomes we observe today."/><meta property="og:title" content="Discounting Extreme Positions: Normalization and Support for the Far Right Survey, 2023"/><meta property="og:description" content="When are far right parties punished for their extreme positions?

This dataset explores whether punishments of counter-normative position-taking are conditional on the degree to which the far right is normalized or stigmatized in the party system.

The dataset includes indicators capturing reactions to extreme statements made by the party relating to both the Francoist dictatorship as well as LGBTQ issues under situations where Vox is framed as ‘’normal’’ or ‘’stigmatized’’ in the party system. It also includes data that more generally captures party preferences and other political attitudes. Results from these data have been used in a working paper written by the dataset creators: ‘Discounting extreme positions: Normalization and support for the far right,’ which argues that the normalization of a party can reduce the costs that it faces from its extreme statements.The project is organised around three thematic areas: (i) how trust within and between social groups and towards governance institutions emerges and evolves in contexts of rising inequality; (ii) how trust in unequal societies shapes governance outcomes through two intervening factors - political behaviour and social mobilisation; and (iii) the pathways through which changes in such intervening factors may sometimes result in inclusive governance outcomes, but in the breakdown of governance at other times.
