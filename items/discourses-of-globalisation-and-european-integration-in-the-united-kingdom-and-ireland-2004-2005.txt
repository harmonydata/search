The postal survey was backed by detailed discourse analysis of policy documents and a small number of semi-structured interviews with senior policy-makers from both countries (only the postal survey responses are included in the dataset).


 Topics covered in the questionnaire include: attitudes towards globalisation and its political, social, cultural and economic dynamics, the advantages and disadvantages of European integration, and European Monetary Union (EMU). Demographic details were also gathered.

It should be noted that the responses of UK civil servants to questions 8, 9, 10 and 27 on the questionnaire have not been included in the dataset.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Discourses of Globalisation and European Integration in the United Kingdom and Ireland, 2004-2005"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Discourses of Globalisation and European Integration in the United Kingdom and Ireland, 2004-2005"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/discourses-of-globalisation-and-european-integration-in-the-united-kingdom-and-ireland-2004-2005"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Discourses of Globalisation and European Integration in the United Kingdom and Ireland, 2004-2005"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Discourses of Globalisation and European Integration in the United Kingdom and Ireland, 2004-2005"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
