The posts were searched for their relevance to the Elephant and Castle mall in London, a hub from the Latin American community, and the effect of the closing of the hub on the wellbeing of the residences who posted about it. The study was to uncover wellbeing issues that effected displaced populations. The posts and videos were assessed and keywords systematically picked out for snowball analysis, regularity and presence within certain groups. This aided the identification of those factors most relevant to the wellbeing of these migrant groups. The dataset breaks down the number of mentions in individual posts (rather than the total mentions, where some posts may mention the same wellbeing factor more than once). It separates the wellbeing factors (lefthand column) against national groupings identified by the name of the individual Facebook group where the content of those posts originated.This research directly addresses the &#x27;Sustainability, equity, wellbeing and cultural connections&#x27; aspects identified in the call. It investigates through what processes forcibly displaced people become part of cities, in ways that sustainably contribute to economic development, cultural advancement and wellbeing. To this end, we will build a detailed understanding of the relations between placemaking processes, modalities of reception and wellbeing outcomes for displaced groups in Indian and European cities. We do this in a context of rapidly growing human displacement, forced migration and refugee flows to cities globally, and in European and Indian cities that are witnessing rising inequalities.

The research objectives, in approximate order of importance, are:
 
(i) Gain a deep understanding of the material and cultural production, design and architectural organisation of urban spaces of displacement and placemaking processes. 
(ii) Critically examine the ways in which these spaces and the displaced people in them are governed, through assemblages of actors and particular modalities of reception, to produce particular wellbeing effects. 
(iii) Assess in what ways and why displaced people negotiate access to these spaces. 
(iv) Develop, design and build strategic interventions that foster equity and inclusion in urban spaces, grounded in the wellbeing priorities of vulnerable displaced groups. 
(v) Build student and academic capacity for current and future cross- and trans-disciplinary research, design and learning relating to migration management in cities.

To achieve these objectives, the study is guided by an overarching research question: How to curate processes that foster displaced people to become part of the city, and to sustainably contribute to its economic development, socio-cultural cohesion and wellbeing? This question is broken down into four sub-questions: 

1. Through what kinds of placemaking processes in physical and digital spaces do displaced people inhabit, build, make, give meaning and derive wellbeing?
2. In what ways and why do modalities of reception structure economic participation, socio-cultural cohesion and wellbeing outcomes for displaced people? 
3. What is the role of urban informality, temporality and scale in placemaking processes and in the visions and functioning of modalities of reception?
4. What strategic architectural and policy interventions can advance equity and wellbeing for displaced communities in urban spaces?
These questions, along with the wellbeing framework and the highly interdisciplinary methods that the study proposes, ensure that it addresses cross-cutting issues and themes highlighted by the study call, including urban inequalities, the (formal and informal) urban governance features, and practices that interact with vulnerable groups as they are engaged in placemaking processes to critically shape equity and wellbeing outcomes. 

The project will convene European and Indian social science and humanities research communities to jointly conduct cross-country investigations into urban protracted displacement across lower-middle income (India) and higher income countries (Finland, Norway, UK). The comparative case study analysis across cities of various scales (from town to megacity) will advance new empirical, conceptual and theoretical insights. 

This project also offers a unique approach to analysis and capacity building, making sure that the insights and skills gained amongst the consortium will last beyond the end of the project."/><meta property="og:title" content="Displacement, Placemaking and Wellbeing in the City - Facebook Analysed Data of London&#x27;s Latin American Communities During Periods of Displacement and the Effects on Their Wellbeing, 2021-2022"/><meta property="og:description" content="This dataset is gleaned from employing a netnography methodology whereby Facebook posts and media content from London Latin American focused Facebook groups from 2021 backwards were extracted and analysed using Nvivo software.

backwards were extracted and analysed using Nvivo software. The posts were searched for their relevance to the Elephant and Castle mall in London, a hub from the Latin American community, and the effect of the closing of the hub on the wellbeing of the residences who posted about it. The study was to uncover wellbeing issues that effected displaced populations. The posts and videos were assessed and keywords systematically picked out for snowball analysis, regularity and presence within certain groups. This aided the identification of those factors most relevant to the wellbeing of these migrant groups. The dataset breaks down the number of mentions in individual posts (rather than the total mentions, where some posts may mention the same wellbeing factor more than once). It separates the wellbeing factors (lefthand column) against national groupings identified by the name of the individual Facebook group where the content of those posts originated.This research directly addresses the 'Sustainability, equity, wellbeing and cultural connections' aspects identified in the call. It investigates through what processes forcibly displaced people become part of cities, in ways that sustainably contribute to economic development, cultural advancement and wellbeing. To this end, we will build a detailed understanding of the relations between placemaking processes, modalities of reception and wellbeing outcomes for displaced groups in Indian and European cities. We do this in a context of rapidly growing human displacement, forced migration and refugee flows to cities globally, and in European and Indian cities that are witnessing rising inequalities.\\n\\nThe research objectives, in approximate order of importance, are:\\n \\n(i) Gain a deep understanding of the material and cultural production, design and architectural organisation of urban spaces of displacement and placemaking processes. \\n(ii) Critically examine the ways in which these spaces and the displaced people in them are governed, through assemblages of actors and particular modalities of reception, to produce particular wellbeing effects. \\n(iii) Assess in what ways and why displaced people negotiate access to these spaces. \\n(iv) Develop, design and build strategic interventions that foster equity and inclusion in urban spaces, grounded in the wellbeing priorities of vulnerable displaced groups. \\n(v) Build student and academic capacity for current and future cross- and trans-disciplinary research, design and learning relating to migration management in cities.\\n\\nTo achieve these objectives, the study is guided by an overarching research question: How to curate processes that foster displaced people to become part of the city, and to sustainably contribute to its economic development, socio-cultural cohesion and wellbeing? This question is broken down into four sub-questions: \\n\\n1. Through what kinds of placemaking processes in physical and digital spaces do displaced people inhabit, build, make, give meaning and derive wellbeing?\\n2. In what ways and why do modalities of reception structure economic participation, socio-cultural cohesion and wellbeing outcomes for displaced people? \\n3.

What strategic architectural and policy interventions can advance equity and wellbeing for displaced communities in urban spaces?\\nThese questions, along with the wellbeing framework and the highly interdisciplinary methods that the study proposes, ensure that it addresses cross-cutting issues and themes highlighted by the study call, including urban inequalities, the (formal and informal) urban governance features, and practices that interact with vulnerable groups as they are engaged in placemaking processes to critically shape equity and wellbeing outcomes. \\n\\nThe project will convene European and Indian social science and humanities research communities to jointly conduct cross-country investigations into urban protracted displacement across lower-middle income (India) and higher income countries (Finland, Norway, UK).
