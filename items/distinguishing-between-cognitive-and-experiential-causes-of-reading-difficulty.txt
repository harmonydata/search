For example, a deficit in processing visual information, auditory information or speech sounds could each result in difficulties in translating written text into speech sounds, and therefore reading problems.

We will use a comprehensive approach to measure the relative influences of different cognitive deficits, and a successful reading intervention to distinguish between experiential and cognitive causes of reading difficulties.
