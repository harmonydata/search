The focus of this project is on doing precisely that, thus developing capacity and good practice in the analysis of large scale cross-national data sets. This will be accomplished by convening a series of workshops at national and international conferences and publishing and disseminating materials from them.

The workshops will focus on one of the most important substantive issues in comparative cross-national electoral research: the interactions between political institutions, electoral competition, and political attitudes and behaviour as it illustrates many of the problematic issues of this type of research.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"District level electoral data for the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, modules 2 and 3, 2001-2011"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"District level electoral data for the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, modules 2 and 3, 2001-2011"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/district-level-electoral-data-for-the-comparative-study-of-electoral-systems-modules-2-and-3-2001-2011"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"District level electoral data for the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, modules 2 and 3, 2001-2011"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"District level electoral data for the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, modules 2 and 3, 2001-2011"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
