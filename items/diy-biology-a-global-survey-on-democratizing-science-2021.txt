Some items mirrored Grushkin et al.’s (2013) survey for comparison, while others focused on DIY biology’s engagement with industry and academia. The questionnaire combined multiple-choice, short text responses, and time-allocation questions, ensuring a comprehensive dataset.\nThe survey was distributed via social media, mailing lists, and community networks, garnering 154 responses. Of these, 124 participants completed the entire survey, while 30 answered at least two questions.

Instead, it offers valuable insights into trends, challenges, and the professionalization of DIY biology.\nTo encourage participation, respondents could enter a raffle for research vouchers. The median completion time was 20 minutes. Participants provided detailed free-text responses, which added depth to the findings.

(2013) and aims to: (1) assess how the movement has developed over the past decade, (2) examine its relationship with traditional scientific institutions, and (3) provide updated data for DIY biologists and policymakers.
Conducted between March and November 2021, the survey included 28 questions across four key areas: demographics, professional affiliations, DIY biology activities, and perspectives on openness and safety. Some items mirrored Grushkin et al.’s (2013) survey for comparison, while others focused on DIY biology’s engagement with industry and academia. The questionnaire combined multiple-choice, short text responses, and time-allocation questions, ensuring a comprehensive dataset.
The survey was distributed via social media, mailing lists, and community networks, garnering 154 responses. Of these, 124 participants completed the entire survey, while 30 answered at least two questions. The global DIY biology community is estimated to include thousands of individuals, but this study does not claim to represent the full diversity of the movement. Instead, it offers valuable insights into trends, challenges, and the professionalization of DIY biology.
To encourage participation, respondents could enter a raffle for research vouchers. The median completion time was 20 minutes. Participants provided detailed free-text responses, which added depth to the findings. Preliminary results were shared with the community at the Global Community Summit 2021, reflecting the study’s commitment to open knowledge-sharing.
This dataset serves as a resource for researchers, policymakers, and DIY biologists seeking to understand the movement’s trajectory and its intersections with mainstream science.This research project explores the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) biology movement, where biologists and enthusiasts set up laboratories in non-traditional spaces such as kitchens, garages, and community labs. DIY biologists engage in scientific experiments outside institutional settings, working with gene-editing technologies like CRISPR, engineering microorganisms, and developing bio-based projects. By studying this movement, the research aims to understand how extra-institutional science emerges, operates, and interacts with established scientific and regulatory frameworks. Specifically, it examines how DIY biologists create and sustain research spaces and how governments and institutions perceive and regulate these activities.  

This document presents data from the 2021 DIY Biology Community Survey, designed to capture insights into the evolving DIY biology landscape. The survey provides updated perspectives on the movement’s professionalization, relationship with traditional scientific institutions, and engagement with industry. Conducted between March and November 2021, the survey included 28 questions covering demographics, participants’ experiences in academia and industry, their DIY biology activities, and their views on openness and safety in the field. A total of 154 individuals participated, with 124 completing the entire survey. The findings offer valuable perspectives on the state of the DIY biology community, highlighting its diversity, challenges, and evolving role in the broader scientific ecosystem.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"DIY Biology: A Global Survey on Democratizing Science, 2021"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"DIY Biology: A Global Survey on Democratizing Science, 2021"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/diy-biology-a-global-survey-on-democratizing-science-2021"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"DIY Biology: A Global Survey on Democratizing Science, 2021"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"DIY Biology: A Global Survey on Democratizing Science, 2021"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
