A big change since Malinowski’s days is that many of these detailed accounts are now kept by the participants themselves as publicly available records. Such records provide a means for developing micro-level statistical analysis of money flows within the DME that are founded in models of significant monetary transactions as developed by the informants.

Researchers will make detailed observations of selected non-market transactions noting the relationship between the transactors, the quantity and quality of the objects transacted, and the indigenous interpretation of the transaction.
