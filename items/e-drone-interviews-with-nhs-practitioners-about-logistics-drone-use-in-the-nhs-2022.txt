The E-Drone project investigated the potential for drones to be integrated into logistics systems. It used NHS case studies to understand the energy saving potential and the practical and regulatory implications of transporting time-sensitive medical items by drone. The interviews sought to develop an understanding of existing NHS transport practices associated with the movement of time-sensitive medical products (e.g., diagnostic samples, blood, medicines) alongside an initial exploration of the role of drones with practitioners.   Pre-defined questions were identified with respect to the practitioner’s role and the evolving needs of the project with flexibility to further adapt in response to the developing discussion. \n23 interviews were undertaken between June 2021 and December 2022 (one NHS Trust requested that data was not shared, therefore 20 transcripts deposited here). Participants whose role related to the supply or processing of time sensitive medical items were initially identified through local collaborators within the NHS Trusts taking part in the study, participants subsequently recommended further relevant participants. 19 interviews were undertaken online each lasting between 30 and 60 minutes. Four interviews were undertaken in person as they were combined with site visits.CONTEXT OF THE RESEARCH: Vans are the fastest-growing category of licensed road vehicle in the UK with growing CO2 emissions. Vans performing service functions make up the large proportion of activity and, given the need to reduce energy use and emissions, alternative operating practices are being seriously investigated. Our proposed research into how Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and land logistics systems can be combined and managed will provide fundamental new understanding into the impacts of regulation and operating criteria on energy efficiency. UAVs are increasingly seen as a new mode to assist in last-mile logistics. Medical logistics could be the first domain to utilise UAVs on a commercial scale, with preliminary analysis on pathology logistics within Southampton indicating that UAVs would significantly reduce CO2 emissions. With the NHS spending an estimated £2.5 billion annually on pathology logistics and with patient numbers rising, there is a need to re-think how logistics costs could be reduced whilst improving bleed-to-diagnosis times for patients and energy demand. \n\nThe UAV global market is estimated to grow from $2 billion in 2016, to nearly $127 billion by 2020. This will have a significant impact on both controlled and uncontrolled airspace. The greatest barrier to UAV adoption into logistics fleets is the current lack of integration of UAVs within civil airspace which requires development of suitable air traffic rules. The true energy savings and overall viability of UAVs in this domain will only be realised when the regulations governing their use and the operational implications have been quantified through simulation.\n\nAIM AND OBJECTIVES: Our research vision is to examine the energy reduction potential of logistics solutions involving UAVs operating alongside sustainable last-mile delivery solutions (cargo cycles and walking porters via micro-consolidation points). This involves understanding UAV operations in airspace shared with manned aircraft. The project focuses on a case study and trials based around NHS pathology sample transportation in the Solent region. Our key research objectives are to:\n1. Investigate the collective transport and energy impacts of current ‘business-as-usual’ NHS pathology logistics across the Solent region;\n2. Develop new simulation tools to quantify the energy consumption of UAVs and land logistics systems resulting from new types of traffic regulation for shared airspace and the operating requirements of UAVs;\n3. Evaluate the impact on air space and energy use of a large scale take-up of UAVs for medical logistics across the Solent region;\n4. Understand stakeholder concerns about UAVs;\n5. Understand the regulatory and governance needs associated with UAV interventions that will lead to energy benefits in logistics.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND BENEFITS: Our research outcomes will be trialled by Meachers Global Logistics and Steve Porter Transport as part of the project and will provide them and other carriers with evidence of the tangible benefits from adopting UAVs into their logistics fleets.

The project focuses on a case study and trials based around NHS pathology sample transportation in the Solent region. Our key research objectives are to:
1. Investigate the collective transport and energy impacts of current ‘business-as-usual’ NHS pathology logistics across the Solent region;
2. Develop new simulation tools to quantify the energy consumption of UAVs and land logistics systems resulting from new types of traffic regulation for shared airspace and the operating requirements of UAVs;
3. Evaluate the impact on air space and energy use of a large scale take-up of UAVs for medical logistics across the Solent region;
4. Understand stakeholder concerns about UAVs;
5. Understand the regulatory and governance needs associated with UAV interventions that will lead to energy benefits in logistics.

POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND BENEFITS: Our research outcomes will be trialled by Meachers Global Logistics and Steve Porter Transport as part of the project and will provide them and other carriers with evidence of the tangible benefits from adopting UAVs into their logistics fleets. The outcomes of the project will provide evidence for UAV regulation and management policies for shared airspace highlighted as a key requirement by the Department for Transport, the Civil Aviation Authority and NATS.18:T128e,A series of interviews were undertaken as part of the E-Drone research project (https://www.e-drone.org/). The E-Drone project investigated the potential for drones to be integrated into logistics systems. It used NHS case studies to understand the energy saving potential and the practical and regulatory implications of transporting time-sensitive medical items by drone. The interviews sought to develop an understanding of existing NHS transport practices associated with the movement of time-sensitive medical products (e.g., diagnostic samples, blood, medicines) alongside an initial exploration of the role of drones with practitioners.   Pre-defined questions were identified with respect to the practitioner’s role and the evolving needs of the project with flexibility to further adapt in response to the developing discussion. 
23 interviews were undertaken between June 2021 and December 2022 (one NHS Trust requested that data was not shared, therefore 20 transcripts deposited here). Participants whose role related to the supply or processing of time sensitive medical items were initially identified through local collaborators within the NHS Trusts taking part in the study, participants subsequently recommended further relevant participants. 19 interviews were undertaken online each lasting between 30 and 60 minutes. Four interviews were undertaken in person as they were combined with site visits.CONTEXT OF THE RESEARCH: Vans are the fastest-growing category of licensed road vehicle in the UK with growing CO2 emissions. Vans performing service functions make up the large proportion of activity and, given the need to reduce energy use and emissions, alternative operating practices are being seriously investigated. Our proposed research into how Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and land logistics systems can be combined and managed will provide fundamental new understanding into the impacts of regulation and operating criteria on energy efficiency. UAVs are increasingly seen as a new mode to assist in last-mile logistics. Medical logistics could be the first domain to utilise UAVs on a commercial scale, with preliminary analysis on pathology logistics within Southampton indicating that UAVs would significantly reduce CO2 emissions. With the NHS spending an estimated £2.5 billion annually on pathology logistics and with patient numbers rising, there is a need to re-think how logistics costs could be reduced whilst improving bleed-to-diagnosis times for patients and energy demand. 

The UAV global market is estimated to grow from $2 billion in 2016, to nearly $127 billion by 2020. This will have a significant impact on both controlled and uncontrolled airspace. The greatest barrier to UAV adoption into logistics fleets is the current lack of integration of UAVs within civil airspace which requires development of suitable air traffic rules. The true energy savings and overall viability of UAVs in this domain will only be realised when the regulations governing their use and the operational implications have been quantified through simulation.
