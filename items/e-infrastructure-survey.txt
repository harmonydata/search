The project will build an e-Infrastructure on the UK National Grid Service (NGS) to provide integrated access to a variety of resources for social science research, including datasets, tools, services and easy-to-use user environments. Specifically, it will:
(1) make available new, powerful, easy-to-use research tools and services which will reduce the effort needed to integrate and re-use datasets, and simplify the way that research is currently carried out; (2) provide a testbed for the development of metadata and service registries, tools for user authorisation and authentication, and user portals and collaborative virtual user environments; (3) lay foundations for an integrated strategy for the future development and support of e-infrastructure and services, and produce a road-map that identifies the human, technical and financial resources required to pursue the strategy;
(4) leverage infrastructure investment being made by UK e-Science core programme and JISC for the benefit of the Social Sciences; (5) promote synergies across NCeSS and other ESRC investments, co-ordinate activities, encourage mutual support and identify areas in which to promote the benefits of common policies and technology standards.27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2b"}]
