The topics focused on: (1) perceived impacts on the quality of research, (2)the use and usability of e-research tools and (3)funding. 
Survey respondents reflected those interested in e-social science, providing some evidence of where early adoption is likely to occur, and the factors relating to support for these initiatives. Early adoption and interest in e-research practices represent a wide range of methodological traditions, but we found that those most interested in e-research tend to be among a cohort of more recent graduates of doctoral programs. This project is part of a portfolio of work being conducted of the National Centre for e-Social Science (NCeSS) to investigate the application of new grid technologies in the social sciences. The project will build an e-Infrastructure on the UK National Grid Service (NGS) to provide integrated access to a variety of resources for social science research, including datasets, tools, services and easy-to-use user environments. Specifically, it will:
(1) make available new, powerful, easy-to-use research tools and services which will reduce the effort needed to integrate and re-use datasets, and simplify the way that research is currently carried out; (2) provide a testbed for the development of metadata and service registries, tools for user authorisation and authentication, and user portals and collaborative virtual user environments; (3) lay foundations for an integrated strategy for the future development and support of e-infrastructure and services, and produce a road-map that identifies the human, technical and financial resources required to pursue the strategy;
(4) leverage infrastructure investment being made by UK e-Science core programme and JISC for the benefit of the Social Sciences; (5) promote synergies across NCeSS and other ESRC investments, co-ordinate activities, encourage mutual support and identify areas in which to promote the benefits of common policies and technology standards.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"e-Infrastructure survey"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"e-Infrastructure survey"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/e-infrastructure-survey"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"e-Infrastructure survey"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"e-Infrastructure survey"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
