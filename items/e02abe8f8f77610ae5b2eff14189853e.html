This project utilised a participatory action and co-creation approach with KP collaborators and delegates who offered detailed feedback on development and delivery of this simulation training experience. 

Across a range of workshops, CCP and KP reviewed relevant literature, unpublished police cases, and subject specific tacit/academic knowledge to create 6 learning outcomes (LO): 
•	(LO1) Develop knowledge around identification and recognition of CSE, 
•	(LO2) Understand how to support GLE-CSE with a TIA, 
•	(LO3) Develop skills around the active investigation of CSE with GLE-CSE,  
•	(LO4) Understand how to prepare and present CSE cases to the Crown Prosecution Service  
•	(LO5) Recognise and respond to secondary trauma in oneself and colleagues 
•	(LO6) Develop skills to engage GLE-CSE.  
Workshops also included simulation planning via the application of tacit/academic knowledge within interactive elements, storyline, diverse character details and backgrounds, script writing, training strategies to engage police, and the sketching of characters. Outputs from the collaborative design were integrated into the creation of a pilot training tool, supporting training materials which included instructions, activities, worksheets, a training pack, and an academic overview of essential concepts.

Training was delivered to 77 investigators and evaluated using a mixed-methods survey with short answer feedback and Likert-style questions. There was a 100% response rate. Participants completed feedback forms before, during and after training where they self-assessed against learning outcomes (LO). 

Participants liked the interactive training tool, case scenario and topics explored and wanted even more immersive content and further elaboration of some key topics. The training enhanced understanding of TIA to investigating CSE cases. 95% of delegates rated the training as ‘highly relevant’ or ‘relevant’ with 99% rating the tool as ‘very helpful’ or ‘helpful’. Improvement across all LOs was evident.This project will undertake a collaborative knowledge exchange between the Centre for Child Protection (CCP) and Kent Police (KP). They will create, apply, and evaluate a pilot training tool to support police officers in applying a trauma informed approach (TIA) to work with girls who have experience of child sexual exploitation (CSE). 
Training simulations are used to enhance the facilitation of learning and are valuable in developing practice wisdom through immersive and more readily retained &#x27;experiences.&#x27; They allow participants a safe setting to practice complex or challenging risk-taking and decision-making experiences - such as decisions made when confronted with CSE of girls, which is a subcategory of Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG). CSE is when a child is taken advantage of by an imbalance of power to coerce, manipulate or deceive them into sexual activity. This often involves an exchange for something the young person wants or needs or it may be for the advantage of the perpetrator. Girls who have a lived experience of CSE require a TIA from professionals. This includes an understanding of how trauma is manifested through the young person&#x27;s beliefs, feelings, and behaviours - to ensure they are not retraumatised and that they feel able to engage with services to disrupt exploitation. There are indications that police are not trained in TIAs and girls who have experienced CSE may experience police as blaming and insensitive. 
The creation of this pilot training tool will be undertaken in 3 separate work packages (WP). The first WP is being funded by the University of Kent&#x27;s Impact Fund. In summary, this package will involve a literature review and professional knowledge exchange between KP and CCP. These undertakings will explore current knowledge and expertise around good practice, what works and challenges to TIA to police-support with girls who have lived experiences of CSE. 
The second WP is the basis of this proposal to the ESRC and involves three key phases.

on our research expertise on using ‘serious game’ technology for more effective training for child protection workers, the Centre for Child Protection (CCP) partnered with Kent Police (KP) to co-create an ESRC funded pilot-simulation training tool embedding a trauma informed approach (TIA) within police responses to girls with lived experience of child sexual exploitation (GLE-CSE), aiding in the disruption of violence against women and girls.  This project utilised a participatory action and co-creation approach with KP collaborators and delegates who offered detailed feedback on development and delivery of this simulation training experience. \n\nAcross a range of workshops, CCP and KP reviewed relevant literature, unpublished police cases, and subject specific tacit/academic knowledge to create 6 learning outcomes (LO): \n•\t(LO1) Develop knowledge around identification and recognition of CSE, \n•\t(LO2) Understand how to support GLE-CSE with a TIA, \n•\t(LO3) Develop skills around the active investigation of CSE with GLE-CSE,  \n•\t(LO4) Understand how to prepare and present CSE cases to the Crown Prosecution Service  \n•\t(LO5) Recognise and respond to secondary trauma in oneself and colleagues \n•\t(LO6) Develop skills to engage GLE-CSE.  \nWorkshops also included simulation planning via the application of tacit/academic knowledge within interactive elements, storyline, diverse character details and backgrounds, script writing, training strategies to engage police, and the sketching of characters. Outputs from the collaborative design were integrated into the creation of a pilot training tool, supporting training materials which included instructions, activities, worksheets, a training pack, and an academic overview of essential concepts.\n\nTraining was delivered to 77 investigators and evaluated using a mixed-methods survey with short answer feedback and Likert-style questions. There was a 100% response rate. Participants completed feedback forms before, during and after training where they self-assessed against learning outcomes (LO). \n\nParticipants liked the interactive training tool, case scenario and topics explored and wanted even more immersive content and further elaboration of some key topics. The training enhanced understanding of TIA to investigating CSE cases. 95% of delegates rated the training as ‘highly relevant’ or ‘relevant’ with 99% rating the tool as ‘very helpful’ or ‘helpful’.

They will create, apply, and evaluate a pilot training tool to support police officers in applying a trauma informed approach (TIA) to work with girls who have experience of child sexual exploitation (CSE). \nTraining simulations are used to enhance the facilitation of learning and are valuable in developing practice wisdom through immersive and more readily retained 'experiences.' They allow participants a safe setting to practice complex or challenging risk-taking and decision-making experiences - such as decisions made when confronted with CSE of girls, which is a subcategory of Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG). CSE is when a child is taken advantage of by an imbalance of power to coerce, manipulate or deceive them into sexual activity. This often involves an exchange for something the young person wants or needs or it may be for the advantage of the perpetrator. Girls who have a lived experience of CSE require a TIA from professionals. This includes an understanding of how trauma is manifested through the young person's beliefs, feelings, and behaviours - to ensure they are not retraumatised and that they feel able to engage with services to disrupt exploitation. There are indications that police are not trained in TIAs and girls who have experienced CSE may experience police as blaming and insensitive. \nThe creation of this pilot training tool will be undertaken in 3 separate work packages (WP). The first WP is being funded by the University of Kent's Impact Fund. In summary, this package will involve a literature review and professional knowledge exchange between KP and CCP.
