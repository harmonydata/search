The research question was &#x27;an examination of the forms of co-location and socio-economic interaction within and between firms in digital content industries&#x27;.

Location factors turned out to not be as straight forward as cost, but related more to industry institutions (ownership and contacting relations, and market structure), and to labour market pooling (to facilitate re-employment of freelancers), and to local knowledge networks of workers outside/across of the firms.
