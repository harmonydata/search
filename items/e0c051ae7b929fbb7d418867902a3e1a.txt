12:T4bc,In 2006, the Office for Disability Issues commissioned a research project to explore the lives of disabled people in Great Britain today.  The study aimed to develop a generalised picture to better understand disabled people’s experiences and opinions.  It also aimed to provide information to aid the monitoring of progress towards the Government’s vision of achieving substantive equality for disabled people by 2025.  The research project interviewed 1,860 disabled people in Britain during July and August 2007 and was unusual because it actively involved disabled people at all stages of the study.  

The scope of the study, including the issues to be included in the research, was guided by disabled people.  The study covered a wide range of issues including home life, social activities, transport, education, employment and finances.  The study also looked at experiences of discrimination.
