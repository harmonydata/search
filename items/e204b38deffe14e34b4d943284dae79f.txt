12:T8f7,This research comprised a quantitative survey of Jobcentre customers, examining their perceptions of the Jobcentre Plus service. The aim of the research was to obtain customers' views and experiences of various aspects of the service provided by both Pathfinder offices and those offices in the second stage of the national roll-out of Jobcentre Plus. A particular focus of the research was to assess whether customers receive and understand the work-focused message (particularly non-Jobseeker customers), and to explore its impact on their actions and attitudes. 

Specific objectives of the research were to examine customers' views and experience of:
the 'First Contact' meeting (including whether a clear understanding of the process and their requirements were imparted);
the 'Financial Assessor' meeting (including content of the discussion and usefulness of the meeting);
the initial mandatory 'Work-Focused Interview' (WFI) (including the suitability of its timing, the extent and nature of the work-focused discussion, the usefulness of the WFI and the impact on customersâ€™ attitudes and understanding of the system);
subsequent contact with Jobcentre Plus, during the months following the customer's initial WFI.
 The research also aimed to assess customers' perceptions of the impact of the Jobcentre Plus process (including whether the service changed their attitudes/confidence towards job search); and
customers' views on the environment of the Jobcentre Plus office.
 Topics covered include: demographic characteristics, economic activity and circumstances surrounding claim, 'First Contact' meeting with the Jobcentre and perceptions of service, decisions made following Jobcentre meetings, the Work-Focused Interview, whether training or education arranged, health issues and help offered, benefits and advice received, and whether respondent had or planned any further contact with their Jobcentre Personal Adviser. 

The structure of the data file is as follows: 1147 variables are taken directly from the questionnaire (all variable names begin with 'q') as well as 22 raw versions of numeric questionnaire variables (all variable names begin with 'r').
There are 47 derived variables (all variable names begin with 'b'), three sample variables and one weighting variable.13:T8f7,This research comprised a quantitative survey of Jobcentre customers, examining their perceptions of the Jobcentre Plus service.
