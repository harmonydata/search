Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of hospital admission, and in older adults has high rates of mortality and complications. CAP is associated with increased long-term mortality and loss of independence for older adults. CAP typically affects older adults with co-morbidities.  Complications such as sepsis, and empyema (infected fluid around the lung) prolong hospital admission, result in additional interventions in hospital and have higher mortality than CAP alone. The causative agents for CAP are often poorly identified in real world clinical practice.  

The treatment of patients with CAP is complex. Key decisions relate to the antibiotics used, the way antibiotics are given (in a tablet or by a drip) and the place of care (home, hospital and in hospital, a normal ward or intensive care).  These data will allow analyses on differing antimicrobial treatments and outcomes, as well as differing pathways of care.
