This data collection comprises anonymised transcripts of both individual and focus group interviews.\n\nThe individual interviews were conducted with 15 'perpetrators' (accused of, implicated in, or convicted of) racial harassment, each of whom was interviewed twice, and in one case three times. Topics covered include biographical details, family background, life experiences and offending behaviour. \n\nFocus group discussions were held with 13 different groups within local communities in North Staffordshire. Respondents were asked about issues to do with their experiences of living locally, their sense of identity, attitudes towards asylum-seekers, and their views on racially-aggravated assaults.\n\nStandard Measures\nAll individual perpetrators were interviewed using Hollway and Jeffersons' 'Free Association Narrative Interview Method' (see Hollway, W. and Jefferson, T.
