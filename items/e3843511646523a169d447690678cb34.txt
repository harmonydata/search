12:T7f3,This project addressed the question of why some people engage in racially-motivated violence, and how their motivations for doing so intersect and/or conflict with publicly-expressed nationalist, racist/anti-racist, and religious sentiments. The research was conducted in North Staffordshire, and drew on documentary evidence, in-depth interviews with perpetrators and other individuals, and focus groups conducted with members of the local community. The research found that industrial decline had led to many people in North Staffordshire feeling a sense of loss, in that a whole way of life had gone, never to return.  Very many white residents saw the presence of migrant and minority ethnic populations as an emblem of the local area's decline, and an uncomfortable reminder of their inability to secure decent lives for themselves and their families.  Some of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people were trying to cope with their feelings of shame, envy and disgust by projecting them  often aggressively, sometimes violently  onto migrant and minority ethnic groups and individuals. This data collection comprises anonymised transcripts of both individual and focus group interviews.

The individual interviews were conducted with 15 'perpetrators' (accused of, implicated in, or convicted of) racial harassment, each of whom was interviewed twice, and in one case three times. Topics covered include biographical details, family background, life experiences and offending behaviour. 

Focus group discussions were held with 13 different groups within local communities in North Staffordshire. Respondents were asked about issues to do with their experiences of living locally, their sense of identity, attitudes towards asylum-seekers, and their views on racially-aggravated assaults.

All individual perpetrators were interviewed using Hollway and Jeffersons' 'Free Association Narrative Interview Method' (see Hollway, W. and Jefferson, T.
