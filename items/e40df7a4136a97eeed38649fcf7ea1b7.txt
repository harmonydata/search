12:T7a0,The main aims of the project were to:
1. Complete and validate the <i>Westminster Historical Database</i> by including all extant poll book records together with selected rate book records for Westminster between 1749 and 1820;
2. Design and execute experiments on the practice of record linkage using historical sources;
3. Document the <i>Westminster Historical Database</i> and prepare a guide to its effective use;
4. Research and publish on voting behaviour and social structure in a pre-reform  mass electorate;
5. Research and publish on the theme of continuity and change in the economy of Westminster between 1749 and 1820.  The right of voting in Westminster constituency lay in adult male rate paying householders, and thousands of them participated in each of the 12 elections between 1749 and 1820. The database contains individual-level data on pre-reform electoral behaviour for the constituency between 1749 and 1820, and consists of 23 two-way tables in standard relational format. Of these, 12 are electronic editions of the surviving Westminster Poll Books for the years between 1749 and 1820, enhanced through the addition of supplementary name and occupational codes. A further 9 tables are versions of selected Westminster Parish Rate Books which compliment the Poll Book tables and which, through record linkage, enable a much fuller representation to be made of Westminster's voters, their social standing and political preferences. The remaining two tables contain coding schema for names and occupations respectively.

Each poll book record contains data on the surname and forename of the voter, his parish and street of residence, his occupation, his vote, and additional name and occupational codes. Each rate book record consists of the surname and forename of the householder, together with the parish, ward and street within which the property lay, its rack rental assessment, and additional name and occupational codes.13:T7a0,The main aims of the project were to:
