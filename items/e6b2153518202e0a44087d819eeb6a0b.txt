12:T6fc,This data has emerged from qualitative semi-structured interviews which obtained the experiences and perspectives of international practitioners who work with autistic men/men with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder who perpetrate domestic abuse in intimate relationships. It aimed to understand how practitioners can provide safe and effective interventions for neurodivergent men and victim-survivors. 

Key findings included concerns regarding the lack of knowledge about neurodivergence, screening and awareness amongst practitioners, workforce development, recruitment and retainment, and the resourcing and sustainability of neurodivergent responsive interventions. It also identified that practitioners had witnessed that neurodivergent men experience barriers to engagement within mainstream programmes developed and delivered by and for neurotypical people, and that more research is needed about the implications of this for victim-survivors and those who work with them within integrated services.This data set emerged as part of an ESRC postdoctoral fellowship, which aimed to understand how domestic violence perpetrator programmes can be more responsive to the needs of autistic and/or men with Attention deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The fellowship aimed to enrich understanding amongst organisations and policy makers about how to identify and support neurodivergent perpetrators of domestic abuse by developing neuroinclusive interventions.
The fellowship aimed to generate new knowledge by carrying out 10 interviews with international experts working with autistic/ADHD male perpetrators and paves the way towards thinking about, learning from, and developing international responses that tackle the violence of neurodivergent male perpetrators of abuse.13:T6fc,This data has emerged from qualitative semi-structured interviews which obtained the experiences and perspectives of international practitioners who work with autistic men/men with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder who perpetrate domestic abuse in intimate relationships.
