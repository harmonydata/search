12:T855,Dataset resulting from a survey and follow-up survey carried out in 2019 and 2021 with users of the Colombian government’s Illicit Crops Replacing Program (Programa Nacional de Sustitución de Cultivos Ilícitos - PNIS), in the municipalities of Tumaco in Nariño and Puerto Asís in Putumayo. Aim of the surveys is to characterize, for households participating in the PNIS programme, their lifestyle, changes in standard of living and income as a result of joining the program and perception of government institutions participating in the program. In 2019 the survey was carried out in both municipalities. The follow-up survey in 2021 was only carried out in Tumaco, with 165 respondents of the 2019 survey also surveyed in 2021.Drugs & (dis)order is a Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) project generating new evidence on how to transform illicit drug economies into peace economies in Afghanistan, Colombia and Myanmar. By 2030, more than 50% of the world’s poor will live in fragile and conflict-affected states. And many of today’s armed conflicts are fuelled by illicit drug economies in borderland regions. Trillions of dollars have been spent on the War on Drugs, but securitised approaches have failed. In fact, they often increase state fragility and adversely affect the health and livelihoods of communities and households. In light of these failures, there’s increasing recognition that drug policies need to be more pro-poor and aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). But the evidence base for this policy reform is patchy, politicised and contested. Drugs & (dis)order is helping to generate pro-poor policy solutions to transform illicit economies into peace economies. To do this we will: (1) Generate a robust evidence base on illicit drug economies and their effects on armed conflict, public health and livelihoods. (2) Identify new approaches and policy solutions to build more inclusive development and sustainable livelihoods in drugs affected contexts. (3) Build a global network of researchers and institutions in Afghanistan, Colombia, Myanmar and the UK to continue this work.13:T855,Dataset resulting from a survey and follow-up survey carried out in 2019 and 2021 with users of the Colombian government’s Illicit Crops Replacing Program (Programa Nacional de Sustitución de Cultivos Ilícitos - PNIS), in the municipalities of Tumaco in Nariño and Puerto Asís in Putumayo.
