12:T58c,The main aim of this project was the extension of an early stage database on managerial careers from years three to five of a planned 20-year study, and the preliminary analysis of career issues affecting subjects in the database.
Specific objectives were:
to track managerial careers longitudinally, in order to identify systematic patterns of job change and mobility, selection and de-selection, and new forms of work;
to link management education to subsequent career success by examining the relationship between performance at business school and subsequent on-the-job performance;
to track, and seek patterns of, individual satisfaction with training, work, overall career, and life outside work, in particular work-family and work-health trade-offs.
The dataset contains data collected through annual surveys in 1997 and 1998 (continuing on from previous surveys in 1994, 1995 and 1996), as a result of the building/expansion of the longitudinal database on a panel of MBA graduates.  The data covers demographics, performance, career history*, satsifaction history*, learning orientation, attitudes, and non-work activity history* (items marked * were asked each year). In addition, subjects were asked to provide answers to open-ended questions each year, including the reasons for job change, their most significant sources of satisfaction, and the most significant events in their lives in the past 12 months.13:T58c,The main aim of this project was the extension of an early stage database on managerial careers from years three to five of a planned 20-year study, and the preliminary analysis of career issues affecting subjects in the database.
