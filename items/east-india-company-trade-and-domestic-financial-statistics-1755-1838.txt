In creating this dataset, the aim was thus two-fold: i) to establish for the first time a set of statistics detailing the changing value, volume, and geographical structure of the East India Company’s overseas trade for the period when the Company began to exert imperial control over large parts of the Indian subcontinent; and ii) to generate select statistics relating to the Company’s domestic finances, thereby enabling analysis to be undertaken of a range of Company interactions with Britain’s economy and society. The dataset contains 27 spreadsheets which detail the overseas trade and aspects of the domestic finances of the East India Company between 1755 and 1838.  Export and import spreadsheets contain statistics on the volume and value of the Company's trade in silver and commodities between Britain and Asia, with a breakdown illustrating trade flows to and from Bengal, Madras, Bombay, China, and a number of other places.  The export spreadsheets quantify annual shipments of silver, broad cloth, long ells (serge), stuffs (worsteds), lead, copper, copper coin, iron, tin, and other miscellaneous merchandise; the import spreadsheets detail the annual consignments of textiles, tea, and miscellaneous commodities shipped into London.  The domestic finance spreadsheets contain statistics on the Company's annual income in Britain, together with the annual payments made under the heading of silver, commodities, customs duties, dividends, and bills of exchange.
