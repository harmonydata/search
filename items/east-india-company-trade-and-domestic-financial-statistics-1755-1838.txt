Until now quantitative data derived from original sources has only been available in time series for the Company’s trade and some aspects of its domestic finances for the years before 1760.  But many of the details, patterns, and trends of trade and finance in the decades after 1760, a most important period when the Company fully embarked on the interlinked processes of military, political, and commercial expansion in Asia, have remained unclear.  In creating this dataset, the aim was thus two-fold: i) to establish for the first time a set of statistics detailing the changing value, volume, and geographical structure of the East India Company’s overseas trade for the period when the Company began to exert imperial control over large parts of the Indian subcontinent; and ii) to generate select statistics relating to the Company’s domestic finances, thereby enabling analysis to be undertaken of a range of Company interactions with Britain’s economy and society. The dataset contains 27 spreadsheets which detail the overseas trade and aspects of the domestic finances of the East India Company between 1755 and 1838.  Export and import spreadsheets contain statistics on the volume and value of the Company's trade in silver and commodities between Britain and Asia, with a breakdown illustrating trade flows to and from Bengal, Madras, Bombay, China, and a number of other places.  The export spreadsheets quantify annual shipments of silver, broad cloth, long ells (serge), stuffs (worsteds), lead, copper, copper coin, iron, tin, and other miscellaneous merchandise; the import spreadsheets detail the annual consignments of textiles, tea, and miscellaneous commodities shipped into London.  The domestic finance spreadsheets contain statistics on the Company's annual income in Britain, together with the annual payments made under the heading of silver, commodities, customs duties, dividends, and bills of exchange. The monthly price of the Company's capital stock is presented, and details of transfers of stock are given on both a monthly and annual basis.\n\nPlease note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research.","url":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/east-india-company-trade-and-domestic-financial-statistics-1755-1838","identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-5690-1"],"keywords":[]}19:Ta27,The dataset was created as part of an ESRC-sponsored study, ‘British economic, social, and cultural interactions with Asia, 1760-1833’.
