Study 1 was a lab-based study that examined whether people serve themselves more food before eating socially relative to before eating alone. Study 2 was a lab study in which we examined whether social facilitation effects on eating would be sustained across multiple meals and days. Study 3 comprised a lab-based and food diary study to examine whether participants would compensate for increased intake during social meals by eating fewer calories during subsequent meals. Study 4 comprised two online studies in which we aimed to establish the extent to which participants are aware of social context effects on food intake.Much progress has been made recently in identifying aspects of our current eating environment that may promote overconsumption of food and result in a level of obesity that is damaging to health. For example, some evidence suggests that the recent trend towards food products being available in large portion sizes and the omnipresence of tasty food cues in the environment may explain why some people are prone to eating even when they are not in a state of nutritional need. However, a neglected factor in theories of the drivers of obesity is the social context in which eating occurs. While it has been established that eating in a group of friends or family increases consumption at that meal by around 70%, there has been no investigation to date of whether this \"social facilitation\" of eating results in increased cumulative energy intake over time. Moreover, very little is known about why people tend to eat more when eating with others than when eating alone. The studies proposed here will address these important gaps in the literature by conducting the first systematic examination of the mechanisms that underlie social facilitation of eating and assessing whether these effects are compensated for over time. First, we will establish whether the increase in intake that occurs during a meal eaten with others is compensated for by later reducing intake to balance energy intake. Second, we will conduct a series of studies using laboratory based experimental designs and online survey methods to test the novel hypotheses that social facilitation of eating is explained by 1) the effects of social context on fundamental psychobiological aspects of appetite control and 2) the effects of social context on cognitive decision making that takes place before a meal. By adopting a biopsychosocial approach to understand social eating effects, the present programme of research addresses an ESRC priority (ESRC research investment: biosocial research) and comes under the ESRC strategic priority on health and wellbeing. The results will contribute to theory development in appetite research and to the development of policies regarding advice on healthy eating environments. Overall the results of the proposed studies will enhance understanding of the external drivers of overconsumption and provide novel data on how overeating in social contexts may be avoided.","url":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/eating-together-effects-of-the-social-context-of-eating-on-appetite-2018-2021","identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-854464"],"keywords":["SOCIAL INFLUENCE","EATING HABITS"],"temporalCoverage":"2018-03-05/2021-09-30"}15:Tcaa,This archive contains the data files for a series of experiments that were conducted to advance our understanding of the mechanisms involved in social facilitation of eating, and the longer-term effects of social eating on energy intake.
