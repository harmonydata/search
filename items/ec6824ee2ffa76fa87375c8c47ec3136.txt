12:T770,The study will use a mixed methodology approach employing both formal and informal Network Analysis. This will involve conducting survey questionnaires and in-depth interviews with policy makers, industry regulators, trade representatives and members of leading City firms. It also seeks to engage a wide international audience, encourage the sharing of different perspectives, and facilitate lively discussion and debate about the future of the City of London. This is to be achieved through an ambitious programme of interdisciplinary networking and collaboration, international conference presentations and publications, high-profile practitioner workshops, as well as policy briefings and media commentary. 
The two-year project will form the basis for future international collaboration with researchers in New York and Hong Kong which will explore the role of international financial centres in shaping regulatory reform agendas around the world.

Data collection includes quantitative ego-network data on financial industry lobbying around the UK banking reform process in 2010-11; and qualitative interview data on industry lobbying on EU and international regulations on capital requirements from 2010-12.The study set out to map and explain how the City of London engages in the policy process at the national, European and international level. It did so by undertaking a comparative analysis of the policy networks that exist around recent regulatory reforms: the UK Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill; the EU Capital Requirements Directive IV and Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive; and the international Basel III Accord.
