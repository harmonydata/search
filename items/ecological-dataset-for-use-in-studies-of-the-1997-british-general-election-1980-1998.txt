Many researchers interested in voting behaviour in Britain want to study individuals in their ecological (or geographical) contexts, but find this difficult because of problems in assembling relevant datasets.  Most are constrained to studies at one particular spatial scale only and restricted to a relatively small number of census data variables.  Ecological analysis is thus under-developed in British electoral study.
To counter this, and to provide a much better resource base for studies of the 1997 General Election the project aimed to assemble a more comprehensive dataset to facilitate a wide range of ecological analysis and through linkage to the British Election Study allow individual voter's behaviour to be studied in geographical context.  The data comprise 15 files:

1. GE92-97 (con): 1997 general election results and estimated 1992 general election results for the 1997 parliamentary constituencies in Britain.
