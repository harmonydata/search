The UK Government has promised a transformation to a high-wage economy following Brexit, predicated on the view that reduced labour supply will stimulate investment and innovation to raise productivity, and that the UK has become locked-in to a low-cost economic model dependent on cheap international labour. The research will produce new datasets as the latest evidence becomes available, including the 2021 Census of Population, analysis and insights to assess this claim and its geography, by examining links between local changes to local labour demand, supply, wages, productivity and unemployment.

More generally, the research will better understand the impact of Brexit and the pandemic on local labour markets and local economies in different parts of the UK, to inform planning for future economic resilience to 'shocks', and to assess the effectiveness of the UK new immigration policy in meeting labour demand and skills shortages in all parts of the UK.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Economic Inactivity, Health Conditions, Work-Limiting Health Conditions and EU and Non-EU Populations in NUTS3 Regions of the UK, 2018-2021"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Economic Inactivity, Health Conditions, Work-Limiting Health Conditions and EU and Non-EU Populations in NUTS3 Regions of the UK, 2018-2021"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/economic-inactivity-health-conditions-work-limiting-health-conditions-and-eu-and-non-eu-populations-in-nuts3-regions-of-the-uk-2018-2021"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Economic Inactivity, Health Conditions, Work-Limiting Health Conditions and EU and Non-EU Populations in NUTS3 Regions of the UK, 2018-2021"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Economic Inactivity, Health Conditions, Work-Limiting Health Conditions and EU and Non-EU Populations in NUTS3 Regions of the UK, 2018-2021"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
