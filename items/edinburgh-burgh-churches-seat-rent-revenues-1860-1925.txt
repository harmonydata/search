A tariff of prices for different seats within each church was published annually, and payments made by individual heads of household to the local governing body of each church, the kirk session.  Kirk sessions then remitted seat rent income to the Town Council or, post 1860, the Edinburgh Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Seat prices varied by church and position within the building, with those enjoying good sight lines, or proximity to sources of heat, in the most fashionable churches generally commanding a premium. Every church was obliged to provide a small number of free seats for use of the poor.  The practice of renting seats continued in some Burgh churches up to the middle of the twentieth century.

The dataset covers the period 1860 to 1925 and comprises a transcript of seat rent income, church by church, from the annual accounts of the Edinburgh Ecclesiastical Commissioners, a body corporate established in 1860 under the Annuity Tax in Edinburgh and Montrose Act 1860 c.50.  Its responsibilities were amended under the Annuity Tax Abolition (Edinburgh and Monstrose. &c.) Act (1860) 1870 c. 87, and finally transferred to the General Trustees of the Church of Scotland by the Church of Scotland (Property and Endowments) Act 1925, c 33.26:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2a"}]
