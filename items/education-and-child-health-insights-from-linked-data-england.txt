These well-established datasets are a valuable tool for longitudinal research as they contain pseudonymised IDs that allow de-identified records for the same individual to be linked over time. However, because NPD and HES use different IDs, it has not previously been possible for researchers to easily link the information they contain. The ECHILD Research Database includes a linkage file that bridges the gap between these datasets based on a deterministic linkage algorithm.

The ECHILD Database is pseudonymised. It does not include any information that could be used to identify a person, such as names, addresses, postcodes, dates of birth, Unique Pupil Numbers or NHS numbers.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Education and Child Health Insights from Linked Data - England"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Education and Child Health Insights from Linked Data - England"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/education-and-child-health-insights-from-linked-data-england"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://client-logo.metadata.works/ONS-symbol_digital.svg"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Education and Child Health Insights from Linked Data - England"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Education and Child Health Insights from Linked Data - England"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://client-logo.metadata.works/ONS-symbol_digital.svg"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
