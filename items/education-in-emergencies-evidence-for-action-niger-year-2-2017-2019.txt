The 3EA initiative (Education in Emergencies: Evidence for Action) leveraged research-practice partnership between Global TIES for Children at New York University (NYU-TIES) and International Rescue Committee (IRC) and aimed to build both scientific and practical knowledge about how to lift these constraints on children in three CACs: Lebanon, Niger, and Sierra Leone. The present dataset is part of the 3EA initiative and contains data from a large cluster-randomized controlled trial (CRCT) conducted in 2017-2018 school year, evaluating the impacts of a social-emotional learning program (Brain Games) embedded within an after-school remedial education programming on studentsâ€™ academic and social-emotional outcomes. This dataset includes the data collected from Nigerien local and Nigerian refugee children attending the 28 public schools located in Diffa region, Niger.Children in conflict-affected countries (CACs) experience profound constraints on their academic learning and socioemotional well-being. Children exposed to violence and poverty come to \"school\" (formal or non-formal education settings) with poor executive function skills (e.g. working memory, inhibition, attention), emotional/behavioral regulation skills and social-information-processing skills. And the formal and non-formal \"schools\" they attend rarely use effective strategies to advance their academic and socioemotional skills.\nWhat can be done? This project aims to develop both scientific and practical knowledge about how to lift these constraints on children in CACs like Niger. First, we propose to adapt and test novel, low-cost, targeted interventions (LCTs) like Mindfulness (MI) and Brain Games (BG) designed to improve children's executive function, emotional/behavioral regulation and social information-processing skills and, subsequently, their literacy and numeracy skills and socioemotional well-being.\nSecond, even when interventions like MI and BG work, they often work better for some children, in some classrooms and schools, and under some conditions than for others. So this study will examine whether variability in the quality of implementation (e.g. dosage, fidelity) of MI and BG results in the variability in their impacts on children's learning and development in Niger.\nThird and finally, these types of complex interactions among students, teachers, \"schools\" and program interventions (like remedial support programs) are embedded in larger systems and broader contexts that may constrain or enable quality implementation of program strategies (such as MI and BG). But there is very little high-quality, rigorous research, grounded in social and systems theories, available in CACs to understand how these higher-level systems influence the dynamic interactions of schools, programs, classrooms, teachers and students. So we will conduct a theory-building qualitative study embedded in the school cluster-randomized field test of MI and BG and their implementation. Through this project, we hope to (a) achieve a dynamic, multi-level understanding of efforts to improve learning processes and outcomes for refugee, IDP, and local children in Niger and other CACs; (b) contribute to the synthesis of the developmental, educational, prevention and social sciences in theory and method; and (c) have a catalytic effect on the education in emergencies sector by identifying effective, scalable strategies that improve children's learning and development.","url":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/education-in-emergencies-evidence-for-action-niger-year-2-2017-2019","identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-854332"],"keywords":["EDUCATION","LEARNING","EMOTIONS","REFUGEES","EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT"],"temporalCoverage":"2017-07-01/2019-12-31"}15:Te13,Children in crisis-affected countries (CACs) experience profound constraints on their academic learning and socioemotional well-being.

But there is very little high-quality, rigorous research, grounded in social and systems theories, available in CACs to understand how these higher-level systems influence the dynamic interactions of schools, programs, classrooms, teachers and students. So we will conduct a theory-building qualitative study embedded in the school cluster-randomized field test of MI and BG and their implementation. Through this project, we hope to (a) achieve a dynamic, multi-level understanding of efforts to improve learning processes and outcomes for refugee, IDP, and local children in Niger and other CACs; (b) contribute to the synthesis of the developmental, educational, prevention and social sciences in theory and method; and (c) have a catalytic effect on the education in emergencies sector by identifying effective, scalable strategies that improve children's learning and development.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Education in Emergencies: Evidence for Action: Niger Year 2, 2017-2019"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Education in Emergencies: Evidence for Action: Niger Year 2, 2017-2019"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/education-in-emergencies-evidence-for-action-niger-year-2-2017-2019"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Education in Emergencies: Evidence for Action: Niger Year 2, 2017-2019"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Education in Emergencies: Evidence for Action: Niger Year 2, 2017-2019"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
