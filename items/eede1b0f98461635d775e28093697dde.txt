12:T90c,The data consist of scores from core naming, semantic and phonological tasks for 102 children with typically developing language aged four to eight years, and 24 children with word finding difficulties aged six to eight years. All children named a set of 72 pictures. Accuracy and naming time data are reported and incorrect responses are categorised according to type of error made. A word-picture verification task using the pictures from the naming task was administered to assess children's knowledge of the concepts in the pictures and accuracy and reaction time data are reported. A test of associative semantics was administered and accuracy and reaction time data are reported. A nonword repetition task was used to provide a measure of phonology and accuracy is reported. Additional scores for each child include those from background tasks of single and choice reaction time, pattern construction and receptive vocabulary. We all experience difficulties in retrieving words occasionally. Children with difficulties learning language (around 7 percent of the population) can experience considerable problems in retrieving words in their vocabulary. This difficulty can influence children's relationships, self-esteem and education. 
The study has three strands: 1) Involves collecting data from children with typically developing language (TDL) and others with word-finding difficulties (WFD). Accuracy and speed of naming, and related skills involving processing word meaning and sounds will be compared for children at different stages of development. 2) Neurocomputational modelling of the processes involved in word retrieval. Constraints within the model can be varied to reflect the patterns shown by children TDL and with WFD. The model will then be used to predict optimal intervention approaches for children with different underlying difficulties. 3) An experimentally controlled intervention in which children with WFD take part in one form of therapy most appropriate to their difficulty and one building on their strengths to determine which approach is more effective.
Results on testing and on wider outcome measures will inform practice. By combining approaches from different disciplines, the research will inform understanding of typical and atypical language development and intervention.13:T90c,The data consist of scores from core naming, semantic and phonological tasks for 102 children with typically developing language aged four to eight years, and 24 children with word finding difficulties aged six to eight years.
