12:T8ca,The Living in Wales (LIW) survey series, which ran from 2004-2008, was the main general source of statistical information about households and the condition of homes in Wales.  The LIW survey was also referred to as the Welsh Household and Dwelling Survey and replaced the former Welsh House Condition Survey (WHCS), which was last conducted in 1997 and 1998, when a Household Survey was completed in 1997 and a Property Survey in 1998.

The LIW survey had two separate but linked components: the Household Survey and the Property Survey.  The Household Survey was completed annually from 2004 and was conducted as a face-to-face interview with the household reference person (HRP) or another appropriate adult. It aimed to provide additional information to complement the Property Survey, but also to provide information about the community, the use of the Welsh language, the health of the members of the household, the values and opinions of the respondent as well as demographic characteristics. The Property Survey was conducted in 2004 and 2008 (held under SNs 7201 and 7202 respectively) and comprised an internal and external assessment of the property which was completed by a qualified surveyor. 

The Living in Wales survey closed in 2008.  From 2009/2010 onwards, it has been replaced by the National Survey for Wales (held at the Archive under GN 33435). Further information can be found on the Welsh Assembly Government Living in Wales web page.
 To enable analysis of the data at lower geographical levels than Wales, data files for a number of years have been combined.  This has only been possible where the same questions have been asked in all the relevant years. 

Before analysing the 2004 and 2005 combined LIW data, users are recommended to download the documentation that accompanies the individual year datasets for 2004 and 2005, from:SN 6129 Living in Wales: Household Survey, 2004SN 6130 Living in Wales: Household Survey, 2005 The 2004-2005 combined data files include the following topics:household composition, ethnicity, employmentdisability and long-term limiting illnesstransportWelsh languageproviding special carequality of lifefire protectioninternet accesshousing historytenure/area featureseconomic statusincome13:T8ca,The Living in Wales (LIW) survey series, which ran from 2004-2008, was the main general source of statistical information about households and the condition of homes in Wales.
