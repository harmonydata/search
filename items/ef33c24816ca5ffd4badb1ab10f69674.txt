12:T4f6,Reverberating Rhythms: Social and Political Identities in Clubland, 2005-2007 is a qualitative data collection which offers an empirical investigation of contemporary practices of social identities and political participation using electronic music dance culture (clubbing, raving, partying) as an example. Leisure-based activities have become important indicators of who we are and our place in society, including how we understand civic and political participation.

The data collection available from the UK Data Archive includes 38 semi-structured interview transcripts, from two case studies (rural free partiers and urban drum and bass clubbers). The data were collected over two phases. The first phase involved 30 individual interviews spread evenly across the two case studies. In phase two the analysis of the phase one data was summarised and brought back to participants in eight interviews. Observations, focus groups and photographs were also analysed but these are not available for secondary analysis.

Further information on the research project is available from the Reverberating Rhythms project web site and the ESRC Award web page.
