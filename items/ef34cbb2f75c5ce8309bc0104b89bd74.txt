12:T617,This dataset contains semi-structured interviews with 18 trans men from eight countries, including the United Kingdom, Portugal, Germany, Canada, Italy, France, the Netherlands, and Spain. Conducted as part of a broader research programme, these interviews delve into the intricate relationships between body image, quality of life, gender congruence, and societal influences.

Despite growing research with trans and gender-diverse populations, trans men remain underrepresented in research. Little is known about how they navigate body image concerns, societal expectations, and the unique challenges of aligning their physical and social identities. This qualitative study builds on a preceding quantitative phase (see OSF) by providing rich, contextualised insights into trans men’s lived realities across diverse cultural contexts.

The interviews explore how trans men experience and perceive body image and its influence on quality of life, spanning physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains. They also shed light on the intersections of gender congruence and societal norms, capturing narratives of resilience and identity affirmation in the face of barriers.

Participants were recruited via Prolific, and their interviews were pseudonymised to ensure confidentiality. This dataset is an invaluable resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers who want to better understand the needs and experiences of trans men. It can potentially inform affirming care practices and inclusive policies prioritising their well-being.13:T617,This dataset contains semi-structured interviews with 18 trans men from eight countries, including the United Kingdom, Portugal, Germany, Canada, Italy, France, the Netherlands, and Spain.
