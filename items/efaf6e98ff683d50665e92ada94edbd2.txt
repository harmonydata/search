12:T1a0c,Experimental data, effects of reading task on eye movement behaviour during reading. The hypotheses for possible interactions between effects of reading goal and word length are more tentative as there is only very limited existing data that addresses this question. Word skipping: Previous studies have not examined effects of reading goal (reading vs. skimming) and word length on the likelihood of skipping words on first-pass. One possibility is that when skimming for gist longer words are targeted, while short words may be much more likely to be skipped. This may result in an interaction, such that the effect of word length on first-pass skipping may be larger during skimming compared to reading for comprehension. Refixation probability:  The current study is also the first to examine effects of reading goal (reading vs. skimming) and word length on refixation probability. One possibility is that refixation probability is especially high for long words read carefully for comprehension, with much lower refixation probabilities for short words. Refixation probability may be low for both short and long words that are skimmed for gist. This may result in an interactive pattern of results for refixation probability. Gaze duration: Strukelj and Niehorster (2018) reported no significant interaction between reading task and word length for first-pass reading time (gaze duration). However the present study employs tight control of other variables and may reveal more subtle effects. Given the tentative hypothesis for an interactive pattern for refixation probability, a similar interaction may also be observed for gaze duration, such that the effect of reading goal may be larger for long compared to short words. This study has a 2 (word length: short vs. long) x 2 (reading goal: skimming vs. reading for comprehension) within-subject and within-item design. Reading goals are manipulated via instructions given, as well as by the frequency and difficulty of comprehension questions. Each participant completes a reading for comprehension block and a skimming block. For the reading block, participants are instructed to read all of the text carefully and they respond to detailed comprehension questions after most of the sentences. For the skimming block, participants are instructed to skim the text quickly to understand the general content of the text, and they respond to easy questions about the general content (gist) after a small proportion of the sentences. There are 96 experimental sentence items in total. A critical word is embedded into each sentence frame. Critical words are either short, 3-4 characters long (M = 3.80; SD = 0.40) or long, 8-9 characters long (M = 8.38; SD = 0.49). Critical words were always preceded by a 5-6 letter long word.Accurate comprehension of text is vital in everyday life, ranging from educational and professional contexts to social and leisure activities. Our reading goals are affected by factors such as time pressures and the quantity of text available to us, such that often we skim rather than read everything carefully. Now that so much textual information is available on our electronic devices, quantities of text and time constraints are likely affecting our reading goals more than ever before. However skim reading is detrimental for comprehension, for example, resulting in failure to identify all words within the text and limiting integration of new information with previous text and existing knowledge. In educational contexts students may fail to grasp and remember key concepts. In professional contexts readers may have limited time to process new information before making key decisions. Misconceptions may ultimately lead to critical errors in real world situations. For example, misdiagnosis or poor treatment plans in medical contexts.

The aim of this project is to reveal much more about how reading goals modulate the mechanisms underlying reading, with implications for how reading goals affect comprehension. Eye-movement recording methods will provide detailed insights into how reading goals modulate what is processed when during reading. Many previous studies have examined the processes underlying relatively careful reading for comprehension, and there are now sophisticated computational models accounting for these processes. The project is very timely because it extends this work, examining how different aspects of the process, and their co-ordination, is modulated by reading goals. The project examines a broad range of different aspects of the reading process including word recognition, processing of text away from central eye fixation and text integration. The research team have strong track records in undertaking both empirical and theoretical work across these research areas (including collaborative projects) and therefore are ideally placed to undertake this work.

A series of detailed studies will be undertaken, examining fundamental research questions to reveal how reading goals can modulate the level and time course of text processing. These studies are especially valuable in providing a baseline for understanding how reading goals modulate basic aspects of the reading process. The research also has key implications for revealing how reading goals modulate the extent and depth of text processing, with vital implications for comprehension. Studies will examine both how words are processed in visually detailed vision (words directly fixated by the eyes) and how words are processed outside of central vision such that the input is visually degraded. Crucially this work will be central to the development of theoretical models, with implications for how reading goals affect component processes, and how they are co-ordinated together.

A further focus of the project is to undertake research with key applied implications. These studies will reveal possible effects of individual differences, as well as providing clearer insights into how text is integrated and linked to existing knowledge. Crucially studies will also focus on how reading goals modulate the acquisition of new information, with implications for learning in a broad range of contexts.

The project will include dissemination of the work to the public and engagement with professional organisations, especially highlighting how reading behaviours can affect comprehension. For example, reading under time pressure may result in omission of words and limited integration with prior knowledge, resulting in misconceptions or limited acquisition of new information. In some contexts (such as medical diagnosis) awareness of the potential for errors could be critical.13:T1a0c,Experimental data, effects of reading task on eye movement behaviour during reading.
