Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) standard PIS only; (2) PIS with a general health-related testimony video; or (3) PIS with a testimony video tailored to mental health. Primary outcomes measure whether participants expressed an intention to join the trial, while secondary outcomes include consent rates, randomisation into the host trial, and dropout rates.

The rationale for using testimony videos stems from prior findings that group identity and altruistic motivation can encourage trial participation. While previous studies incorporating multimedia in recruitment materials showed limited effectiveness, this study uniquely explores tailored, condition-specific testimonies and their potential influence—especially in mental health contexts, where no such embedded studies had previously been conducted.

Key findings, if any, are to be determined through mixed-effects linear regression analysis of recruitment intent and comparative analysis of consent and dropout rates between groups. The dataset therefore holds valuable insights into the effectiveness of multimedia and emotionally resonant storytelling in the trial recruitment process, potentially informing future practices across diverse clinical research settings.This study investigates the effect of patient testimony videos on recruitment rates for clinical trials. The primary aim is to determine whether adding a brief video featuring a participant testimony to the standard participant information sheet (PIS) enhances recruitment rates to a clinical trial. The secondary objective is to explore whether tailoring the video content to the specific health condition being studied offers additional benefits. This Study Within A Trial (SWAT) is embedded within the STOP (Successful Treatment of Paranoia) trial, which investigates interventions for individuals with paranoia. Participants will be randomly allocated into three intervention groups: (1) the usual procedure with a standard PIS, (2) the standard PIS with a general health testimonial video, and (3) the standard PIS with a mental
health-specific testimonial video. The primary outcome will be participants' intention to participate, assessed as a binary 'yes' or 'no' response. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of participants
who consent to the trial, are randomized, and drop out after randomization. This SWAT aims to determine if patient testimonials, particularly when tailored to the health condition in question, can increase engagement and recruitment in clinical trials. The study will analyze the effectiveness of these interventions through multi-level regression models and provide valuable insights into improving trial recruitment strategies.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"The Effect of Patient Testimony Videos on Recruitment to a Clinical Trial, 2021-2024"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"The Effect of Patient Testimony Videos on Recruitment to a Clinical Trial, 2021-2024"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/effect-of-patient-testimony-videos-on-recruitment-to-a-clinical-trial-2021-2024"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"The Effect of Patient Testimony Videos on Recruitment to a Clinical Trial, 2021-2024"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The Effect of Patient Testimony Videos on Recruitment to a Clinical Trial, 2021-2024"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
