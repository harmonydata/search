The study builds on a longitudinal research project into Variations in Teachers’ Work, Lives and their Effects on Pupils (VITAE) (not available from the UKDA) by including new observational components to investigate the classroom practice of teachers drawn from schools where national test and exam results were identified as being typical or better than expected in terms of value-added.

There were two rounds of school-based data collection (autumn 2006 and spring/summer 2007) which included a teacher questionnaire survey, observations of classroom practice, pre- and post-observation interviews with teachers, and repertory grid interviews.  In addition pupil questionnaires were completed in each of the participating teachers’ classes or teaching groups.

The data available from the UKDA are a sample of data collected.  The sample comprises 30 teacher interview transcripts (pre/post observation and round 1 and 2), 10 Repertory grid interview transcripts (round 1 and 2); a sample of data from the teacher interviews and teaching observations, a sample of data from the pupil questionnaires completed by Year 2, 6 and 9 students.  The data cannot be linked.

Teacher data:
Questionnaire survey: used to a) identify key characteristics of teachers in terms of age, years in teaching and school sector; and b) establish, in conjunction with the literature, key factors thought to influence teachers’ classroom practice and student learning and attainmentObservations of classroom practice: using a) fieldnotes to explore factors including classroom relationships, teacher persona, etc; and b) structured observation schedules. The International System for Teacher Observation and Feedback (ISTOF) schedule is based on ratings of teachers’ practice according to the frequency of different observed behaviours. The Quality of Teaching (QoT) schedule is a value based instrument using researcher judgments of the balance of strengths and weaknesses of different features of classroom practiceSemi-structured pre- and post-observation interviews: the pre-observation interview explored issues such as planning, differentiation and inclusion, classroom management, teaching skills, assessment, and role. The post-observation instrument allowed in-depth probing of issues relating to aspects of the observed teaching session as well as exploring perceptions of effectiveness, leadership, identity, and professional life phaseRepertory grid interview: this explored personal constructs related to effective teaching. Interviews were digitally recorded, a proportion of these were transcribed and a content analysis carried out on the process by which the constructs were elicitedPupil data:
Questionnaire survey: used with each of the classes or teaching groups to gather information about pupils’ perceptions of different aspects of their classroom experiences, attitudes towards school and views of teaching."/><meta property="og:title" content="Effective Classroom Practice: a Mixed Method Study of Influences and Outcomes, 2006-2007 / ECP"/><meta property="og:description" content="This mixed methods study sought to identify key factors that contribute to the similarities, dissimilarities and variations in teachers’ management of sustained effective teaching.
