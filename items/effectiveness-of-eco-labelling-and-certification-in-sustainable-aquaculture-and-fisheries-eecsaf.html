In phase 2 survey data were gather from a face to face consumer survey and UK scope, displaying data on individual consumers&#x27; and producers&#x27; views and practices concerning certification and ecolabelling.

Phase 3 used unstructured in-depth interviews to gather data from some senior management of CEOs. 10 interviews were transcribed. In recent years three trends have become apparent with marine resources: an increase in demand for seafood, an emerging crisis in the state of global harvests, and a rapid increase in aquaculture. Statistics highlight the capacity of the oceans to produce wild harvests are nearing a sustainable limit. Within this context, certification and ecolabelling of seafood has become a popular means to inform consumers of the quality of a product.

This research aims to unravel some of the key questions surrounding the ecolabelling process.
