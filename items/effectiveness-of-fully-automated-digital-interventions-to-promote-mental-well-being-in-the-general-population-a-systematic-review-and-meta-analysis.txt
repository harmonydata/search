Specifically, mindfulness, acceptance & commitment, and compassion-based interventions significantly promoted mental well-being in the general population; insufficient evidence was available for positive psychology and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)-based interventions; and contraindications were found for integrative approaches. Overall, there was substantial heterogeneity which could partially be explained by the intervention duration, comparator and study outcome. Risk of bias was high and confidence in quality of the evidence very low (GRADE), primarily due to the high rates of study dropout (averaging 37%, ranging from 0-85%) and suboptimal intervention adherence (averaging 40%).Additional investment in mental health and well-being support is essential. Digital health technology has a great potential to support mental health and well-being and has substantial benefits over face-to-face treatment. Nevertheless, valuable insights into engagement and effectiveness of digital health technology to support mental health and well-being are currently missing. Therefore, this project aims to understand the effectiveness and engagement with digital health technology to support mental health and well-being.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"The Effectiveness of Fully Automated Digital Interventions to Promote Mental Well-being in the General Population: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis, 2022"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"The Effectiveness of Fully Automated Digital Interventions to Promote Mental Well-being in the General Population: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis, 2022"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/effectiveness-of-fully-automated-digital-interventions-to-promote-mental-well-being-in-the-general-population-a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"The Effectiveness of Fully Automated Digital Interventions to Promote Mental Well-being in the General Population: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis, 2022"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The Effectiveness of Fully Automated Digital Interventions to Promote Mental Well-being in the General Population: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis, 2022"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
