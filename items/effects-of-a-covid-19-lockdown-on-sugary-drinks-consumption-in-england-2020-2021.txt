15:T1427,{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Effects of a COVID-19 Lockdown on Sugary Drinks Consumption in England, 2020-2021","description":"We examined the impact of a COVID-19 lockdown in England on the consumption occasions and on the amount of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) consumed. Beverage consumption is strongly associated with specific, often social, consumption situations (e.g., going out). We reasoned that the lockdown would affect consumption behaviour because it removed typical SSB consumption situations. Specifically, we hypothesised that SSB consumption occasions and amount would be reduced during lockdown compared to before and after lockdown, especially in typical SSB drinking situations. In two surveys (Dec. 2020 and May 2021) among the same participants (N = 211, N = 160; consuming SSBs at least once/week) we assessed the frequency of SSB and water consumption occasions before, during, and after the November/December 2020 lockdown, across typical SSB and water drinking situations. This presents a detailed picture of the situations where participants drink SSBs and water, and how this was affected by a lockdown. We also assessed the daily amount of SSBs and water consumed in each period, and perceived habitualness of drinking SSBs and water. As predicted, participants reported fewer occasions of drinking SSBs during lockdown compared to before and after, especially in typical SSB drinking situations. Unexpectedly, however, the daily amount of SSBs consumed increased during lockdown, compared to before and after, especially among participants with stronger perceived habitualness of SSB consumption. Exploratory analyses suggest that during lockdown, participants increased their SSB consump¬¬tion at home. Water consumption, on the other hand, was not systematically affected by the lockdown. These findings suggest even if some typical consumption situations disappear, consumption may be hard to disrupt if the behaviour is rewarding.What is the motivation for consuming sugary drinks? Why do some people choose Coke, and others water, to accompany their dinner or to quench their thirst? We know very little about the psychological processes underlying these behaviours. While the motivation for unhealthy food has been researched extensively, the motivation for sugary drinks remains understudied, despite their negative health implications. Up to 19% of daily calorie intake consists of sugar from drinks, and the consumption of sugary drinks contributes to weight gain. The consumption of sugary drinks is a main contributor to poor dental health and to overweight, which cost the NHS 3.4 billon and 4.7 billion a year in England alone (Public Health England, 2014). Especially given the recent media attention, many consumers are aware of the health implications of sugary drinks, but struggle to successfully reduce their intake. Therefore, it is important to understand what underlies the motivation for sugary drinks, and how we can effectively assist consumers in replacing sugary drinks with healthier alternatives such as water. We propose that sugary drinks gain their attractiveness through consumption and reward simulations. In other words, when people see or think about a sugary drink, they spontaneously simulate (i.e., re-experience) the sensation and the reward of consuming it, such as its taste, the resulting energy boost, and the quenching of thirst, based on their previous, rewarding experiences. These simulations trigger a desire to consume sugary drinks, particularly when feeling thirsty. Although evidence exists for the role of such simulations in the motivation for food, no previous studies have applied this account to drinks. Our research will first systematically test this simulation account of the motivation for sugary drinks, and then use it to stimulate healthier choices in innovative ways. In Subproject 1, we will investigate the specific simulations that are triggered by sugary drinks and by water. Building on recent pilot data that we have collected, we expect that sugary drinks will trigger more consumption and reward simulations than water, particularly among high consumers of sugary drinks, and particularly when thirsty. In Subproject 2, we will link these consumption and reward simulations to the motivation to consume sugary drinks and water. To this end, we will use a novel method to assess motivation unobtrusively: we will measure the degree to which participants slightly lean forward on a Wii balance board when viewing images of drinks. Such subtle approach movements have been shown to reflect motivation and desire. We predict that more consumption and reward simulations will be associated with leaning forward more toward sugary drinks images, especially among high consumers of sugary drinks and especially when thirsty.","url":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/effects-of-a-covid-19-lockdown-on-sugary-drinks-consumption-in-england-2020-2021","identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-856173"],"keywords":["COVID-19","SUGAR","HEALTH","CONSUMERS","DIETARY HABITS"],"temporalCoverage":"2020-12-01/2021-05-31"}17:T125c,We examined the impact of a COVID-19 lockdown in England on the consumption occasions and on the amount of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) consumed.

In two surveys (Dec. 2020 and May 2021) among the same participants (N = 211, N = 160; consuming SSBs at least once/week) we assessed the frequency of SSB and water consumption occasions before, during, and after the November/December 2020 lockdown, across typical SSB and water drinking situations. This presents a detailed picture of the situations where participants drink SSBs and water, and how this was affected by a lockdown. We also assessed the daily amount of SSBs and water consumed in each period, and perceived habitualness of drinking SSBs and water. As predicted, participants reported fewer occasions of drinking SSBs during lockdown compared to before and after, especially in typical SSB drinking situations. Unexpectedly, however, the daily amount of SSBs consumed increased during lockdown, compared to before and after, especially among participants with stronger perceived habitualness of SSB consumption. Exploratory analyses suggest that during lockdown, participants increased their SSB consump¬¬tion at home. Water consumption, on the other hand, was not systematically affected by the lockdown. These findings suggest even if some typical consumption situations disappear, consumption may be hard to disrupt if the behaviour is rewarding.What is the motivation for consuming sugary drinks? Why do some people choose Coke, and others water, to accompany their dinner or to quench their thirst? We know very little about the psychological processes underlying these behaviours. While the motivation for unhealthy food has been researched extensively, the motivation for sugary drinks remains understudied, despite their negative health implications. Up to 19% of daily calorie intake consists of sugar from drinks, and the consumption of sugary drinks contributes to weight gain. The consumption of sugary drinks is a main contributor to poor dental health and to overweight, which cost the NHS 3.4 billon and 4.7 billion a year in England alone (Public Health England, 2014). Especially given the recent media attention, many consumers are aware of the health implications of sugary drinks, but struggle to successfully reduce their intake. Therefore, it is important to understand what underlies the motivation for sugary drinks, and how we can effectively assist consumers in replacing sugary drinks with healthier alternatives such as water. We propose that sugary drinks gain their attractiveness through consumption and reward simulations. In other words, when people see or think about a sugary drink, they spontaneously simulate (i.e., re-experience) the sensation and the reward of consuming it, such as its taste, the resulting energy boost, and the quenching of thirst, based on their previous, rewarding experiences. These simulations trigger a desire to consume sugary drinks, particularly when feeling thirsty. Although evidence exists for the role of such simulations in the motivation for food, no previous studies have applied this account to drinks. Our research will first systematically test this simulation account of the motivation for sugary drinks, and then use it to stimulate healthier choices in innovative ways. In Subproject 1, we will investigate the specific simulations that are triggered by sugary drinks and by water. Building on recent pilot data that we have collected, we expect that sugary drinks will trigger more consumption and reward simulations than water, particularly among high consumers of sugary drinks, and particularly when thirsty. In Subproject 2, we will link these consumption and reward simulations to the motivation to consume sugary drinks and water. To this end, we will use a novel method to assess motivation unobtrusively: we will measure the degree to which participants slightly lean forward on a Wii balance board when viewing images of drinks. Such subtle approach movements have been shown to reflect motivation and desire. We predict that more consumption and reward simulations will be associated with leaning forward more toward sugary drinks images, especially among high consumers of sugary drinks and especially when thirsty.1a:T125c,We examined the impact of a COVID-19 lockdown in England on the consumption occasions and on the amount of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) consumed. Beverage consumption is strongly associated with specific, often social, consumption situations (e.g., going out). We reasoned that the lockdown would affect consumption behaviour because it removed typical SSB consumption situations. Specifically, we hypothesised that SSB consumption occasions and amount would be reduced during lockdown compared to before and after lockdown, especially in typical SSB drinking situations.
