Archive (UBIRA). The data contained in the UBIRA archive contain the data from a set of online, hypothetical scenario-based experiments in which participants responded to a series of Likert-type measures concerning their subsequent perceptions, emotions and behaviours. The experiments concern service recovery scenarios and customers' perceptions of firms' actions to recover from service failures. The details of the measures are provided in the data set. The details of the protocols are provided in the PhD thesis.This research is relevant to customer relationship management and crisis management. It aims to investigate the strategies adopted by firms to effectively manage complaints in face-to-face and online transactions. Prior research has indicated that the service recovery literature can benefit from insights gleaned from the customer revenge, brand transgression and crisis management literatures. However, currently little has been done to integrate the contributions from these different fields in order to provide insight as to how to provide an effective organisational apology after a service failure. Moreover, service recovery researchers have called for further research into customer responses, which have received less attention in traditional service recovery research, such as revenge behaviours. My research proposes a quantitative approach to understanding the interaction between recovery agents and customers in the post-recovery phase. This will include the analysis of real customer revenge behaviour following an ostensibly real service failure in an online shopping experience.
