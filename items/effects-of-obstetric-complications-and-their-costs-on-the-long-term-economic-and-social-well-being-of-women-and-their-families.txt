It will build on a recent study of 1013 women in Burkina Faso which investigated the health, economic and social consequences of obstetric complications and normal births in health facilities up to one year after birth. The study will re-contact the participants at 3 and 4 years after birth, and include an additional group of women from the community who delivered around the same time. Information will be collected on what has happened since the index birth to household income, belongings, debts and consumption, to women’s mental and physical health and social situation, to their ability to earn money, work in production and in the home, the survival and development of the children, and to decisions about future pregnancies.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"The effects of obstetric complications and their costs on the long-term economic and social well being of women and their families"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"The effects of obstetric complications and their costs on the long-term economic and social well being of women and their families"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/effects-of-obstetric-complications-and-their-costs-on-the-long-term-economic-and-social-well-being-of-women-and-their-families"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"The effects of obstetric complications and their costs on the long-term economic and social well being of women and their families"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The effects of obstetric complications and their costs on the long-term economic and social well being of women and their families"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
