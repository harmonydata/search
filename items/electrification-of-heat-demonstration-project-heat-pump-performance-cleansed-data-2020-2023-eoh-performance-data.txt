The EoH project was funded by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. From 2023, it is covered by the new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.
Data availability
This study comprises the open-access cleansed data from the EoH project and a summary dataset, available in four zipped files (see the 'Access Data' tab). Users must download all four zip files to obtain the full set of cleansed data and accompanying documentation.
When unzipped, the full cleansed data comprises 742 CSV files. Most of the individual CSV files are too large to open in Excel. Users should ensure they have sufficient computing facilities to analyse the data.
The UKDS also holds an accompanying study, SN 9049 Electrification of Heat Demonstration Project: Heat Pump Performance Raw Data, 2020-2023, which is available only to registered UKDS users. This contains the raw data from the EoH project. Since the data are very large, only the summary dataset is available to download; an order must be placed for FTP delivery of the remaining raw data. Other studies in the set include SN 9209, which comprises 30-minute interval heat pump performance data, and SN 9210, which includes daily heat pump performance data. 
The Python code used to cleanse the raw data and then perform the analysis is accessible via the

Energy Systems Catapult Github
