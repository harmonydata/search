For further information about the project and Domesday Book please refer to the project web site, where an alternative download possibility for the data is available. The Domesday Book (1086) contains the most comprehensive array of social and economic data for the pre-industrial world from anywhere in Europe, possibly from the planet. It is a major source for the disciplines of archaeology, geography, genealogy, law, linguistics, onomastics, palaeography, philology, prosopography, and topography; for several of these disciplines, it is the major source. The history of majority of towns and villages begins with Domesday Book, which includes a vast amount of data on names, places, individuals, taxation, land use, population groups, estate values, legal matters, and a wide variety of economic and agricultural resources: mills, meadow, woodland, pasture, salt-pans, fisheries, etc. Only a minute amount of such data has survived from the first six centuries of English history and little became available for another two centuries, and even then never as a comprehensive national survey.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Electronic Edition of Domesday Book: Translation, Databases and Scholarly Commentary, 1086; second edition"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Electronic Edition of Domesday Book: Translation, Databases and Scholarly Commentary, 1086; second edition"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/electronic-edition-of-domesday-book-translation-databases-and-scholarly-commentary-1086-second-edition"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Electronic Edition of Domesday Book: Translation, Databases and Scholarly Commentary, 1086; second edition"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Electronic Edition of Domesday Book: Translation, Databases and Scholarly Commentary, 1086; second edition"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
