The dataset comprises transcripts of interviews with engineers, healthcare professionals, carers and patients who are involved in development of smart technologies for care settings. The interviews explored from each participants’ perspective their experience of the opportunities and challenges of smart care, including when and how they become aware of ethical challenges, how they distinguish the ethical challenges from other kinds of issue such as a technical hitch or a misunderstanding, and how they deal with the various kinds of issue to negotiate acceptable outcomes. Interviews also explored with participants their understanding of principles of ethical artificial intelligence (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice and explainability) as applied to smart care. Each interviewee was offered two short follow up interviews. In total the dataset comprises interviews with 14 pairs of service users and carers, 12 researchers and developers and 4 healthcare professionals .

The dataset comprises transcripts of interviews with engineers, healthcare professionals, carers and patients who are involved in development of smart technologies for care settings. The interviews explored from each participants’ perspective their experience of the opportunities and challenges of smart care, including when and how they become aware of ethical challenges, how they distinguish the ethical challenges from other kinds of issue such as a technical hitch or a misunderstanding, and how they deal with the various kinds of issue to negotiate acceptable outcomes. Interviews also explored with participants their understanding of principles of ethical artificial intelligence (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice and explainability) as applied to smart care. Each interviewee was offered two short follow up interviews. In total the dataset comprises interviews with 14 pairs of service users and carers, 12 researchers and developers and 4 healthcare professionals .
