This will be achieved by giving the participants the opportunity to prioritise key events and experiences which they believe are central to the experience of SCI and by allowing them to tell their own stories in their own words. All interviews will be transcribed verbatim and will be analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA)- a distinctive and rigorous qualitative approach which is being increasingly applied to health research. 

This research, therefore, has the potential to generate a rich insight into what it means to live with a SCI, to form a basis for future research, to advance policy, to promote a holistic, person-centred approach to care and to facilitate coping with SCI.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Emotional experience and quality of life following a spinal cord injury: An interpretative phenomenological analysis"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Emotional experience and quality of life following a spinal cord injury: An interpretative phenomenological analysis"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/emotional-experience-and-quality-of-life-following-a-spinal-cord-injury-an-interpretative-phenomenological-analysis"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Emotional experience and quality of life following a spinal cord injury: An interpretative phenomenological analysis"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Emotional experience and quality of life following a spinal cord injury: An interpretative phenomenological analysis"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
