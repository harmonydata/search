To avoid an excessively long questionnaire the merger of the survey involved more extensive modularisation of the questionnaire than used previously. This is discussed in the questionnaire chapter of the Technical Report.As in previous years, the 2019 ESS had two main elements:The core survey: covering such topics as recruitment, skills gaps, training and workforce development, upskilling needs, vocational qualifications, apprenticeships and traineeships.The Investment in Training follow-up survey: covering the investment establishments make in training their staff.The study consists of a) 81,013 telephone interviews with employers at the local establishment level; and b) 10,225 follow-up interviews with employers to capture data on Investment in Training. The study captures detailed and comprehensive information from employers on: their skills needs both from the external labour market and their existing staff; their activities to develop skills among existing employees; and their working practices.Further information, including reports and technical documents, can be found on the gov.uk Employer Skills Survey, 2019 webpage.
