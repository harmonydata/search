Fieldwork was carried out by a survey research organisation, GfK NOP. Of the 302 responses, 258 were from operations of foreign-owned multinationals operating in UK, the remaining 44 from UK-owned multinationals. 

The survey findings have been used to test propositions concerning the association between a company's employment practices and organisational factors, such as corporate structure, international integration of operations, nationality of ownership, and sector.

Further information about the study may be found on the Warwick Business School Employment Practices of Multinational Companies in Organisational Context project web page and the Economic and Social Research Council's (ESRC) Employment Practices of Multinational Companies (MNCs) in Organisational Context: a Large-scale Survey project web page.

The Principal Investigators request that, rather than using the shortened form "Edwards, P. et al.", users list all five authors when citing the study, as follows: "Edwards, P., Edwards, T., Ferner, A., Marginson, P. and Tregaskis, O. Employment Practices of Multinational Companies in Organisational Context, 2005-2006 [computer file]. Colchester, Essex: UK Data Archive [distributor], November 2007. SN: 5748."
 The survey covered the strategy, structure and control mechanisms of companies, and the international structure and role of the human resource management function. It also examined four substantive areas of employment practice: performance management and reward systems; organisational learning; employee involvement and communication; and employee representation.

The survey distinguished practice for three groups among the workforce: managers; the largest occupational group (LOG) among non-managerial employees; and (an innovation in the survey) a key group of employees critical to the firm’s core competence.27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2b"}]
