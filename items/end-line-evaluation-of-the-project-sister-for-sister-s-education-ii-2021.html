The project was implemented by the VSO in Nepal with the British Council as resource partner and Mercy Corp as the technical partner in four districts of Nepal: Dhading, Lamjung, Parsa, and Surkhet. Foundation of Development Management (FDM) conducted a longitudinal evaluation of the project, of which FDM was part of the midline and endline evaluation. Here, the FDM is submitting the quantitative data of the end-line evaluation gathered through the Household and Girls’ Survey. The project stands on three major components: learning, transition, and sustainability. To supplement these outcomes, five intermediate outcomes, namely, attendance, self-esteem and empowerment of the girls, parental engagement in girl’s education, teaching quality and gender-responsive school management and governance, were developed. In addition to these pre-developed components, inquiry on the impact of COVID-19 was carried out among the girls. Data concerning these outcomes, intermediate outcomes and the impact of the pandemic were collected through girls’ and household surveys. Due to the limitation posed by the pandemic, data were collected only from the treatment schools. The dataset of the girls and households survey has been attached herein along with a codebook to ensure  further clarity on the dataset.Sisters for Sisters&#x27; Education II (SfSE-II) project is funded by Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office’s Girls’ Education Challenge Transition Window (GEC T) and builds on the achievements of phase I (2013 – 2017). Through improved access to quality education, SfSE-II envisioned that marginalized adolescent girls from rural Nepal will transition from basic to secondary education, and secondary to upper secondary, empowered to leave school to either secure a sustainable livelihood or continue with education. They will be equipped with skills that improve employability, enhance confidence and self-esteem to act as leaders, and enable them to influence and control their own sexual and reproductive health rights. The project worked in 48 schools across four districts targeting 1720 adolescent girls. Local NGOs Aasaman Nepal was in the SfSE-II consortium and supported implementation across the 4 districts.
Foundation for Development Management (FDM) conducted a longitudinal evaluation of the project. The evaluations were spread across three different phases, namely, baseline, midline, and end-line.

Here, the FDM is submitting the quantitative data of the end-line evaluation gathered through the Household and Girls’ Survey. The project stands on three major components: learning, transition, and sustainability. To supplement these outcomes, five intermediate outcomes, namely, attendance, self-esteem and empowerment of the girls, parental engagement in girl’s education, teaching quality and gender-responsive school management and governance, were developed. In addition to these pre-developed components, inquiry on the impact of COVID-19 was carried out among the girls. Data concerning these outcomes, intermediate outcomes and the impact of the pandemic were collected through girls’ and household surveys.
