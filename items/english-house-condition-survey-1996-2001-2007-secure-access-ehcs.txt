Secure Access EHCS Data:
Secure Access datasets for the EHCS include two detailed geographical variables that are not available in the standard End User Licence (EUL) versions: Postcodes and Lower Layer Super Output Areas. The two variables are available in separate Geographical Information data files, along with the key variable 'aacode', allowing the user to merge with other files of their choice. All other files are the same as in the EUL versions.

Prospective users of the Secure Access version of the EHCS will need to fulfil additional requirements, commencing with the completion of an extra application form to demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the extra, more detailed variables, in order to obtain permission to use that version. Secure Access users must also complete face-to-face training and agree to Secure Access' User Agreement and Licence Compliance Policy (see 'Access' section below). Therefore, users are encouraged to download and inspect the EUL versions of the data prior to ordering the Secure Access version.

 The main topics are: general tenure and demographics; household income and housing costs; housing needs; housing aspirations and satisfaction; housing moves; vulnerable and disadvantaged households.

The EHCS consists of a number of component surveys:

Interview Survey
An interview is first conducted with the householder. The interview topics include: household characteristics, satisfaction with the home and the area, disability and adaptations to the home, work done to the property and income details.

Physical Survey
The interview is followed by a visual inspection of the property, both internally and externally, by a qualified surveyor. Data collected include the number and type of rooms and facilities contained in the property, the condition of a wide range of aspects of the physical structure, details of the heating systems, parking provision, and assessment of neighbourhood quality. 

Market Value Survey
This is a desk-based exercise providing two market valuations for each of the core cases. The first gives the market value of the property in its current condition. The second gives the valuation after necessary repairs were undertaken (if identified from the Physical survey). Valuers also provide information about the housing market in the immediate neighbourhood in which the property is situated.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"English House Condition Survey, 1996; 2001 - 2007: Secure Access / EHCS"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"English House Condition Survey, 1996; 2001 - 2007: Secure Access / EHCS"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/english-house-condition-survey-1996-2001-2007-secure-access-ehcs"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"English House Condition Survey, 1996; 2001 - 2007: Secure Access / EHCS"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"English House Condition Survey, 1996; 2001 - 2007: Secure Access / EHCS"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
