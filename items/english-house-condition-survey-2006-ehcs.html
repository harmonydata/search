The survey was originally called the National House Condition Survey and covered England and Wales.  The information obtained through the survey provides an accurate picture of the type, condition and energy efficiency of housing in England, the people living there, and their views on housing and their neighbourhoods. The survey covers all tenure types.

The EHCS ran quinquennially from 1967-2001.  From 2002, the survey moved to a continuous basis and the data were provided as a two-year rolling sample of approximately 16,000 cases (i.e. the data for 2003 cover information collected from April 2002 to March 2004, data for 2004 comprise information collected from April 2003 to March 2005).  From April 2008, the EHCS merged with the Survey of English Housing (SEH) (available at the UK Data Archive under GN 33277) to form the English Housing Survey (EHS) (available at the Archive under GN 33422).

Further information can be found on the English House Condition Survey and English Housing Survey web pages.
 The EHCS, 2006 is the fourth survey run on a continuous basis.  The EHCS, 2006 is based on data collected in the two years of fieldwork, between April 2005 and March 2007.

For the second edition (March 2016), a new variable, SAP12, was added to the physical file, to reflect updated methodology for calculating Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) energy performance assessments.

 The EHCS consists of a number of component surveys:

Interview Survey
An interview is first conducted with the householder. The interview topics include: household characteristics, satisfaction with the home and the area, disability and adaptations to the home, work done to the property and income details.

Physical Survey
The interview is followed by a visual inspection of the property, both internally and externally, by a qualified surveyor. Data collected include the number and type of rooms and facilities contained in the property, the condition of a wide range of aspects of the physical structure, details of the heating systems, parking provision, and assessment of neighbourhood quality. 

Market Value Survey
This is a desk-based exercise providing two market valuations for each of the core cases. The first gives the market value of the property in its current condition. The second gives the valuation after necessary repairs were undertaken (if identified from the Physical survey). Valuers also provide information about the housing market in the immediate neighbourhood in which the property is situated."/><meta property="og:title" content="English House Condition Survey, 2006 / EHCS"/><meta property="og:description" content="The English House Condition Survey (EHCS) was a national survey of housing in England, commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG).
