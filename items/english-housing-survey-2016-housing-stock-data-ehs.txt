Users who only require data from the household interview should use the English Housing Survey, 2016-2017: Household Data (not currently available; will be available in due course).

Users should note that the dictionary of derived variables covering the current year will be made available in the summer, alongside the 2016-17 Technical Report.

 The EHS Housing Stock survey consists of two components.

Interview Survey
An interview is first conducted with the householder. The interview topics include: household characteristics, satisfaction with the home and the area, disability and adaptations to the home, ownership and rental details and income details. All interviewees are guaranteed confidentiality and all data are anonymised.18:["$","$L19",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"English Housing Survey, 2016: Housing Stock Data / EHS","description":"$1a","url":["https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8350"],"keywords":[],"identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-8350-1"],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UK Data Service","url":"https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8350"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government"}]},"extra_data":{"geographic_coverage":"","harmony_id":"ukds/8350","start_year":null,"end_year":null,"data_access":"Crown copyright material is reproduced with the permission of the Controller of HMSO and the Queen’s Printer for Scotland","urls":["https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8350"],"source":["ukds"],"name":"English Housing Survey, 2016: Housing Stock Data / EHS","genetic_data_collected":false,"slug":"english-housing-survey-2016-housing-stock-data-ehs","language_codes":["en"],"dois":["http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-8350-1"],"sex":"all","instruments":[],"study_design":[],"ai_summary":null,"country_codes":["GB"],"resource_type":"dataset","duration_years":null,"num_variables":null,"uuid":"a5a196006aa34ffcbcc2174c171372b9"},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]}}]

The data are made available for a two-year rolling sample i.e. approximately 12,000 cases together with the appropriate two-year weights. For example, the EHS Housing Stock data presented here are for 2016, but cover the period April 2015 to March 2017. This means that if you use more than one housing stock dataset, you must use either odd or even years. For example, you need to use the Housing Stock Dataset for '2012' and '2014' or '2013' and '2015', but not the dataset for '2014' and '2013' as you would double-count the cases surveyed between April 2013 and March 2014. The Housing Stock dataset should be used for any analysis requiring information relating to the physical characteristics and energy efficiency of the housing stock. Derived datasets provide key analytical variables compiled post-fieldwork including energy efficiency ratings, decent home indicators and equivalised income.

Users who only require data from the household interview should use the English Housing Survey, 2016-2017: Household Data (not currently available; will be available in due course).

Users should note that the dictionary of derived variables covering the current year will be made available in the summer, alongside the 2016-17 Technical Report.

 The EHS Housing Stock survey consists of two components.

Interview Survey
An interview is first conducted with the householder. The interview topics include: household characteristics, satisfaction with the home and the area, disability and adaptations to the home, ownership and rental details and income details. All interviewees are guaranteed confidentiality and all data are anonymised.10:{"metadata":[["$","title","0",{"children":"English Housing Survey, 2016: Housing Stock Data / EHS"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"$1b"}],"$L1c","$L1d","$L1e","$L1f","$L20","$L21","$L22","$L23","$L24","$L25","$L26","$L27","$L28","$L29","$L2a","$L2b"],"error":null,"digest":"$undefined"}

2c:T120e,The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a continuous national survey commissioned by the Ministry of Housing, Community and Local Government (MHCLG) that collects information about people's housing circumstances and the condition and energy efficiency of housing in England. The EHS brings together two previous survey series into a single fieldwork operation: the English House Condition Survey (EHCS) (available from the UK Data Archive under GN 33158) and the Survey of English Housing (SEH) (available under GN 33277). The EHS covers all housing tenures. The information obtained through the survey provides an accurate picture of people living in the dwelling, and their views on housing and their neighbourhoods. The survey is also used to inform the development and monitoring of the Ministry's housing policies. Results from the survey are also used by a wide range of other users including other government departments, local authorities, housing associations, landlords, academics, construction industry professionals, consultants, and the general public.
The EHS has a complex multi-stage methodology consisting of two main elements; an initial interview survey of around 12,000 households and a follow-up physical inspection. Some further elements are also periodically included in or derived from the EHS: for 2008 and 2009, a desk-based market valuation was conducted of a sub-sample of 8,000 dwellings (including vacant ones), but this was not carried out from 2010 onwards. A periodic follow-up survey of private landlords and agents (the Private Landlords Survey (PLS)) is conducted using information from the EHS interview survey. Fuel Poverty datasets are also available from 2003, created by the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC).

The EHS interview survey sample formed part of the Integrated Household Survey (IHS) (available from the Archive under GN 33420) from April 2008 to April 2011. During this period the core questions from the IHS formed part of the EHS questionnaire.

End User Licence and Special Licence Versions:
From 2014 data onwards, the End User Licence (EUL) versions of the EHS will only include derived variables. In addition the number of variables on the new EUL datasets has been reduced and disclosure control increased on certain remaining variables. New Special Licence versions of the EHS will be deposited later in the year, which will be of a similar nature to previous EHS EUL datasets and will include derived and raw datasets.

Further information about the EHS and the latest news, reports and tables can be found on the GOV.UK English Housing Survey  web pages.
 The English Housing Survey, 2016: Housing Stock Data is available for all cases where a physical survey has been completed. For occupied cases the data comprises information from the household interview and from the physical survey. For vacant properties only, data from the physical survey are provided. The study only includes derived variables.
