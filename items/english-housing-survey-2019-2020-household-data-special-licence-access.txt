From 2014 data onwards, the End User Licence (EUL) versions of the EHS only include derived variables. In addition the number of variables on the EUL datasets from that date has been reduced and disclosure control increased on certain remaining variables. The new Special Licence versions of the EHS, which are subject to more restrictive access conditions, are of a similar nature to EHS EUL datasets prior to 2014 and include both derived and raw datasets.

Further information about the EHS and the latest news, reports and tables can be found on the GOV.UK English Housing Survey  web pages.

Housing Survey 2019 to 2020: headline report.

The EHS Housing survey consists of two components.

Interview survey on the participating household - An interview is first conducted with the householder. The interview topics include: household characteristics, satisfaction with the home and the area, disability and adaptations to the home, ownership and rental details and income details. All interviewees are guaranteed confidentiality and all data is anonymised.
 Physical survey on the housing Stock - Where interviews were achieved (the ‘full household sample’), each year all rented properties and a sub-sample of owner occupied properties are regarded as eligible for the physical survey and the respondent’s consent is sought. A proportion of vacant properties were also sub-sampled. For all physical survey cases, a visual inspection of both the interior and exterior of the dwelling is carried out by a qualified surveyor to assess the condition and energy efficiency of the dwelling.  Topics covered include whether the dwelling meets the Decent Homes Standard; cost to make the dwelling decent; existence of damp and  Category 1 Hazards as measured by the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS); Energy Efficiency Rating.

This dataset contains data from the interview survey only.  The data from the physical survey are available in a separate deposit (the Housing Stock Dataset).e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"English Housing Survey, 2019-2020: Household Data: Special Licence Access"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"English Housing Survey, 2019-2020: Household Data: Special Licence Access"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/english-housing-survey-2019-2020-household-data-special-licence-access"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"English Housing Survey, 2019-2020: Household Data: Special Licence Access"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"English Housing Survey, 2019-2020: Household Data: Special Licence Access"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
