Some further elements are also periodically included in or derived from the EHS: for 2008 and 2009, a desk-based market valuation was conducted of a sub-sample of 8,000 dwellings (including vacant ones), but this was not carried out from 2010 onwards.

 The English Housing Survey: Housing Stock Data, 2010/11-2012/13: Three-Year Weights Lookup File contains four variables to match to the EHS Three-Year Housing Stock dataset. This is not provided with the weights look-up file but can be created by obtaining the EHS 2011 and 2012 Housing Stock datasets (SNs 7386 and 7511 respectively) and merging the two files together to create a three-year dataset covering 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13. The weights for the three component years are individually calibrated to the mid-point of October 2011. The three years' weights are then aggregated before being scaled down to the appropriate totals by being divided by three.

The three-year paired weights are used for analysis of small groups when the combined two-year housing stock dataset is not sufficient. However, the weighting methodology for the three-year weight does not give as reliable a result as that for the one- and two-year weights. The depositor advises that users should be aware these data can easily be more biased than plentiful. Users should also note that the three-year paired weights can only be used on the EHS housing stock dataset and not with the household data.18:Tee8,The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a continuous national survey commissioned by the Ministry of Housing, Community and Local Government (MHCLG) that collects information about people's housing circumstances and the condition and energy efficiency of housing in England. The EHS brings together two previous survey series into a single fieldwork operation: the English House Condition Survey (EHCS) (available from the UK Data Archive under GN 33158) and the Survey of English Housing (SEH) (available under GN 33277). The EHS covers all housing tenures. The information obtained through the survey provides an accurate picture of people living in the dwelling, and their views on housing and their neighbourhoods. The survey is also used to inform the development and monitoring of the Ministry's housing policies. Results from the survey are also used by a wide range of other users including other government departments, local authorities, housing associations, landlords, academics, construction industry professionals, consultants, and the general public.
The EHS has a complex multi-stage methodology consisting of two main elements; an initial interview survey of around 12,000 households and a follow-up physical inspection. Some further elements are also periodically included in or derived from the EHS: for 2008 and 2009, a desk-based market valuation was conducted of a sub-sample of 8,000 dwellings (including vacant ones), but this was not carried out from 2010 onwards. A periodic follow-up survey of private landlords and agents (the Private Landlords Survey (PLS)) is conducted using information from the EHS interview survey. Fuel Poverty datasets are also available from 2003, created by the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC).

The EHS interview survey sample formed part of the Integrated Household Survey (IHS) (available from the Archive under GN 33420) from April 2008 to April 2011. During this period the core questions from the IHS formed part of the EHS questionnaire.

End User Licence and Special Licence Versions:
From 2014 data onwards, the End User Licence (EUL) versions of the EHS will only include derived variables. In addition the number of variables on the new EUL datasets has been reduced and disclosure control increased on certain remaining variables. New Special Licence versions of the EHS will be deposited later in the year, which will be of a similar nature to previous EHS EUL datasets and will include derived and raw datasets.
