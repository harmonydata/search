The ELSA Data team have found some issues with historical data measuring health conditions. If you are intending to do any analysis looking at the following health conditions, then please contact elsadata@natcen.ac.uk for advice on how you should approach your analysis. The affected conditions are: eye conditions (glaucoma; diabetic eye disease; macular degeneration; cataract), CVD conditions (high blood pressure; angina; heart attack; Congestive Heart Failure; heart murmur; abnormal heart rhythm; diabetes; stroke; high cholesterol; other heart trouble) and chronic health conditions (chronic lung disease; asthma; arthritis; osteoporosis; cancer; Parkinson&#x27;s Disease; emotional, nervous or psychiatric problems; Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease; dementia; malignant blood disorder; multiple sclerosis or motor neurone disease).Secure Access Data:Secure Access versions of ELSA have more restrictive access conditions than versions available under the standard End User Licence or Special Licence (see &#x27;Access&#x27; section below).Secure Access versions of ELSA include:Primary Data from Wave 8 onwards (SN 8444) includes all the variables in the SL primary dataset (SN 8346) as well as day of birth, combined SIC 2003 code (5 digit), combined SOC 2000 code (4 digit), NS-SEC long version including and excluding unclassifiable and non-workers.Pension Age Data from Wave 8 onwards (SN 8445) includes all the variables in the SL pension age data (SN 8375) as well as year reached pension age variable.Detailed geographical identifier files for each wave, grouped by identifier held under SN 8423 (Index of Multiple Deprivation Score), SN 8424 (Local Authority District Pre-2009 Boundaries), SN 8438 (Local Authority District Post-2009 Boundaries), SN 8425 (Census 2001 Lower Layer Super Output Areas), SN 8434 (Census 2011 Lower Layer Super Output Areas), SN 8426(Census 2001 Middle Layer Super Output Areas), SN 8435 (Census 2011 Middle Layer Super Output Areas), SN 8427 (Population Density for Postcode Sectors), SN 8428 (Census 2001 Rural-Urban Indicators), SN 8436 (Census 2011 Rural-Urban Indicators).Where boundary changes have occurred, the geographic identifier has been split into two separate studies to reduce the risk of disclosure. Users are also only allowed one version of each identifier:either SN 8424 (Local Authority District Pre-2009 Boundaries) or SN 8438 (Local Authority District Post-2009 Boundaries)either SN 8425 (Census 2001 Lower Layer Super Output Areas) or SN 8434 (Census 2011 Lower Layer Super Output Areas)either SN 8426 (Census 2001 Middle Layer Super Output Areas) or SN 8435 (Census 2011 Middle Layer Super Output Areas)either SN 8428 (Census 2001 Rural-Urban Indicators) or SN 8436 (Census 2011 Rural-Urban Indicators)

This dataset contains a Census 2001 Lower Layer Super Output Area variable for each Wave of ELSA to date, and a unique individual serial number variable is also included for matching to the main data files. These data have more restrictive access conditions than those available under the standard End User Licence or Special Licence (see &#x27;Access&#x27; section). Latest edition informationFor the second edition (October 2024), data for waves 9 and 10 have been added to the study and data for waves 1 to 8 have been updated.

The main objectives of ELSA are to:construct waves of accessible and well-documented panel data;provide these data in a convenient and timely fashion to the scientific and policy research community;describe health trajectories, disability and healthy life expectancy in a representative sample of the English population aged 50 and over;examine the relationship between economic position and health;investigate the determinants of economic position in older age;describe the timing of retirement and post-retirement labour market activity; andunderstand the relationships between social support, household structure and the transfer of assets.Further information may be found on the the ELSA project website or the Natcen Social Research: ELSA web pages.Health conditions research with ELSA - June 2021\nThe ELSA Data team have found some issues with historical data measuring health conditions.
