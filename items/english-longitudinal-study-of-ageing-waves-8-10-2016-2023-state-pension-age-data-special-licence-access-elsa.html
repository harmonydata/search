construct waves of accessible and well-documented panel data;
provide these data in a convenient and timely fashion to the scientific and policy research community;
describe health trajectories, disability and healthy life expectancy in a representative sample of the English population aged 50 and over;
examine the relationship between economic position and health;
nvestigate the determinants of economic position in older age;
describe the timing of retirement and post-retirement labour market activity; and
understand the relationships between social support, household structure and the transfer of assets.

Health conditions research with ELSA - June 2021
The ELSA Data team have found some issues with historical data measuring health conditions. If you are intending to do any analysis looking at the following health conditions, then please contact the ELSA Data team at NatCen on elsadata@natcen.ac.uk for advice on how you should approach your analysis. The affected conditions are: eye conditions (glaucoma; diabetic eye disease; macular degeneration; cataract), CVD conditions (high blood pressure; angina; heart attack; Congestive Heart Failure; heart murmur; abnormal heart rhythm; diabetes; stroke; high cholesterol; other heart trouble) and chronic health conditions (chronic lung disease; asthma; arthritis; osteoporosis; cancer; Parkinson&#x27;s Disease; emotional, nervous or psychiatric problems; Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease; dementia; malignant blood disorder; multiple sclerosis or motor neurone disease).
Special Licence Data:
Special Licence Access versions of ELSA have more restrictive access conditions than versions available under the standard End User Licence (see &#x27;Access&#x27; section below). Users are advised to obtain the latest edition of SN 5050 (the End User Licence version) before making an application for Special Licence data, to see whether that is suitable for their needs. A separate application must be made for each Special Licence study. Special Licence Access versions of ELSA include:

Primary data from Wave 8 onwards (SN 8346) includes all the variables in the EUL primary dataset (SN 5050) as well as year and month of birth, consolidated ethnicity and country of birth, marital status, and more detailed medical history variables.
Wave 8 Pension Age Data (SN 8375) includes all the variables in the EUL pension age data (SN 5050) as well as year and age reached state pension age variables.
Wave 8 Sexual Self-Completion Data (SN 8376) includes sensitive variables from the sexual self-completion questionnaire.
Wave 3 (2007) Harmonized Life History (SN 8831) includes retrospective information on previous histories, specifically, detailed data on previous partnership, children, residential, health, and work histories.
Detailed geographical identifier files for Waves 1-10 which are grouped by identifier held under SN 8429 (Local Authority District Pre-2009 Boundaries), SN 8439 (Local Authority District Post-2009 Boundaries), SN 8430 (Local Authority Type Pre-2009 Boundaries), SN 8441 (Local Authority Type Post-2009 Boundaries), SN 8431 (Quintile Index of Multiple Deprivation Score), SN 8432 (Quintile Population Density for Postcode Sectors), SN 8433 (Census 2001 Rural-Urban Indicators), SN 8437 (Census 2011 Rural-Urban Indicators).

Where boundary changes have occurred, the geographic identifier has been split into two separate studies to reduce the risk of disclosure. Users are also only allowed one version of each identifier:

either SN 8429 (Local Authority District Pre-2009 Boundaries) or SN 8439 (Local Authority District Post-2009 Boundaries)
either SN 8430 (Local Authority Type Pre-2009 Boundaries) or SN 8441(Local Authority Type Post-2009 Boundaries)
either SN 8433 (Census 2001 Rural-Urban Indicators) or SN 8437 (Census 2011 Rural-Urban Indicators)

ELSA Wave 6 and Wave 8 Self-Completion Questionnaires included an open-ended question where respondents could add any other comments they may wish to note down. These responses have been transcribed and anonymised. Researchers can request access to these transcribed responses for research purposes by contacting the ELSA Data Team at NatCen."/><meta property="og:title" content="English Longitudinal Study of Ageing: Waves 8-10, 2016-2023, State Pension Age Data: Special Licence Access / ELSA"/><meta property="og:description" content="The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) study is a longitudinal survey of ageing and quality of life among older people that explores the dynamic relationships between health and functioning, social networks and participation, and economic position as people plan for, move into and progress beyond retirement.

The main objectives of ELSA are to:\n\nconstruct waves of accessible and well-documented panel data;\nprovide these data in a convenient and timely fashion to the scientific and policy research community;\ndescribe health trajectories, disability and healthy life expectancy in a representative sample of the English population aged 50 and over;\nexamine the relationship between economic position and health;\nnvestigate the determinants of economic position in older age;\ndescribe the timing of retirement and post-retirement labour market activity; and\nunderstand the relationships between social support, household structure and the transfer of assets.\n\nFurther information may be found on the the ELSA project website or the Natcen Social Research: ELSA web pages.\nHealth conditions research with ELSA - June 2021\nThe ELSA Data team have found some issues with historical data measuring health conditions. If you are intending to do any analysis looking at the following health conditions, then please contact the ELSA Data team at NatCen on elsadata@natcen.ac.uk for advice on how you should approach your analysis. The affected conditions are: eye conditions (glaucoma; diabetic eye disease; macular degeneration; cataract), CVD conditions (high blood pressure; angina; heart attack; Congestive Heart Failure; heart murmur; abnormal heart rhythm; diabetes; stroke; high cholesterol; other heart trouble) and chronic health conditions (chronic lung disease; asthma; arthritis; osteoporosis; cancer; Parkinson's Disease; emotional, nervous or psychiatric problems; Alzheimer's Disease; dementia; malignant blood disorder; multiple sclerosis or motor neurone disease).\nSpecial Licence Data:\nSpecial Licence Access versions of ELSA have more restrictive access conditions than versions available under the standard End User Licence (see 'Access' section below). Users are advised to obtain the latest edition of SN 5050 (the End User Licence version) before making an application for Special Licence data, to see whether that is suitable for their needs. A separate application must be made for each Special Licence study. Special Licence Access versions of ELSA include:\n\nPrimary data from Wave 8 onwards (SN 8346) includes all the variables in the EUL primary dataset (SN 5050) as well as year and month of birth, consolidated ethnicity and country of birth, marital status, and more detailed medical history variables.\nWave 8 Pension Age Data (SN 8375) includes all the variables in the EUL pension age data (SN 5050) as well as year and age reached state pension age variables.\nWave 8 Sexual Self-Completion Data (SN 8376) includes sensitive variables from the sexual self-completion questionnaire.\nWave 3 (2007) Harmonized Life History (SN 8831) includes retrospective information on previous histories, specifically, detailed data on previous partnership, children, residential, health, and work histories.\nDetailed geographical identifier files for Waves 1-10 which are grouped by identifier held under SN 8429 (Local Authority District Pre-2009 Boundaries), SN 8439 (Local Authority District Post-2009 Boundaries), SN 8430 (Local Authority Type Pre-2009 Boundaries), SN 8441 (Local Authority Type Post-2009 Boundaries), SN 8431 (Quintile Index of Multiple Deprivation Score), SN 8432 (Quintile Population Density for Postcode Sectors), SN 8433 (Census 2001 Rural-Urban Indicators), SN 8437 (Census 2011 Rural-Urban Indicators).\n\nWhere boundary changes have occurred, the geographic identifier has been split into two separate studies to reduce the risk of disclosure.
