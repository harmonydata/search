The article concludes with reflections on the project's impact and recommendations for future endeavours in advancing community-driven educational initiatives.ACES will investigate and establish a transformative educational model for bridging formal and informal educational contexts via playful and participatory methodology towards a more inclusive, safe and resilient society that will empower young people to flourish despite their social localities.

ACES will focus on building resilient communities of young people in rural areas or deprived sections of urban communities through education. Young people refers to those in primary and secondary education. ACES will engage teachers and local community groups in the co-creation and ownership of the educational process, fostering an empowering and agentic practice when it comes to marginalised contexts - to motivate, ground and, most importantly, localise the intervention.

Data collection methods included surveys and interviews conducted with teachers, students, and community members. Surveys evaluated teachers' perceptions and readiness for playful and frugal education, while interviews delved into the perspectives of teachers, students, and principals on the design and implementation of a green playground.
Noteworthy findings emerged from the capability surveys for students and teachers, shedding light on motivational factors. Additionally, analyses of playful and frugal aspects of designs and activities provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of educational approaches.

The study's motivation lies in fostering educational resilience and sustainability through innovative pedagogical models. The research engages diverse stakeholders, emphasizing collaborative efforts for inclusive, safe, and resilient educational practices. The article concludes with reflections on the project's impact and recommendations for future endeavours in advancing community-driven educational initiatives.ACES will investigate and establish a transformative educational model for bridging formal and informal educational contexts via playful and participatory methodology towards a more inclusive, safe and resilient society that will empower young people to flourish despite their social localities. ACES will investigate the role of education in mobilising young people towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), taking into account the impact of wellbeing (SDG3), gender (SDG5) and poverty (SDG1) on education (SDG4) and vice-versa in Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam. ACES will focus on building resilient communities of young people in rural areas or deprived sections of urban communities through education. Young people refers to those in primary and secondary education. ACES will engage teachers and local community groups in the co-creation and ownership of the educational process, fostering an empowering and agentic practice when it comes to marginalised contexts - to motivate, ground and, most importantly, localise the intervention. The upskilling of teachers is considered as one of the most effective and direct means of achieving all of the SDG4 targets.

The effects of quality education are linked to improved development outcomes. In all three countries, access to inclusive and equitable quality education is an impending issue; however, the causes, scope and severity vary from one country to another. In Indonesia, the dominance of political, corporate and bureaucratic elites affects the provision of quality education. In Vietnam, its education system struggles to provide access and quality, although since 2008, its government allocates 20% of its national budget to improve education throughout the nation. In Malaysia, access to quality education is still an issue at remote/rural areas in the country. Even though these countries report the literacy rate of over 90%, the efforts to maintain sustainable growth in their respective economies, to reach developed status, hinge on an updated system of education that is more transformative beyond literacy. While economic growth in these countries brings positive benefits and lifts people out of poverty, societies must be equipped to respond to subsequent changes related to political and social systems. Economic resilience thus depends on social resilience, agency and capabilities to respond, design, implement and support corrective and adaptive measures. 

ACES will explore the use of playful and participatory methodology towards developing an inclusive, equitable and transformative educational model that will afford opportunities for young people, teachers and community groups to respond to challenges/changes in their community through creative and innovative practices.1d:["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:description","content":"$2c"}]

2d:T1266,This dataset contains results from a series of workshops and surveys conducted in Hoa Binh, Vietnam, as part of the ACES project. The study, spanning from September 2020 to May 2022, aimed to explore the implementation of a community-centred educational model, focusing on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and educational resilience.

The data collection process involved workshops that connected researchers with various stakeholders. These included teachers, officers from the local Department of Education and Training, student teachers at Hoa Binh College of Education, and entrepreneurs/community actors. The workshops facilitated discussions on project access, research permissions, and methodologies for subsequent surveys and interviews related to SDGs and resilience.

The study progressed with workshops addressing playfulness, frugal education, and the development of social resilience. Data collection methods included surveys and interviews conducted with teachers, students, and community members. Surveys evaluated teachers' perceptions and readiness for playful and frugal education, while interviews delved into the perspectives of teachers, students, and principals on the design and implementation of a green playground.
