In 2016, questions were added to the EPE Survey to obtain estimates of external operational expenditure (before this, information was collected only on in-house operational expenditure) and information on the profits from the disposals of any capital assets that had been used for environmental protection purposes. The EPE Survey focuses on the following four types of expenditure, as well as profits made from disposals:   External operating expenditure: Costs paid to external organisations for treatment, disposal or investigation relating to waste water management, protection of ambient air and climate, and solid waste management. In-house operating expenditure: On-site management costs for the treatment, disposal or investigation relating to waste water management, protection of ambient air and climate, and solid waste management.End of pipe capital expenditure: Capital expenditure for methods, technologies, processes or equipment designed to collect and remove pollution and pollutants after their creation. Integrated capex: investment in methods, technologies and equipment that are integrated within the businesses' overall activity, where the primary aim of the expenditure is to reduce any pollutants generated. The expenditure captured here includes only the element that specifically relates to the additional cost of the environmentally friendly process compared with a cheaper and less environmentally friendly alternative.Disposals: Profits from the disposal of any capital assets that have been used for environmental protection.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Environmental Protection Expenditure Survey, 2015-2021: Secure Access / EPE"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Environmental Protection Expenditure Survey, 2015-2021: Secure Access / EPE"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/environmental-protection-expenditure-survey-2015-2021-secure-access-epe"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Environmental Protection Expenditure Survey, 2015-2021: Secure Access / EPE"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Environmental Protection Expenditure Survey, 2015-2021: Secure Access / EPE"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
