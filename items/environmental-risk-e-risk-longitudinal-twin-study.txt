This study involves a nationally representative cohort of twins, which allows researchers to disentangle the effects of shared genetics and environmental influences.

The E-Risk study collects a wide array of data on various topics, including mental health issues, physical health conditions like obesity and asthma, educational outcomes, criminal behavior, experiences of violence, and the impact of neighborhood and family environments. Additionally, the study incorporates biological measures, such as biomarkers for inflammation, gene expression, epigenetic DNA methylation, telomere length, and neuropsychological assessments.

Key findings from the E-Risk study have contributed significantly to understanding how early life experiences and genetic predispositions interact to influence the development of mental health disorders and other behavioral outcomes. The study's longitudinal design allows for the examination of these factors over time, providing insights into the developmental trajectories of individuals and the potential for early interventions.

The significance of the E-Risk study lies in its ability to inform public health strategies and policies by identifying risk factors and protective factors that can be targeted to improve mental health and well-being across the lifespan.a:[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$12"}}],["$","$L13",null,{"dataset":{"title":"Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study","description":"E-Risk is a nationally representative twin cohort study that aims to build a knowledge about how environmental and genetic factors contribute to behaviours and the development of mental health problems from childhood through to young adulthood.
