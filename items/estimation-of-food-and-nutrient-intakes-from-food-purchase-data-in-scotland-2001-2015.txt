Other foods indicative of diet quality, such as soft drinks, cakes and savoury snacks that contribute to the nutrient goals have also been monitored.  Further analysis is facilitated by the inclusion of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) quintiles (provided by Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics).Dietary targets for Scotland were originally proposed in Eating for Health: A Diet Action Plan for Scotland in 1996 and have since been revised in 2013 and 2016 as Dietary Goals. 
Monitoring progress towards these targets/goals using the Expenditure and Food Survey (Living Costs and Food Survey since 2008) followed the endorsement of the 2004 Working Group Report on Monitoring Scottish Dietary Targets who concluded that it was the most appropriate method for Scotland.Further information can be found on the Foods Standards Scotland webpage Latest estimation of food and nutrient intakes in Scotland.
 The study includes food and nutrient data derived from the UK Expenditure and Food Survey and Living Costs and Food Survey, grouped according to the Scottish Dietary Targets/Goals and other foods and nutrients indicative of diet quality.  Derived variables and data about the sample (obtained from ONS deposited data with the UK Data Service) is also provided.  Further variables on sampling (Strata and Cluster), Gross Normal Weekly Income (GNWI) and SIMD have had to be removed from the dataset as they were obtained separately from ONS for which a Data Access Agreement (DAA) was required – it may be possible to obtain this information from ONS with an appropriate DAA.26:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2a"}]
