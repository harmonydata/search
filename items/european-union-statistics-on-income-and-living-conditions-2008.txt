The EU-SILC dataset has been produced in accordance with EU regulations under guidance from Eurostat. In addition, every year a European Commission regulation describing the list of secondary target variables (annual modules) is published (see Main Topics section for details).

The accompanying documentation for EU-SILC comprises: a Guidelines document that describes the survey, the variables including the module and recommendations given to the EU member states for data collection; and a document detailing the differences between the data collected and that held in Eurostat's User Database (UDB) (as described in the guidelines) for all member states, including the already established issues or particularities for the UK.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, 2008"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, 2008"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/european-union-statistics-on-income-and-living-conditions-2008"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, 2008"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, 2008"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
