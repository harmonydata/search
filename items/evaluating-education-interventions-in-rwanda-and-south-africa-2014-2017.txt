Thirdly, they allow for a comparison of similar interventions across two countries, which since 1994 have put in place important policy interventions to promote peace and social cohesion which warrant close scrutiny. Fourthly, both countries enable examination of the complex interrelationship between inequality and peace and social cohesion in education. 
The overarching aim of the study is to understand education policy interventions that have enabled teachers to become active agents of peacebuilding in post-conflict countries and that may inform future interventions. These objectives are achieved through an empirically grounded evaluation of the nature, implementation, and impact of programmes that are designed to support teachers as peace-builders in schools in post-conflict contexts. The project looks specifically at policies and programmes focusing on teachers, found in both South Africa and Rwanda, including those related to 1) Teacher training 2) Teacher recruitment, deployment and management 3) Curriculum and textbook reform. 
Research includes a political economy analysis of the context of these interventions in each country in order to critically embed the research in the local context, and draws upon a realist evaluation approach (Pawson, 2005).
The research team comprises an internationally diverse and interdisciplinary team of experts from the UK, South Africa, and Rwanda with expertise in teacher education, peacebuilding and conflict studies. The research team also worked closely with UNICEF in order to maximise, local, national and global impact and build knowledge and capacity in this important field.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Evaluating education interventions in Rwanda and South Africa, 2014-2017"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Evaluating education interventions in Rwanda and South Africa, 2014-2017"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/evaluating-education-interventions-in-rwanda-and-south-africa-2014-2017"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Evaluating education interventions in Rwanda and South Africa, 2014-2017"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Evaluating education interventions in Rwanda and South Africa, 2014-2017"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
