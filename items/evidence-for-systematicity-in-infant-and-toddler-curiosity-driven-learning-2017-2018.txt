We were also interested in how this curiosity-based exploration might be influenced by language.

This model predicted that when allowed to freely choose what to learn from and when, young children should learn best from an environment which is neither too simple nor too complex; that is, medium difficulty should best support learning, and importantly, children should be able to generate this level of difficulty themselves without adults structuring their learning environment on their behalf. This model was published in a high-impact interdisciplinary journal (Twomey & Westermann, 2018, Dev. Sci) and the code and data made publicly available (see Related Resources). Several international requests for re-use of this code have been made since publication.
Our empirical work aimed to test the predictions from the model. In Study 1 we showed 12- and 28-month-old toddlers 2D image and recorded where they looked and for how long. Both groups of children generated patterns of looking which were of intermediate complexity (Twomey, Malem, Ke & Westermann, in prep.). In Study 2, we allowed 12-, 18- and 24-month-old infants to play freely with custom-designed, 3D printed categories of novel objects. Again, children of all ages generated explored the objects in an order which led to medium complexity (Ke, Westermann & Twomey, in prep[a]). This study also generated a video dataset from the 12-month-old participants showing their field of view (Ke, Westermann & Twomey, in prep[b]). This dataset will allow us to conduct fine-grained analyses of their how young children visually explore the object they’re playing with, linking the findings from Studies 1 and 2. 
Overall the empirical data support the predictions of the model, providing the first evidence that not only do infants learn best from intermediate difficulty input, but critically also that they are capable of generating this level of difficulty independently. Put differently, rather than passive learners or random explorers, infants are active learners who are capable of independently tailoring their learning environment in a way that best supports their own development.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Evidence for systematicity in infant and toddler curiosity-driven learning 2017-2018"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Evidence for systematicity in infant and toddler curiosity-driven learning 2017-2018"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/evidence-for-systematicity-in-infant-and-toddler-curiosity-driven-learning-2017-2018"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Evidence for systematicity in infant and toddler curiosity-driven learning 2017-2018"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Evidence for systematicity in infant and toddler curiosity-driven learning 2017-2018"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
