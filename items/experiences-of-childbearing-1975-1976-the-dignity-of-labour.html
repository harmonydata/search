Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
A)Mothers
Information about previous pregnancies. Details of recent pregnancy including: arrangements for the birth; ante-natal care; preparation classes; medical symptoms experienced; worries and anxieties; sources of information; desire for further knowledge; whether induction/pain relief discussed and attitude towards. Details of baby&#x27;s birth including: whether labour spontaneous or induced; reasons for induction and feelings; whether labour was accelerated and reasons; whether received pain relief; whether baby&#x27;s heart monitored; whether husband present; accessibility of doctor/nurse; opinion of help received. Length of post-natal stay, contact with baby, method of feeding, problems/feelings following birth and on returning home. Comparison of experience with previous pregnancies, attitude to future maternity care. Whether information offered about birth control, choice of contraceptive, whether more children desired, attitude to abortion.
Additional information was collected separately from women who had their babies at home. Details included: post-natal hospital admissions; accessibility of doctor or midwife; whether left alone at any time; who attended the delivery.
B)Obstetricians
Perceived advantages and disadvantages of induction, whether induction would be recommended given certain circumstances, methods used, % of births induced or accelerated, % of births induced for non-medical reasons, who explains procedure to patient. Effect of induction on baby&#x27;s health/mother-baby relationship/mother&#x27;s health. Opinion of use of epidurals, % of women who receive one/are offered one and whether this makes induction more likely, estimated demand for induction/epidurals/home delivery if choice available. Whether foetal monitoring/ultra sound/amniocentesis available, % of deliveries needing an episiotomy.
C)Midwives
As for obstetricians with addition of questions on personal preference for induction, epidural and home delivery in the event of a future pregnancy.
D)Medical Records
A comparison was made between some of the medical information obtained from mothers with data available from medical records. Information included; hospital admissions during pregnancy, previous obstetric history, problems during pregnancy, gestation, Caesarean sections, induction and acceleration, anaesthesia, delivery, post-natal problems of mother and baby.
Background Variables
A)Mothers
Age at baby&#x27;s birth, age left school, further education or training, husband&#x27;s occupation, respondent&#x27;s occupation, stage of pregnancy at which stopped work, whether currently working, nationality.
B)Obstetricians
Sex, age, type of appointment.
C)Midwives
