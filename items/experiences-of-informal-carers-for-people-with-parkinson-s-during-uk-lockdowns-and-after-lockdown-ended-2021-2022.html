Early findings have shown the extent this action had on the wellbeing of the general population. However, it was expected the impact was more pronounced on individuals living with chronic illness, or those supporting them. This study aimed to longitudinally understand the effects of lockdown on carers of people living with Parkinson’s, and how their experiences evolved after lockdown ended. Nine participants (3 male, 6 female, aged 64-79) were recruited through Parkinson’s UK and a university Parkinson’s Research Database. Participants were interviewed via telephone on two occasions: the first occasion participants discussed their experiences of lockdowns (from March 2020 to June 2021) in relation to supporting their spouse as well as their own challenges. In the second interview (completed five months after the first round of interviews) participants reflected on their experiences of life post-lockdown and the effects lockdown had on their reintegration into society. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, four themes emerged from participant interviews: (i) Lockdown-induced revolution and evolution of relationship dynamic with spouse; (ii) Fighting to be seen, heard, and understood in healthcare encounters; (iii) Making sense of, and adapting to, risk in a time of COVID-19; and (iv) Isolated and needing support during and after lockdown. Themes are illustrated with data excerpts from both data collection points. Findings show that a perceived sense of control and access to Parkinson’s support were central factors that shaped both participants’ experiences of managing during lockdown and their beliefs surrounding their relationship dynamic with their spouse post-lockdown .When COVID-19 emerged, lockdowns were implemented to restrict the rate of transmission.

transmission. Early findings have shown the extent this action had on the wellbeing of the general population. However, it was expected the impact was more pronounced on individuals living with chronic illness, or those supporting them. This study aimed to longitudinally understand the effects of lockdown on carers of people living with Parkinson’s, and how their experiences evolved after lockdown ended. Nine participants (3 male, 6 female, aged 64-79) were recruited through Parkinson’s UK and a university Parkinson’s Research Database. Participants were interviewed via telephone on two occasions: the first occasion participants discussed their experiences of lockdowns (from March 2020 to June 2021) in relation to supporting their spouse as well as their own challenges. In the second interview (completed five months after the first round of interviews) participants reflected on their experiences of life post-lockdown and the effects lockdown had on their reintegration into society. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, four themes emerged from participant interviews: (i) Lockdown-induced revolution and evolution of relationship dynamic with spouse; (ii) Fighting to be seen, heard, and understood in healthcare encounters; (iii) Making sense of, and adapting to, risk in a time of COVID-19; and (iv) Isolated and needing support during and after lockdown. Themes are illustrated with data excerpts from both data collection points. Findings show that a perceived sense of control and access to Parkinson’s support were central factors that shaped both participants’ experiences of managing during lockdown and their beliefs surrounding their relationship dynamic with their spouse post-lockdown .When COVID-19 emerged, lockdowns were implemented to restrict the rate of transmission.
