Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, four themes emerged from participant interviews: (i) Lockdown-induced revolution and evolution of relationship dynamic with spouse; (ii) Fighting to be seen, heard, and understood in healthcare encounters; (iii) Making sense of, and adapting to, risk in a time of COVID-19; and (iv) Isolated and needing support during and after lockdown. Themes are illustrated with data excerpts from both data collection points. 

Findings show that a perceived sense of control and access to Parkinson’s support were central factors that shaped both participants’ experiences of managing during lockdown and their beliefs surrounding their relationship dynamic with their spouse post-lockdown .e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Experiences of Informal Carers for People with Parkinson's During UK Lockdowns and after Lockdown Ended, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Experiences of Informal Carers for People with Parkinson's During UK Lockdowns and after Lockdown Ended, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/experiences-of-informal-carers-for-people-with-parkinson-s-during-uk-lockdowns-and-after-lockdown-ended-2021-2022"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Experiences of Informal Carers for People with Parkinson's During UK Lockdowns and after Lockdown Ended, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Experiences of Informal Carers for People with Parkinson's During UK Lockdowns and after Lockdown Ended, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
