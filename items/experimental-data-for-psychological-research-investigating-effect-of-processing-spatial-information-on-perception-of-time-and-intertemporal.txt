Contrary to our primary hypotheses, the spatial primes had no effect on either perceived wait time or temporal discounting. Processing spatial information in a map-based task therefore appears to influence how people conceptualise the passage of time, but there was no evidence for downstream effects on intertemporal preferences. Exploratory analysis indicated that greater perceived control was associated with lower temporal discounting, mediated by a reduction in perceived wait time, suggesting a possible area for future research into individual differences and interventions in intertemporal decision-making.Data relating to MSc and PhD research conducted by Daniel Fletcher, funded by ESRC as part of a 1+3 programme at University of Nottingham within the Midlands Graduate School.28:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2c"}]
