After that point, the survey data, practitioner interviews and focus groups can be made available, but with the stipulation that users need to be registered with the UK Data Service, and the copyright holders need to approve each request. This is because of the sensitivity of the data and our ethical commitment to preventing the decontextualised citation of these data for purposes that were not consistent with the original aims and values of the research team. The 36 qualitative interviews with survey participants are not suitable for sharing because they include extremely detailed accounts of participants' intimate relationships and stories of experiencing or using abusive behaviours within these relationships. Many of the incidents and relationship dynamics recounted are very distinctive and impossible to anonymise without severely compromising the quality and usefulness of the data. 

Transcripts have been provided in a non-editable PDF format to protect the integrity of the data.
