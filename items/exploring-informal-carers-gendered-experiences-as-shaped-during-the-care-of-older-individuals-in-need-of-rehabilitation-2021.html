Data collection occurred between July 2021 and October 2021 and involved in-depth qualitative interviews with 11 spousal caregivers. Participants were purposefully selected to capture diverse caregiving trajectories while focusing on shared experiences of caregiving within a Greek cultural context. The interviews examined the caregivers’ lifeworld, including the emotional, social, and practical dimensions of caregiving, and their insights into the impact of caregiving on their identity and relationships. The study findings aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of spousal caregiving in the rehabilitation setting and inform future support strategies for caregiversThe overarching aim of this project was to explore what it is like the experience of gender for spousal caregivers of older people undergoing rehabilitation within the Greek community. The objectives to support the inquiry were a) to describe the gendered patterns of perception, thought, feelings and behaviour of spousal caregivers, b) to investigate the normative structures that constitute the experience of gender, and c) to explore the sense of agency in the experience of gender. This project used a phenomenological qualitative method design to investigate the experience of gender as culturally and institutionally constructed and, at the same time, intentionally and subjectively lived. The phenomenological analysis of the transcripts of the eleven participants recruited for this study provided insight into the structure of the experience of gender for the spousal caregivers as a normative diachronic identity in a succession of phases: normative constitution, alienation, and reparation offering a tentative framework for examining spousal caregivers&#x27; experiences and psychological outcomes in the caregiving trajectory from a gender perspective. The findings illuminate the influence of stereotypical attributes linked to femininity and masculinity on self-concept, agency, and the formulation of caregiving evaluations and practices highlighting the importance of incorporating an intersectional perspective in future research and interventions with caregivers, considering factors such as gender, sexuality, gender relations, age, division of labour, power dynamics, cultural norms, and values. The results indicate that both male and female caregivers feel alienated upon embarking on the caregiving journey, with specific gender-based vulnerabilities that impact their psychological well-being. By recognizing these vulnerabilities and addressing gendered expectations and societal pressures, interventions can foster caregivers&#x27; mental health and facilitate the development of effective coping strategies. The findings emphasise the complexity of empathy and its connection to the experience of stressors and coping strategies employed by caregivers. They also shed light on the multifaceted nature of guilt experienced by caregivers, elucidating its sources and connection to gendered self-perception while highlighting its effects on caregivers&#x27; well-being. The research highlights the moral dimension of caregiving and its relationship with a sense of obligation, gender norms and motivations. It calls for challenging self-sacrificial morals and societal norms associated with them to empower caregivers to prioritize their well-being while sustaining their motivations in caregiving. This shift in perspective can lead to a more positive and fulfilling caregiving experience."/><meta property="og:title" content="Exploring Informal Carers&#x27; Gendered Experiences as Shaped During the Care of Older Individuals in Need of Rehabilitation, 2021"/><meta property="og:description" content="The phenomenological research study at the University of Ioannina explored the lived experiences of spousal caregivers providing rehabilitation care for older individuals with brain injury-related disorders.

Informal Carers' Gendered Experiences as Shaped During the Care of Older Individuals in Need of Rehabilitation, 2021\",\"description\":\"The phenomenological research study at the University of Ioannina explored the lived experiences of spousal caregivers providing rehabilitation care for older individuals with brain injury-related disorders. Data collection occurred between July 2021 and October 2021 and involved in-depth qualitative interviews with 11 spousal caregivers. Participants were purposefully selected to capture diverse caregiving trajectories while focusing on shared experiences of caregiving within a Greek cultural context. The interviews examined the caregivers’ lifeworld, including the emotional, social, and practical dimensions of caregiving, and their insights into the impact of caregiving on their identity and relationships. The study findings aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of spousal caregiving in the rehabilitation setting and inform future support strategies for caregiversThe overarching aim of this project was to explore what it is like the experience of gender for spousal caregivers of older people undergoing rehabilitation within the Greek community. The objectives to support the inquiry were a) to describe the gendered patterns of perception, thought, feelings and behaviour of spousal caregivers, b) to investigate the normative structures that constitute the experience of gender, and c) to explore the sense of agency in the experience of gender. This project used a phenomenological qualitative method design to investigate the experience of gender as culturally and institutionally constructed and, at the same time, intentionally and subjectively lived. The phenomenological analysis of the transcripts of the eleven participants recruited for this study provided insight into the structure of the experience of gender for the spousal caregivers as a normative diachronic identity in a succession of phases: normative constitution, alienation, and reparation offering a tentative framework for examining spousal caregivers' experiences and psychological outcomes in the caregiving trajectory from a gender perspective. The findings illuminate the influence of stereotypical attributes linked to femininity and masculinity on self-concept, agency, and the formulation of caregiving evaluations and practices highlighting the importance of incorporating an intersectional perspective in future research and interventions with caregivers, considering factors such as gender, sexuality, gender relations, age, division of labour, power dynamics, cultural norms, and values. The results indicate that both male and female caregivers feel alienated upon embarking on the caregiving journey, with specific gender-based vulnerabilities that impact their psychological well-being. By recognizing these vulnerabilities and addressing gendered expectations and societal pressures, interventions can foster caregivers' mental health and facilitate the development of effective coping strategies. The findings emphasise the complexity of empathy and its connection to the experience of stressors and coping strategies employed by caregivers. They also shed light on the multifaceted nature of guilt experienced by caregivers, elucidating its sources and connection to gendered self-perception while highlighting its effects on caregivers' well-being. The research highlights the moral dimension of caregiving and its relationship with a sense of obligation, gender norms and motivations. It calls for challenging self-sacrificial morals and societal norms associated with them to empower caregivers to prioritize their well-being while sustaining their motivations in caregiving. This shift in perspective can lead to a more positive and fulfilling caregiving experience.\",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/exploring-informal-carers-gendered-experiences-as-shaped-during-the-care-of-older-individuals-in-need-of-rehabilitation-2021\",\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-857653\"],\"keywords\":[\"INFORMAL CARE\",\"GENDER IDENTITY\",\"GENDER ROLE\",\"REHABILITATION (MEDICAL)\",\"PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING\",\"PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS\"],\"temporalCoverage\":\"2021-07-01/2021-10-31\"}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"15:Te67,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"The phenomenological research study at the University of Ioannina explored the lived experiences of spousal caregivers providing rehabilitation care for older individuals with brain injury-related disorders.
