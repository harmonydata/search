Results: Eighty-eight studies were included in the review consisting of (n=84) empirical case study and (n=4) non-empirical papers. Case study research has been conducted globally, with a range of populations across different settings. The majority were conducted in a community setting (57%) and with populations experiencing neurodevelopmental disorder (38%) and stroke (17%) as well as non-diagnosis specific (15%). Methodologies adopted quantitative (50%), mixed methods (26%) and qualitative designs (24%). However, identifying the methodology and ‘case’ was a challenge due to methodological inconsistencies.  
Conclusions: Case study research is useful when large scale inquiry is not appropriate; for cases of complexity, early intervention efficacy, theory testing or when small participant numbers are available. It appears a viable methodology to contribute to the evidence base for occupation and health as it has been used to evaluate interventions across a breadth of occupational therapy practice contexts. Viability could be enhanced through consistent conduct and reporting to allow pooling of case data. A conceptual model and description of case study research in occupational therapy is proposed to support this.2a:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2e"}]
