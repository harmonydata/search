This project will bring together statutory partners, third sector organisations, senior national policy/decision-makers, and children with lived experiences. It will provide a unique opportunity to gather insight and to produce impactful recommendations. By involving and working with children in our project, we will address the usual top-down research hierarchies inherent in youth justice research and ensure that children's voices are prioritised.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Exploring the Impacts of COVID-19 on the Youth Justice System, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Exploring the Impacts of COVID-19 on the Youth Justice System, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/exploring-the-impacts-of-covid-19-on-the-youth-justice-system-2021-2022"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Exploring the Impacts of COVID-19 on the Youth Justice System, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Exploring the Impacts of COVID-19 on the Youth Justice System, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
