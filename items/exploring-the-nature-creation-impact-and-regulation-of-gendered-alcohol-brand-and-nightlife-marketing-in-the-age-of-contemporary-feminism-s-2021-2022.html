In recent years, changes in how women are presented and addressed in marketing, including alcohol marketing, have been observed. This reflects the shifting social, political and regulatory context, in which increased attention has been given to gender inequality and the damaging impact of gender stereotypes. Whilst alcohol brands have begun to draw on messages of gender equality to target the female market, nightlife venues have become increasingly sexualised by objectifying and sexualising women, and it is in these spaces that women experience gender equalities such as unwanted sexual attention. Research is yet to explore how women are both targeted and represented in alcohol brand and nightlife venue marketing within the current context of contemporary feminism. This research aimed to address this gap by exploring the nature and influence of such marketing on women’s identity making and experiences of drinking and the night time environment, including the inequalities at play. It also aimed to explore how female targeted alcohol marketing impacts women who do not consume alcohol due to problem use. Methods included an analysis of alcohol brand and venue marketing and group discussions and interviews with women using photo elicitation. The research addressed a number of topics including; how women are targeted and represented in alcohol marketing and how this has changed over time including the use of gender stereotypes, the sexualisation of women, and the use of gender equality, empowerment and feminist messages. Through individual and group interviews it aimed to gain in depth insight into women’s experience of drinking and the night time environment and the pleasures and risks involved, and their views on alcohol brand and venue marketing and its impact on their drinking practices. This included their views on the sexualisation and objectification of women and how this impacts their sense of safety and experience of night time venues, and how they relate and perceive marketing that associates with gender equality and empowerment. The data collections consists of transcripts of group and individual interviews with women.This research will improve our understanding of how the gendered marketing of alcohol and the night time environment (NTE) affects women&#x27;s consumption of alcohol, and their experiences of the NTE, with the aim of engaging with key stakeholders (e.g. young people, industry) to make venues healthier, safer and more inclusive. Although alcohol use and related harms are more prevalent among men than women, this gender gap has narrowed in recent years. Women are active participants in the NTE, and like men, drink for pleasure and intoxication, and to foster group belonging, bonding and friendship. This convergence in men and women&#x27;s drinking patterns can be partly explained by the shifting social positions of women, including their increased economic independence. The increased affordability of alcohol, changes to the NTE to make it more female friendly and the way in which women have been targeted by alcohol marketing are other important, yet under researched factors.

Alcohol marketing targets men and women in different ways, but both aim to increase sales and forge brand loyalty. However, women drinkers face contradictory marketing messages. They are targeted through messages of empowerment (e.g. sexual expression, independence), but also gender stereotypes (e.g. &#x27;pink marketing&#x27;), and are subject to objectification and sexualisation to promote alcohol products to men. NTE (e.g. bars and clubs) marketing also reinforces gender stereotypes and the sexualisation and objectification of women. This includes the increasing use of social media marketing, and sexualised photographs of female customers and &#x27;influencers&#x27; (e.g. online promotors). Such marketing may not only influence women&#x27;s drinking practices and experiences, but sexist content may reinforce negative attitudes towards women, gender stereotypes, and relations between men and women. This may create an environment in which sexist behaviour (e.g. unwanted sexual attention) is tolerated, which can undermine campaigns aimed at addressing sexual violence in the NTE, and advances in women&#x27;s rights and equality more generally.

The way in which alcohol products are promoted through gender-specific messages appears to be changing, and there is industry concern that sexist marketing may alienate female customers. Instead, feminist messages (e.g. choice, empowerment, addressing the gender pay gap), gender non-conformity (e.g. trans rights, gender transgression) and sexual (e.g. Love is Love) and racial (e.g."/><meta property="og:title" content="Exploring the Nature, Creation, Impact and Regulation of Gendered Alcohol Brand and Nightlife Marketing in the Age of Contemporary Feminism(s), 2021-2022"/><meta property="og:description" content="Alcohol marketing helps shape how gender roles and relations are understood, and the gendered nature of drinking learned.

the Nature, Creation, Impact and Regulation of Gendered Alcohol Brand and Nightlife Marketing in the Age of Contemporary Feminism(s), 2021-2022\",\"description\":\"Alcohol marketing helps shape how gender roles and relations are understood, and the gendered nature of drinking learned. In recent years, changes in how women are presented and addressed in marketing, including alcohol marketing, have been observed. This reflects the shifting social, political and regulatory context, in which increased attention has been given to gender inequality and the damaging impact of gender stereotypes. Whilst alcohol brands have begun to draw on messages of gender equality to target the female market, nightlife venues have become increasingly sexualised by objectifying and sexualising women, and it is in these spaces that women experience gender equalities such as unwanted sexual attention. Research is yet to explore how women are both targeted and represented in alcohol brand and nightlife venue marketing within the current context of contemporary feminism. This research aimed to address this gap by exploring the nature and influence of such marketing on women’s identity making and experiences of drinking and the night time environment, including the inequalities at play. It also aimed to explore how female targeted alcohol marketing impacts women who do not consume alcohol due to problem use. Methods included an analysis of alcohol brand and venue marketing and group discussions and interviews with women using photo elicitation. The research addressed a number of topics including; how women are targeted and represented in alcohol marketing and how this has changed over time including the use of gender stereotypes, the sexualisation of women, and the use of gender equality, empowerment and feminist messages. Through individual and group interviews it aimed to gain in depth insight into women’s experience of drinking and the night time environment and the pleasures and risks involved, and their views on alcohol brand and venue marketing and its impact on their drinking practices. This included their views on the sexualisation and objectification of women and how this impacts their sense of safety and experience of night time venues, and how they relate and perceive marketing that associates with gender equality and empowerment. The data collections consists of transcripts of group and individual interviews with women.This research will improve our understanding of how the gendered marketing of alcohol and the night time environment (NTE) affects women's consumption of alcohol, and their experiences of the NTE, with the aim of engaging with key stakeholders (e.g. young people, industry) to make venues healthier, safer and more inclusive. Although alcohol use and related harms are more prevalent among men than women, this gender gap has narrowed in recent years. Women are active participants in the NTE, and like men, drink for pleasure and intoxication, and to foster group belonging, bonding and friendship. This convergence in men and women's drinking patterns can be partly explained by the shifting social positions of women, including their increased economic independence. The increased affordability of alcohol, changes to the NTE to make it more female friendly and the way in which women have been targeted by alcohol marketing are other important, yet under researched factors.\\n\\nAlcohol marketing targets men and women in different ways, but both aim to increase sales and forge brand loyalty. However, women drinkers face contradictory marketing messages. They are targeted through messages of empowerment (e.g. sexual expression, independence), but also gender stereotypes (e.g. 'pink marketing'), and are subject to objectification and sexualisation to promote alcohol products to men. NTE (e.g. bars and clubs) marketing also reinforces gender stereotypes and the sexualisation and objectification of women. This includes the increasing use of social media marketing, and sexualised photographs of female customers and 'influencers' (e.g. online promotors). Such marketing may not only influence women's drinking practices and experiences, but sexist content may reinforce negative attitudes towards women, gender stereotypes, and relations between men and women. This may create an environment in which sexist behaviour (e.g. unwanted sexual attention) is tolerated, which can undermine campaigns aimed at addressing sexual violence in the NTE, and advances in women's rights and equality more generally.\\n\\nThe way in which alcohol products are promoted through gender-specific messages appears to be changing, and there is industry concern that sexist marketing may alienate female customers.
