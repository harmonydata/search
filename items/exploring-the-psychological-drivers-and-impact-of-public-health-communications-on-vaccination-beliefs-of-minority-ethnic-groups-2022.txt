They also demonstrated the effectiveness of co-produced, two-way local communications using trusted expert sources and communication channels that are preferred by communities. Resident interviews highlighted differences within- and between- minority ethnic group attitudes and experiences. They also indicated that anti-vax messages were being shared via multiple sources with varying impacts, including on community cohesion as well as vaccine behaviours. The longitudinal design revealed that strongly positive and negative vaccine attitudes held over time, but also showed changes in attitudes, risk perceptions and behaviours relating to individual and peer experiences during the pandemic, as well as changes in government and public health responses. These findings suggest that the experience of the COVID-19 vaccine has increased delay or refusal of other routinely available vaccines, due to increased information-seeking and a desire to regain autonomy over health decision-making.Psychological drivers of behaviour can help explain why individuals engage in protective and risky health behaviours. Understanding behavioural determinants can inform strategies to promote behaviour change and using a theory-driven approach underpinned by behavioural science, facilitates a more detailed understanding of mechanisms of change. Evidence indicates some minority ethnic groups have lower intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This is of considerable concern given higher COVID-19 incidence, morbidity, and mortality among minority ethnic groups. There is limited evidence of the reasons underpinning vaccine hesitancy in minority ethnic groups in the UK, but emerging evidence indicates it is related to beliefs about vaccine safety/efficacy and issues of mistrust towards formal services, as well as practical barriers such as access. This study will involve three waves of in-depth interviews and focus groups with minority ethnic community members and organisations in London and Birmingham to understand (i) specific barriers and facilitators of vaccine uptake, (ii) changes in COVID-19 vaccination risk perceptions over time, (iii) challenges and strategies for building and sustaining community support for vaccination programmes, and (iv) the impact of public health campaigns on vaccination intention.
