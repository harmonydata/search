12:T8f5,The Unrepresented Worker Survey, 2001-2004 surveyed a random sample of 501 workers earning median wage or below, who had experienced a job-related 'problem' within the past three years (2001-2004), when they were not members of a trade union. The survey is regionally representative of Great Britain, but quotas were not set, since there is no known sampling frame within the required criteria.

Further information may be found on the Working Lives Research Institute's Unorganised Workers web page.

 The questionnaire covered ten potential job-related problems that respondents may have experienced at work during the three years prior to the survey, concerning:pay (not being paid the correct amount, not being paid regularly, not receiving pay for holidays or overtime, etc.)job security (fear of unfair dismissal, or being forced to resign)lack of opportunitiesdiscriminationdifficulties experienced when requiring time off workworking hoursworkloadhealth and safetyconcerns related to contract or job descriptionother workplace problems, such as stress or bullyingInformation was also gathered on responses to these problems, including:what, if anything, was done to resolve the problemwhat action was taken, or if not, reasons whyfrom whom any advice was soughtwhat the final outcome waswhether problems were shared with a group or workers and if so, whether collective action was taken, and what the outcomes wereRespondents' views on worker representation were also sought, including whether they thought a trade union would have helped resolve the matter, whether they would join one, and their general views on trade unionism.

Demographic details gathered from respondents included gender, ethnicity, disability, age, previous union membership and current membership, and language. Details of respondents' workplace and employment background were also collected, including sector, occupation, workplace size, whether the organisation had formal grievance procedures and/or a management consultation body, hours worked, whether the respondent was a permanent or temporary worker, length of service, pay (calculated hourly), gender and ethnic background of fellow workers, whether respondents worked alone or as part of a group, and whether they worked in one or several workplaces.13:T8f5,The Unrepresented Worker Survey, 2001-2004 surveyed a random sample of 501 workers earning median wage or below, who had experienced a job-related 'problem' within the past three years (2001-2004), when they were not members of a trade union.
