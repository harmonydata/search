12:T5ce,This Unrestricted Access Teaching Dataset is based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW), 2013-2014. It has been prepared for teaching and student use only with the aim of helping class tutors incorporate empirical data into their courses and supporting students to develop skills in quantitative data analysis. It contains data for 8,843 cases from the CSEW 2013-14 (non-victim form dataset) for a small selection of variables.

Most variables come directly from the CSEW 2013-14. However, some variables have been recoded and additional scalar variables have been added to support teaching and learning.

This Teaching Dataset is available under the Open Government Licence.

 The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) is a face-to-face victimisation survey in which people resident in households in England and Wales are asked about their experiences of a range of crimes in the 12 months prior to the interview. Respondents to the survey are also asked about their perceptions of crime and attitudes towards crime related issues such as the police and criminal justice system. 

This dataset contains 32 variables, covering the following topics:   
demographic details
perceptions of crime module
experience of crime 
antisocial behaviour 

All the variables within the dataset are individual level variables and require individual based analysis. There is a mix of discrete and continuous variables. 

Further details of the variables are provided in the User Guide.13:T5ce,This Unrestricted Access Teaching Dataset is based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW), 2013-2014.
