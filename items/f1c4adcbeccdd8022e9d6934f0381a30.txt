12:Tc65,The main method of data collection was semi-structured interviews, mostly conducted online. We interviewed experts (ESOL providers, decision- makers – 14), teachers and community-based practitioners (17) and learners (22). In addition to interviews, we also conducted participant observation in language cafés and classes organised by  different third sector providers in Aberdeen city. The research questions underpinning the project were:
RQ1: How do geographic location and changes in ESOL governance shape the complex landscape of ESOL provision in Scotland?
RQ2: How well do policy frameworks, funding priorities and expected outcomes align with the experiences and understandings of ESOL providers and learners?
RQ3: What is language learning for and about, and how does it relate to ‘integration’? 
RQ4: Who is considered in need of language learning and/or integrating?
The project report includes a full discussion of the methodology, key findings and recommendations. It is available at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7885964This dataset comes from research project ‘Language learning and migrant 'integration' in Scotland: exploring infrastructure, provision and experiences’ (2019-23). The project focuses on ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages), defined as English language education for adult learners aged 16+, although we also explore initiatives not branded as ESOL but related to language learning and/or migrants’ socio-cultural integration. Political and policy discourses often posit the acquisition of English as playing a key role in migrants’ successful integration (Cooke and Simpson 2009); yet language learning can be awkwardly positioned between different understandings of the purposes and meanings of ‘integration’, a contested concept that has been exposed to extensive critique (Saharso 2019). 
In this qualitative study, we explored the complex landscape of ESOL provision in Scotland through a comparison between Glasgow, Aberdeen city and Aberdeenshire, and considered the perspectives of diverse ESOL providers, decision-makers, practitioners and learners. The research took place at a time when ESOL provision in Scotland was undergoing significant changes in terms of governance, funding and organisation of provision.
