12:Teee,The five surveys in this group comprise a comparative study in local government of the cities of Glasgow and Belfast.
The purpose of the study was to devise and test a comprehensive framework which draws together the results of previous findings and theory, within which the effects of political stratification can be investigated. Also to investigate correlates of political stability by comparing Belfast (unstable) with Glasgow (stable).
With the obvious modifications (e.g. geographical, political party title, public office title, local issue reference etc.), the survey design used for the Belfast surveys is the same as that used for the Glasgow surveys. Details of variations in approach and scrutiny may be found in Appendix 1 of I Budge and C O'Leary, <i>Belfast: an approach to crisis</i>.  Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
Data include party affiliation, initial political involvement, length of time spent in active politics, offices held in party, public offices held, perception of the role of present office, perceived satisfactions and rewards of average party worker from political activities (also whether he considers that the kinds of rewards differ for workers in other parties) and repondent's general impression of local political parties. Information on respondent's party work includes the sort of advice or help given to people in wards outside an election period and whether any resolutions sent to his party association. Also, respondent's knowledge of the councillors for his ward and contact with them are noted.
Data concerning Glasgow affairs include respondent's opinion of the most important problems facing Glasgow Corporation and what he would like to see done (strength of feeling is noted), which party respondent feels would take the course of action he believes necessary and his awareness of the consensus of public opinion on these matters. The respondent's sense of political efficacy is assessed and he is asked whether he thinks any problem might be worsened by public exposure. As in SN:6035 he is asked for suggestions concerning changes in the running of local government in Glasgow, whether the elimination of parties on Glasgow Corporation would alter its functioning, what he believes to be the role of pressure groups (and of the Lord Provost) in Glasgow politics and for whom he would vote if no candidate from the Progressive or Labour Parties stood for election. Finally, his affinity to the city is recorded.
As in SN:66035 and SN:66036, the following topical issues are specifically considered: the proposal to have pubs in Corporation housing estates, the elimination of fees in Corporation schools, extending parking meters in the City centre, the increase in rates. These issues are considered in terms of the flow of information received, personal opinion, official opinion of any organisation (apart from party) to which respondent belongs (e.g. trade union, church etc.), perception of public opinion in the ward and of the opinions of ward councillors, knowledge of official views of each party. Respondent reference groups are noted together with his sources of information for constituent opinion. In addition preferences on integration in schools are ascertained.
More general information includes newspaper readership and exposure to the mass media (considering in particular the respondent's sources of information about current national and local affairs). As in 66035, 66036, the respondent's perception of class and religion is assessed.
Background Variables
Sex, age, race, marital status, age when full-time education ceased, occupation, social class, father's occupation, father's political party identification, trade union or professional association membership, religious denomination, whether respondent has any relatives active in politics.13:Teee,The five surveys in this group comprise a comparative study in local government of the cities of Glasgow and Belfast.
