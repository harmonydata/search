[5] Conclusions and Output Reports
Files: 19
The files cover presentations presented at different forums during the course of the PhD work about findings from the project. Also included is a radiological assessment report submitted to the Environment Agency after the initial radiological assessment of the site discharges. There are various power-point presentations made on completion of the PhD work. Another set of files cover the reports submitted by CERC, Cambridge, that were referenced in the first published paper cited in the PhD thesis. The folder includes the final PhD thesis after corrections and award.This work treats very short-range atmospheric dispersion of radioactive gases emitted from stacks just above the roof level of buildings and develops a methodology that provides realistic radiation dose estimates for that zone. Fluid flow in the rooftop region is complex, and the concentration field resulting from an emission into that flow also exhibits high levels of complexity, beyond the capability of existing operational dispersion models. Extensive Laser Doppler anemometry measurements were made in a meteorological wind tunnel to characterise the flow field in this region. Concentration fields were mapped with fast flame ionisation detectors and related to the associated flow characteristics. Parameters investigated were release position, release height, angle of approach flow and building geometry, the latter to contrast behaviour at a real site with that above a standard cuboid building (as would be used in operational dispersion models); sensitivity to surrounding buildings was also investigated. Methods were developed using Monte Carlo techniques to convert the complex spatial distribution of radioactive pollutant in the roof zone into accurate estimates of radiation doses received by persons in that zone. Effective dose estimates accounted for inhalation, immersion and external gamma-rays from the mixed positron/gamma-ray field – including doses within the radioactive plume at roof level. Short duration releases were covered as well as continuous releases. Novel methods are presented to specify the statistical confidence interval from different duration releases in terms of readily generalisable results. Full-scale measurements of gamma ray dose, wind speed and direction were made for one of the building cases and the results used to support the findings obtained by wind tunnel measurements and Monte Carlo calculations. Results are presented in generalisable form, for example as dimensionless concentrations, so that the methods and results can be applied to other similar types of pollutant release.13:T1b9c,The data files are separated into the following categories.

Short duration releases were covered as well as continuous releases. Novel methods are presented to specify the statistical confidence interval from different duration releases in terms of readily generalisable results. Full-scale measurements of gamma ray dose, wind speed and direction were made for one of the building cases and the results used to support the findings obtained by wind tunnel measurements and Monte Carlo calculations. Results are presented in generalisable form, for example as dimensionless concentrations, so that the methods and results can be applied to other similar types of pollutant release.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Atmospheric Dispersion of Radioactive Gaseous Discharges in the Near Field of Buildings, 2014-2020"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$12"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Atmospheric Dispersion of Radioactive Gaseous Discharges in the Near Field of Buildings, 2014-2020"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$13"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/f32a58c571ec6ba1df7cc04c4feaca8d"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Atmospheric Dispersion of Radioactive Gaseous Discharges in the Near Field of Buildings, 2014-2020"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Atmospheric Dispersion of Radioactive Gaseous Discharges in the Near Field of Buildings, 2014-2020"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$14"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
