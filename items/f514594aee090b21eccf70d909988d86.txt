12:Te89,The Taking Part survey collects data on many aspects of leisure, culture and sport in England, as well as an in-depth range of socio-demographic information on respondents. The survey is commissioned by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in partnership with three of its non-departmental public bodies (Sport England, Arts Council England and English Heritage). The survey was first commissioned in 2005 as a face-to-face household survey of adults (16+) in England. Since then it has run annually and has also been developed to include further elements, including a child element and a longitudinal element.

Important note for users of the 2009-2010 child dataset

The data provided covers both the Year 4 (2008-2009) and the Year 5 (2009-2010) child survey, due to the small number of children sampled in Year 5. There are two main ways to analyse Year 5 data:If you wish to analyse the Year 5 child data only (this data covers three quarters and 537 individuals), you will need to filter the data accordingly, using the 'cY5filter' variable. This will provide results that are consistent with those published in our August 2010 release. If you wish to analyse a full yearâ€™s worth of data to make child data comparable to the adult data, you will need to analyse the three quarters of data for Year 5 and the last quarter of data for Year 4 (i.e. quarters 4-7), using the 'cQ4Q7filter' variable. This data will cover 1,283 individuals.Background to the 2009-2010 survey

Taking Part, 2009-2010, also known as Year 5 of the continuous survey, includes 6,097 interviews conducted with adults (aged 16 or over) and 3,159 child interviews (1,350 of these were conducted with children aged 11-15 and 1,809 of these were conducted with a relevant adult who provided information about a child aged 5-10).

The survey used face-to-face computer assisted personal interviews, which on average took 20-25 minutes for adults and 11-15 year old children, and 10-15 minutes for 5-10 year old children to complete. Interviews for 11-15 year olds were carried out directly, whilst 5-10 year olds were interviewed by proxy via the adult respondent.  The sample for this survey had been randomly selected from the small-users postcode address file and only those from private households in England were included. No geographical restrictions were placed on the location of the engagement, although it must have been for the purpose of recreation or leisure (not for paid work), including voluntary work. Children aged 5-10 were asked only about activity that took place out of school, whilst children aged 11-15 were asked about their in and out of school activity.


This study is subject to restrictive Special Licence (SL) access conditions as it contains additional detailed geographic variables (Local Authorities; ACORN Group; ACORN Category; ONS Urban Rural Classification). The End User Licence (EUL) version which is the same, but excludes these detailed variables, is available from the UK Data Service under SN 6579. Users are advised to first obtain the standard EUL version of the data to see if they are sufficient for their research requirements. The SL data have more restrictive access conditions; prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version.

 Main topics covered by the survey include: the arts, museums and galleries, libraries, archives, heritage, sport, social capital, gambling, the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and demographics.13:Te89,The Taking Part survey collects data on many aspects of leisure, culture and sport in England, as well as an in-depth range of socio-demographic information on respondents.
