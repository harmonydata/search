The research explored how violence and civil conflict impinge on and transform the organisation and meaning of non-governmental action, from a perspective grounded in the everyday world of NGO workers. Focusing on development NGOs in Nepal at a time of considerable political turmoil, it described and analysed the impact of violence and conflict on the experience of NGO workers, and on everyday practices in the NGO setting.

1. How have NGO workers at different levels experienced the conflict?
2. What strategies have organisational actors developed at individual and institutional level in response?
3. How have the experience of conflict and individual and institutional responses to it transformed the nature and meaning of NGO work and activity?
