12:Tafb,The UK censuses took place onÂ 21st April 1991. They were run by the Census Office for Northern Ireland, General Register Office for Scotland, and the Office of Population and Surveys for both England and Wales. The UK comprises the countries of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.Statistics from the UK censuses help paint a picture of the nation and how we live. They provide a detailed snapshot of the population and its characteristics, and underpin funding allocation to provide public services. The 1991 Household Sample of Anonymised Records for Great Britain (SARs) is a 1% sample of households and all individuals in those households in Great Britain. It is a hierarchical file allowing linkages between individuals. The geographical base of the 1991 Household SAR is the Registrar General's Standard Regions (the South East is split into Inner and Outer London and the remainder of the South East). The SARs were drawn from the fully coded set of Census records returned by households and institutions. They therefore omit wholly imputed households and also households that were missed by the Census.

The 1991 Household SAR contains 67 variables, similar to those in the Individual file (held under SN 7210). However, the structure of the file allows a large number of other variables to be derived. Many new variables have been created for the hierarchical household file since summary information about a household can be computed from data about the individuals in that household. 

Both 1991 SARs, Household and Individual, were selected from the 10% sample of the 1991 Census. The 1991 Household SAR was selected first. Households were ordered geographically by county and enumeration district in England and Wales, by region and output area in Scotland. They were then grouped into ten households at a time and one household was selected at random from each group. The sampled records were then scrambled to prevent geographical tracing within a SAR area.

The 1991 Household SAR approximates to a simple stratified random sample of households, although counts of individuals in the household file are subject to the effects of clustering.

Further information, including guides and other documentation, may be found on the Cathie Marsh Centre for Survey Research Samples of Anonymised Records website.

 Variables included in the 1991 Household SAR are(for entire or household/individual members):  age, sex, marital status, employment status, occupation, industry, social class, accommodation, bath/shower and indoor toilet facilities, tenure, economic position and social class of family head; number of pensioners/students/sick persons/persons with long-term illness/economically active and inactive/retired/employed and unemployed/under 16-year-olds/dependants in the household.13:Tafb,The UK censuses took place onÂ 21st April 1991.
