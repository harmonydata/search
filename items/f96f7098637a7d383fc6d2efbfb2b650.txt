12:T4bd,The research in Entebbe, Uganda, will analyse the experiences of people living with HIV following access to life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART). The study aims to understand how people have responded to a new chance at life, what factors enable people to adjust to living with HIV as a chronic condition, and what support measures affect this adjustment. The study aims to inform ART delivery policy and practice in resource-constrained settings. 
Adjustment to a new life on ART poses medical, social and economic challenges, especially in settings of poverty. People must take treatment for the rest of their lives, and they are usually recovering after a period of serious illness and disruption to their social and economic lives. 
Three ART delivery sites with different modes of delivery and support will be compared. A quasi-experimental research design will be used to compare people affected and unaffected by HIV and ART, and uses complementary qualitative and quantitative methods.
The research involved collaboration between four partners: The School of International Development at UEA, and in Uganda the Medical Research Council, The AIDS Support Organisation and a Ministry of Health hospital.13:T4bd,The research in Entebbe, Uganda, will analyse the experiences of people living with HIV following access to life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART).
