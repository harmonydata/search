2)	To identify critical governance interventions that are required to support transformative policy change towards low carbon mobility. Providing support to key stakeholders.

The findings identify the role multilevel governance plays in influencing local level policy responses towards low carbon mobility. In doing so, the project provides insights into the ways current UK governance arrangements can be supported to enable more effective local policy responses towards low carbon mobility.Urgent and significant change in transport policy is required if the UK wants to meet its net-zero ambitions. This project uses interpretive network and problem analysis to identify the role multi-level governance plays in influencing local-level policy responses towards low carbon mobility.

The project compares the multi-level governance of two city regions in England, UK: Birmingham and Cambridge, using original data collected through participatory mapping workshops and semi-structured interviews. In doing so, the project will provide important and timely recommendations for ways current UK governance arrangements can be supported to enable more effective local policy responses towards low carbon mobility.

The research addresses four key questions:
1)	Who are the most important actors in multi-level governance networks for enabling low carbon mobility?
2)	How do UK multi-level governance networks facilitate or constrain policy responses to low carbon mobility?
3)	How do actors, embedded in UK multi-level governance contexts, interpret the nature of the low carbon mobility challenge?
4)	In what ways can multi-level governance networks be supported to enable transformative policy change towards low carbon mobility?10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Facilitating Policy Change for Low Carbon Mobility: Comparative Analysis of Two City Regions in England, UK (Birmingham and Cambridge), 2021"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Facilitating Policy Change for Low Carbon Mobility: Comparative Analysis of Two City Regions in England, UK (Birmingham and Cambridge), 2021"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/facilitating-policy-change-for-low-carbon-mobility-comparative-analysis-of-two-city-regions-in-england-uk-birmingham-and-cambridge-2021"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Facilitating Policy Change for Low Carbon Mobility: Comparative Analysis of Two City Regions in England, UK (Birmingham and Cambridge), 2021"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Facilitating Policy Change for Low Carbon Mobility: Comparative Analysis of Two City Regions in England, UK (Birmingham and Cambridge), 2021"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
