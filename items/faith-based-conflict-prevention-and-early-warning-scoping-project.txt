Field research in Solomon Islands took place in the capital Honiara.

1) what is distinctive about faith-based approaches and what makes them different from the activities that are carried out by people who are not working from a faith point of view

2) what are the dilemmas that emerge when faith groups get involved in trying the prevent violence and what possible tensions can we foresee with people who do not share their beliefs

 3) what scope is there for improving the work that churches and faith groups do to help prevent violence and what changes do we need to make for this to happen.
