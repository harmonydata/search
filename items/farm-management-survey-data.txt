In particular we were keen to discuss our findings with rural historians, focusing on but not restricting ourselves to individuals and groups in the area studied, and to this end we undertook engagement with publics including relevant societies and other organisations, and this engagement conintues. Crucially, the PI and Co-Is lead numerous other funded research projects and the findings and knowledge gained from this project help to set the context for and feed into each of those. The policy work of the PI in particular is informed by broad historical contexts and knowledge about the implementation of and response to technological change provided by work on this project is vital in this regard.1a:Ted7,The SPSS data file (RES-062-23-1831 FBS data for ESRC archive.sav) contains 215 variables entered either directly from Farm Management Survey (FMS) Field Books or derived from calculations using field book data and supplementary information (such as price indices).  The file ‘RES-062-23-1831 SPSS data handbook.xlsx’ lists all of the variables (both in alphabetical order and the order they appear in in the SPSS file) and includes additional explanatory notes for each variable. Data cleaning was undertaken by looking for logically inconsistent relationships between various variables, querying and checking of anomalous results during data analysis and double checking a number of entries with the original field books. 
The data file contains information on 168 farm holdings in Devon, Dorset and Cornwall from 1939 to 1984. The file contains 4,987 cases. Each case in the SPSS file relates to a specific field book for a specific year for a particular farm. The 168 farms selected for inclusion in the SPSS dataset represent a proportion of all of the farms in the University of Exeter FMS archive. Farms were purposively selected, initially on grounds of longevity in the FMS sample and then to achieve coverage of a cross-section of farming situations in the counties of Devon, Dorset and Cornwall.

The objectives of this project were to produce a detailed survey of agricultural change, and technical change in particular, over the period 1935 – 1985, and to shed light on how and when changes on individual farms were brought about. These objectives were realised, as detailed in the project end of award report. We should note that there was no requirement at the time of the awarding of the grant to produce a pathways to impact plan, and impact beyond these objectives was not the central focus of the project. As an historical project its impact beyond its contribution to the field of knowledge in this area was always bound to be limited. We did, however, identify groups of beneficiaries and we have worked to engage with these audiences to discuss our findings and to broaden knowledge and cultural understanding, and this work is outlined below.
