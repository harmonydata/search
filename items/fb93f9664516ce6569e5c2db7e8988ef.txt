12:T529,This study explores how religious identity interplays with other forms and contexts of identity, specifically those related to sexuality. It investigates at what points - and why - religious and sexual identities are rendered more or less salient in the everyday experiences, choices and identities of queer youth (16-24 yrs) involved in the Metropolitan Community Church (MCC).
This is situated as a specific case-study exploration of Christianity and sexuality in young people's lives asking: how does participation shape identifications, how is marginalisation or discrimination managed and how might religion and sexuality serve as a vehicle for various forms of belonging, identification and political expression? 
It adopts an intersectional lens, both theoretically and methodologically, uncovering the salience of other social divisions and identities in young people's lives. Using such a model is relevant and ambitious, where theorisation has yet to be fully embedded within empirical study. 
Methodologically the project is innovative and sensitive to 'blended' identities and their sophisticated enactment. Qualitative methodology will be deployed informed by a mix of techniques (interviews, maps and diaries) in order to collect rich insights into the everyday lives, practices and identities of MCC youth.13:T529,This study explores how religious identity interplays with other forms and contexts of identity, specifically those related to sexuality.
