Six of these eight surveys are the main study which was carried out on (a) the schools and the fifth-formers and the sixth-formers in them, and (b) the colleges of further education and their home students studying `A&#x27; level subjects full-time.
The material from the young people includes that given by them at two stages, first from the main survey which took place before they sat GCE examinations and before the results of higher education applications were available and secondly, from the follow-up survey after the results of the GCE examinations were known and the young people already embarked on courses the following session. For the fifth and sixth-form surveys (67001, 67002 and 68005) there is also incorporated the form teachers&#x27; broad assessment of ability (three categories) examination prospects and higher education and career aspirations. For the schools the main survey was carried out in the Spring term 1967 with the follow-up in the autumn. The equivalent dates in the colleges of further education were May 1967 and January 1968.
(The remaining two surveys are subsidiary to the project; 66023 is the pilot stage of the main survey part of 68004, i.e. home students studying `A&#x27; levels full-time in the further education colleges, whilst 67005 (fifth-formers in the fast stream in schools) comprises a sub-set of material from the main fifth-form survey for an enlarged sample of those pupils in schools with fast streams).
The six surveys in the main study are interlinked with information from the school or college complementing that from the pupil or student. In addition there is standardisation - as far as was practicable - between sections of the questionnaire used for the fifth-formers, lower and upper sixth-formers and students in further education (e.g. general background). The contents of the questionnaire for the upper sixth-formers and further education students corresponded particularly closely. Copies of all reports on the surveys are in the Library of the Royal Statistical Society. Mainly they deal with specific aspects of the data e.g. &#x27;Subject commitments and the demand for higher education&#x27;, G. A. Barnard and M. D. McCreath (1970) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A (General) 133 (3) 358 - 408, &#x27;Report of the surveys of full-time &#x27;A&#x27; level students (home) in colleges of further education&#x27;, by M. D. McCreath (1970). All the material which is available is listed in the most recent report written in 1972, Factors influencing choice of higher education: surveys carried out by Margaret D McCreath under the direction of Professor G A Barnard, Department of Mathematics, University of Essex. This 1972 report includes data from both the school and further education surveys. The extensive tables are based on the following variables: social class, expectations about leaving school and reasons for doing so, source of the most useful discussion on what to do after school, family experience of higher education, `O&#x27; and `A&#x27; level attempts and passes, knowledge of higher education entry requirements and with whom these were discussed, as well as intended and actual destinations in higher education.
The technical note on the sample design by Judith Doherty was published in 1970 as Appendix 1 of Volume 1 of the Schools Council Sixth-Form Survey, Sixth-Form Pupils and Teachers. Details of the response rates are given in the 1972 report mentioned above.  Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
Information given includes: from what source respondent received guidance in choosing GCE &#x27;O&#x27; level subjects to follow (9 categories) and whether this guidance greatly influenced choice, whether favourite subject is also best subject, number of &#x27;O&#x27; levels already passed, number to be attempted this summer (a record of subjects is given together with those that respondent intends to take at &#x27;A&#x27; level), whether respondent is taking any external examinations (i.e. CSE or RSA). What respondent wishes to do when he leaves school, whether he has discussed this seriously with anybody, if so, with whom he has had most useful discussion (4 categories) and whether this discussion was on respondent&#x27;s initiative. When respondent expects to leave school, where he expects to be in the next year (i.e. whether he will be studying full or part-time), if going to study at a college, qualification led to by course to be taken (e.g. GCE &#x27;O&#x27; and/or &#x27;A&#x27; level, City and Guilds etc.), main field of study to be followed (12 categories) reasons for applying for course. Data are also given on where respondent wants to live after leaving school, and if he is to work, whether the job chosen is in the same industry, profession or trade as either parent, and whether respondent&#x27;s choice was influenced by the time it would take to qualify, or by the thought that the respondent could do it either full or part-time after marriage.
A follow-up survey, which is incorporated, was carried out after the summer examination period to discover the actual results achieved by respondents, and their attitudes towards these results and their plans in the light of these results. The study also includes a questionnaire answered by form teachers or house-masters of fifth-form pupils. It requires information on each pupil born on the 5th, 15th and 25th of each month (i.e. for those pupils in the sample of questionnaires which was analysed). It seeks to gain an independent assessment of the pupil&#x27;s scholastic ability, and to gauge the teacher&#x27;s attitude towards the child&#x27;s aspirations.

purpose of this study was to investigate the factors which influence young people in their demand for higher education in its various forms - at universities, colleges of education (teacher training colleges), polytechnics and colleges of further education. Six of these eight surveys are the main study which was carried out on (a) the schools and the fifth-formers and the sixth-formers in them, and (b) the colleges of further education and their home students studying `A' level subjects full-time.\nThe material from the young people includes that given by them at two stages, first from the main survey which took place before they sat GCE examinations and before the results of higher education applications were available and secondly, from the follow-up survey after the results of the GCE examinations were known and the young people already embarked on courses the following session. For the fifth and sixth-form surveys (67001, 67002 and 68005) there is also incorporated the form teachers' broad assessment of ability (three categories) examination prospects and higher education and career aspirations. For the schools the main survey was carried out in the Spring term 1967 with the follow-up in the autumn. The equivalent dates in the colleges of further education were May 1967 and January 1968.\n(The remaining two surveys are subsidiary to the project; 66023 is the pilot stage of the main survey part of 68004, i.e. home students studying `A' levels full-time in the further education colleges, whilst 67005 (fifth-formers in the fast stream in schools) comprises a sub-set of material from the main fifth-form survey for an enlarged sample of those pupils in schools with fast streams).\nThe six surveys in the main study are interlinked with information from the school or college complementing that from the pupil or student. In addition there is standardisation - as far as was practicable - between sections of the questionnaire used for the fifth-formers, lower and upper sixth-formers and students in further education (e.g. general background). The contents of the questionnaire for the upper sixth-formers and further education students corresponded particularly closely.

All the material which is available is listed in the most recent report written in 1972, Factors influencing choice of higher education: surveys carried out by Margaret D McCreath under the direction of Professor G A Barnard, Department of Mathematics, University of Essex. This 1972 report includes data from both the school and further education surveys. The extensive tables are based on the following variables: social class, expectations about leaving school and reasons for doing so, source of the most useful discussion on what to do after school, family experience of higher education, `O' and `A' level attempts and passes, knowledge of higher education entry requirements and with whom these were discussed, as well as intended and actual destinations in higher education.\nThe technical note on the sample design by Judith Doherty was published in 1970 as Appendix 1 of Volume 1 of the Schools Council Sixth-Form Survey, Sixth-Form Pupils and Teachers. Details of the response rates are given in the 1972 report mentioned above.  Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions\nInformation given includes: from what source respondent received guidance in choosing GCE 'O' level subjects to follow (9 categories) and whether this guidance greatly influenced choice, whether favourite subject is also best subject, number of 'O' levels already passed, number to be attempted this summer (a record of subjects is given together with those that respondent intends to take at 'A' level), whether respondent is taking any external examinations (i.e. CSE or RSA). What respondent wishes to do when he leaves school, whether he has discussed this seriously with anybody, if so, with whom he has had most useful discussion (4 categories) and whether this discussion was on respondent's initiative. When respondent expects to leave school, where he expects to be in the next year (i.e. whether he will be studying full or part-time), if going to study at a college, qualification led to by course to be taken (e.g. GCE 'O' and/or 'A' level, City and Guilds etc.), main field of study to be followed (12 categories) reasons for applying for course. Data are also given on where respondent wants to live after leaving school, and if he is to work, whether the job chosen is in the same industry, profession or trade as either parent, and whether respondent's choice was influenced by the time it would take to qualify, or by the thought that the respondent could do it either full or part-time after marriage.\nA follow-up survey, which is incorporated, was carried out after the summer examination period to discover the actual results achieved by respondents, and their attitudes towards these results and their plans in the light of these results. The study also includes a questionnaire answered by form teachers or house-masters of fifth-form pupils. It requires information on each pupil born on the 5th, 15th and 25th of each month (i.e. for those pupils in the sample of questionnaires which was analysed). It seeks to gain an independent assessment of the pupil's scholastic ability, and to gauge the teacher's attitude towards the child's aspirations.\nBackground Variables\nDate of birth, sex, number in family, position of respondent in family, family experience of higher education (full or part-time), occupation of parent(s), length of stay at present school and age on 1st January 1966."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"13:T1790,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors which influence young people in their demand for higher education in its various forms - at universities, colleges of education (teacher training colleges), polytechnics and colleges of further education.

When respondent expects to leave school, where he expects to be in the next year (i.e. whether he will be studying full or part-time), if going to study at a college, qualification led to by course to be taken (e.g. GCE 'O' and/or 'A' level, City and Guilds etc.), main field of study to be followed (12 categories) reasons for applying for course. Data are also given on where respondent wants to live after leaving school, and if he is to work, whether the job chosen is in the same industry, profession or trade as either parent, and whether respondent's choice was influenced by the time it would take to qualify, or by the thought that the respondent could do it either full or part-time after marriage.\nA follow-up survey, which is incorporated, was carried out after the summer examination period to discover the actual results achieved by respondents, and their attitudes towards these results and their plans in the light of these results. The study also includes a questionnaire answered by form teachers or house-masters of fifth-form pupils. It requires information on each pupil born on the 5th, 15th and 25th of each month (i.e. for those pupils in the sample of questionnaires which was analysed). It seeks to gain an independent assessment of the pupil's scholastic ability, and to gauge the teacher's attitude towards the child's aspirations.\nBackground Variables\nDate of birth, sex, number in family, position of respondent in family, family experience of higher education (full or part-time), occupation of parent(s), length of stay at present school and age on 1st January 1966."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Factors Influencing Choice of Higher Education; Fifth Form Survey\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$12\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"Factors Influencing Choice of Higher Education; Fifth Form Survey\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"$13\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/fc172c889108a90da0d2281204445c8f\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:site_name\",\"content\":\"Academic Resource Discovery\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:locale\",\"content\":\"en_US\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:image:width\",\"content\":\"1200\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:image:height\",\"content\":\"630\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"og:image:alt\",\"content\":\"Factors Influencing Choice of Higher Education; Fifth Form Survey\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"website\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary_large_image\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"Factors Influencing Choice of Higher Education; Fifth Form Survey\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$14\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"17\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]]\nc:null\n"])</script></body></html>
