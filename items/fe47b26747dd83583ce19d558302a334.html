In examining how families handle inheritance, the focus is not so much on the property as on the relationships. The process of handling the transmission of property reveals the character and quality of kinship relationships. This research aims to find out how families handle matters concerning inheritance of property in the circumstances of the 1990s. Do people have clear beliefs and expectations about who should inherit, and how assets should be divided? Are these matters discussed openly in families, or alluded to indirectly? Do expectations about inheritance get linked with other responsibilities in families, for example, responsibility for the care of an elderly person?\n\nIn-depth interviews were conducted with members of the public about their views and experiences of inheritance. The aim was to discover how inheritance was negotiated with kin in families that had not held land or considerable property over generations. Interviewees were selected through a form of quota sampling where quotas were defined in 'theoretical' rather than representational terms.
