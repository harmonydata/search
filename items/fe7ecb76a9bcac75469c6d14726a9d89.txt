12:T99e,The European Values Study (EVS) and World Values Survey (WVS) series is designed to enable a cross-national, cross-cultural comparison of values and norms on a wide variety of topics and to monitor changes in values and attitudes across the globe. The WVS is one of the world's most extensive and most widely used social surveys. Since 1981, it has captured the views of almost 400,000 respondents in over 110 countries, covering topics including cultural identity, migration, trust, empathy, tolerance, media consumption, political interest, the environment and more.These surveys show pervasive changes in what people want out of life and what they believe. To monitor these changes, the EVS/WVS has executed seven waves of surveys to date at various times between 1981 and 2022. Representative national samples of each society's public are interviewed using a standardised questionnaire covering various social, economic, cultural and religious topics. The countries included in these surveys cover the full range from very poor countries to very rich ones, from authoritarian systems to liberal democracies, covering all major cultural zones. 
Further information about each survey series can be found on the EVS and WVS websites.
