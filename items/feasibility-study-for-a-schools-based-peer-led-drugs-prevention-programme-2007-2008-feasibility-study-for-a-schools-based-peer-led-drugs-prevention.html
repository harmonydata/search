This project builds on the successful MRC-funded ASSIST (A Stop Smoking in Schools Trial) schools smoking intervention. The project aimed to:develop, pilot, execute and document a drugs-education, peer-supporter training programme to be delivered alongside existing ASSIST peer-supporter trainingto evaluate the feasibility of a future Phase III RCT by conducting a Phase II feasibility study, using a three-arm experimental design with two control schools, two schools receiving the ASSIST intervention, and two further schools receiving ASSIST plus the above drugs education interventiona process evaluation of the impact of the interventionPupil data were collected at baseline, immediately post-intervention and at three month follow-up, in the form of self-report data on smoking and drug use behaviour and intentions. Process data were also collected from trainers, teachers (both qualitative interviews), pupils (survey data) and peer supporters (survey data and focus group data).

Further information is available from the Centre For Drug Misuse Research project webpage.
Quantitative questionnaire survey:

In all six schools quantitative data were collected from all S2 pupils at three time points: immediately prior to the selection and training of the peer supporters (time one), immediately after the end of the ten week intervention period (time two) and finally three months after the end of the intervention period (time three).

The questionnaires covered the following topics: cigarette smoking, and alcohol drinking, drugs, cannabis, friends and family, views on life, smoking and cannabis, education in school, views on the research project, basic demographic information

Qualitative data:

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six trainers and six teachers in secondary schools where the intervention was delivered. The training sessions were evaluated and the impact on pupils discussed.

Focus groups were conducted with peer supporters after the training had been completed. The discussions included the good and bad things about being a peer supporter and general evaluation of the training they had received."/><meta property="og:title" content="Feasibility Study for a Schools-Based, Peer-Led, Drugs Prevention Programme, 2007-2008 / Feasibility Study for a Schools-Based, Peer-Led, Drugs Prevention Programme, Based on the ASSIST Programme"/><meta property="og:description" content="This is a mixed-method data collection.
