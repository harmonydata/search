12:T569,The aim of this research was to survey significant technical innovations (defined as the successful commercial introduction of new or improved products, processes or materials) which have been introduced into British industry and commerce since 1945. The survey was conducted for the purpose of providing information which complements that on other aspects of the nation's scientific and technological activity, and for use as a measurement of the output of innovative activities, indicating the nature of the innovative firms, knowledge inputs, the characteristics of innovations, and the flow between industries. Significant innovations were identified by groups of experts knowledgeable in particular sectors, and their information was confirmed by the innovating firms wherever possible.  The survey contains the following information for each innovation:
(1) a brief description of the innovation;
(2) the industrial sector of the innovation (SIC, ISIC and SITC codes);
(3) the type of innovation (product, process, etc.);
(4) the sources of major knowledge inputs to the innovation;
(5) the dates of introduction of the innovation;
(6) the sector (SIC and ISIC), size, status and name of the innovating firm;
(7) the sector (SIC and ISIC), size, country of origin and name of parent company where appropriate;
(8) the sector (SIC and ISIC) in which the innovation was first used.13:T569,The aim of this research was to survey significant technical innovations (defined as the successful commercial introduction of new or improved products, processes or materials) which have been introduced into British industry and commerce since 1945.
