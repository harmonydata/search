Using the COVID–19 recession in the UK as a case study, we employ weighted linear probability models with 2021 data from the Evidence for Equality National Survey (EVENS) to look at changes in economic indicators across ethnic groups and gender. We report heterogeneity in flexible employment rates within the non-White group and between the non-White and the White British group. By using a conditional decomposition method, we conclude that those ethnic minority groups who were disproportionately on flexible contracts experienced worse economic effects than the White British group.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Flexible Contracts and Ethnic Economic Inequalities Across Gender During the UK's COVID-19 Recession, Evidence for Equality National Survey Analysis Code, 2021"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Flexible Contracts and Ethnic Economic Inequalities Across Gender During the UK's COVID-19 Recession, Evidence for Equality National Survey Analysis Code, 2021"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/flexible-contracts-and-ethnic-economic-inequalities-across-gender-during-the-uk-s-covid-19-recession-evidence-for-equality-national-survey-analysis"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Flexible Contracts and Ethnic Economic Inequalities Across Gender During the UK's COVID-19 Recession, Evidence for Equality National Survey Analysis Code, 2021"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Flexible Contracts and Ethnic Economic Inequalities Across Gender During the UK's COVID-19 Recession, Evidence for Equality National Survey Analysis Code, 2021"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
