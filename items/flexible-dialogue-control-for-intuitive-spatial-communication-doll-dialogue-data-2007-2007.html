This downloadable dialogue corpus allows these issues to be addressed, designed with the following core features that together set it apart from previous data:
a. Naturalistic action related dialogue. Two ‘naïve’ speakers (no confederate) are confronted with a task involving action, to be solved based on verbal interaction.
b. Asymmetric knowledge. Each dialogue involves a ‘director’ and a ‘matcher’. The ‘director’ knows about the specific task goals (here: the target configuration), and informs the ‘matcher’ accordingly.
c. Everyday spatial concepts in a multi-object arrangement context. The task involves placing dolls’ house furniture in a target arrangement, similar to a range of common tasks in everyday life through evoking relevant action scripts and schemata that guide expectations about object location.
d. Experimental variation. Furniture arrangements differ with respect to the functional relationship between objects and therefore in their congruence with context frames, and hence common ground (prior to communication).
e. Operationalized success. Correct object placement informs about communicative success.
f. Task experience. After swapping roles, dialogue partners can build on previous task experience.
