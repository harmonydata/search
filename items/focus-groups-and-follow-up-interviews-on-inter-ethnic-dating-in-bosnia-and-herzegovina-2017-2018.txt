The topic was dating across ethnic lines.  Although billions of pounds internationally have been invested in post-conflict reconciliation projects, primarily involving aspects of justice and the creative arts, there has been no study of this phenomenon as such. To date, only isolated studies of particular places and projects have been undertaken - a lack noted by UNDP (Western Balkans), one of the largest funders of such work, which seeks a 'codified body of knowledge pertaining to reconciliation.' This interdisciplinary project will therefore innovatively investigate post-conflict reconciliation to produce the first overarching study to address this major (practitioner and academic) gap. It will do so by combining history, conflict resolution methodologies, art and creative practice, and both qualitative and quantitative social sciences in three strands: 1. The first historical investigation of the idea and practice of reconciliation through time, involving examples, such as the English Civil War or post-1945 Europe, and also an integrated study of thought (including religious and philosophical) and practice on reconciliation. 2. Interrogation of both the past use of art and related media in reconciliation initiatives and the potential of artistic practices and artefacts to play a role in inter-communal conflict resolution, remembrance, forgetting and forgiving. This will include critical evaluation of data generated by a series of initiatives using visual media to stimulate inter-ethnic dialogue and reconciliation, particularly with youth groups, run by the Post Conflict Research Centre (PCRC) in Bosnia and Hercegovina. 3. Comparative empirical research between institutional domains, across countries and over time of debates on reconciliation, applying innovative computer-assisted quantitative and qualitative analysis to multi-language large text data from the Balkans. This will include a dedicated analysis of RECOM, a unique, locally-driven NGO initiative for reconciliation involving 5,000 civil society members from all countries and ethnic groups in the region, generating large data in various languages that remains both to be analysed and also its potential to inform understanding of reconciliation developed. The three strands will be integrated by: project workshops; a co-authored synthetic book integrating the research and offering an overarching framework of understanding reconciliation; and a common and comprehensive thread, drawing on the particular experience and past research of the applicants.

The research has been developed and discussed with practitioners, including UNDP (Western Balkans) where the absence of an overarching framework for understanding reconciliation was identified and who have been involved in designing the project, the Humanitarian Law Center, Belgrade and the Humanitarian Law Center (Pristina), the PCRC (Sarajevo), and the FCO (the Policy Unit, Research Analysts and the UK UN Mission), all of whom are committed to the project in terms of design, facilitation and evaluation. The project is also supported by the EU DG-Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations, who would benefit by benefit by being better able to assess EU-funded projects and by the Deputy Assistant Secretary General, NATO who would support and facilitate the research and provide channels for possible impact. The research should also be of benefit to post-conflict communities subject to, or involved in, reconciliation processes.10:{"metadata":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Focus groups and follow-up interviews on inter-ethnic dating in Bosnia and Herzegovina 2017-2018"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"$1c"}],"$L1d","$L1e","$L1f","$L20","$L21","$L22","$L23","$L24","$L25","$L26","$L27","$L28","$L29","$L2a","$L2b","$L2c"],"error":null,"digest":"$undefined"}

2d:T109c,A total of 41 participants took part in six focus groups on Facebook. Five of these were held in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a further control group was held in Croatia. 30 women took part and 11 men, aged 18 to 36 (mean age of 24.5). The topic was dating across ethnic lines.  Although billions of pounds internationally have been invested in post-conflict reconciliation projects, primarily involving aspects of justice and the creative arts, there has been no study of this phenomenon as such. To date, only isolated studies of particular places and projects have been undertaken - a lack noted by UNDP (Western Balkans), one of the largest funders of such work, which seeks a 'codified body of knowledge pertaining to reconciliation.' This interdisciplinary project will therefore innovatively investigate post-conflict reconciliation to produce the first overarching study to address this major (practitioner and academic) gap. It will do so by combining history, conflict resolution methodologies, art and creative practice, and both qualitative and quantitative social sciences in three strands: 1. The first historical investigation of the idea and practice of reconciliation through time, involving examples, such as the English Civil War or post-1945 Europe, and also an integrated study of thought (including religious and philosophical) and practice on reconciliation. 2. Interrogation of both the past use of art and related media in reconciliation initiatives and the potential of artistic practices and artefacts to play a role in inter-communal conflict resolution, remembrance, forgetting and forgiving. This will include critical evaluation of data generated by a series of initiatives using visual media to stimulate inter-ethnic dialogue and reconciliation, particularly with youth groups, run by the Post Conflict Research Centre (PCRC) in Bosnia and Hercegovina. 3. Comparative empirical research between institutional domains, across countries and over time of debates on reconciliation, applying innovative computer-assisted quantitative and qualitative analysis to multi-language large text data from the Balkans. This will include a dedicated analysis of RECOM, a unique, locally-driven NGO initiative for reconciliation involving 5,000 civil society members from all countries and ethnic groups in the region, generating large data in various languages that remains both to be analysed and also its potential to inform understanding of reconciliation developed. The three strands will be integrated by: project workshops; a co-authored synthetic book integrating the research and offering an overarching framework of understanding reconciliation; and a common and comprehensive thread, drawing on the particular experience and past research of the applicants. The integrated research will provide a critical body of knowledge pertaining to reconciliation and a framework document for critical evaluation of reconciliation activity co-produced with the FCO.
This novel and pioneering research builds on findings from previous funded research projects: ESRC- and AHRC-funded projects on visual material, conflict and war crimes (Gow; Gow and Kerr); USIP- and Leverhulme-funded projects on transitional justice (Kerr; Gow); and Leverhulme-funded research on the RECOM initiative (Kostovicova).
