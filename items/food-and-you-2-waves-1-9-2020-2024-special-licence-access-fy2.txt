Unlike the previous surveys, as well as the standard End User Licence (EUL) study for Food and You 2 the UKDS also holds additional variables under Special Licence (see SN 8815). Further information may be found on the FSA's Food and You Survey webpage.

Food and You 2, 2020-2025The Food and You 2 survey was conducted using a push-to-web methodology and explored participants’ food-related knowledge, behaviours and attitudes. Push-to-web is a quantitative data collection method in which participants are contacted using an offline means of contact and asked to complete an online survey. In this survey, participants were contacted by letter, with those who chose not to complete the online survey, after the initial reminder, subsequently sent a postal version.Trends dataThe second Food and You 2 trends data provides an overview of
key trends between Wave 1 (July 2020 to October 2020) and Wave 8 (October 2023 to January 2024).Special Licence versionThis study comprises a set of additional variables for Food and You 2, 2020-2023, covering food allergies and related demographics. It is subject to more restrictive Special Licence access conditions than the main Food and You 2 study, held under SN 8814. Users should check whether SN 8814 contains sufficient details for their needs, before considering an application for SN 8815.Latest edition informationFor the 11th edition (June 2025), data and documentation for Wave 9 were added to the study and the trends dataset was updated to include Waves 1-8.

2c:T13ab,The Food and You Surveys (2010-2018), and Food and You 2 (2020- ) are bi-annual, cross-sectional surveys of adults aged 16 years and over living in England, Wales and Northern Ireland,  commissioned by the Food Standards Agency (FSA). Food and You provides data about the prevalence of different attitudes, reported behaviour and knowledge about ways in which food is purchased, stored, prepared and eaten.Food and You, 2010-2018From 2010, Food and You became the FSA’s flagship social survey. In addition, the FSA conducted regular tracking surveys including the bi-annual Public Attitudes Tracker and the annual Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS) Consumer Attitudes Tracker (these studies are not held at UKDS). From Wave 4, Food and You included new questions to cover the affordability of food, choice, security and sustainability.Food and You 2, 2020-In 2018, the FSA’s Advisory Committee for Social Science (ACSS) recommended that Food and You and the Public Attitudes Tracker be replaced with a new ‘push-to-web’ survey, Food and You 2, which was commissioned in 2019 with data collection commencing in July 2020. Due to differences in the survey methodologies, comparisons cannot be made between the earlier Food and You surveys, or the Public Attitudes Tracker, and Food and You 2. Therefore Food and You 2, 2020 is the start of a new data time series. Data will be collected through Food and You 2 on a bi-annual basis. Unlike the previous surveys, as well as the standard End User Licence (EUL) study for Food and You 2 the UKDS also holds additional variables under Special Licence (see SN 8815).
