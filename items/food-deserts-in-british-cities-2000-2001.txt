to provide an evaluation of the nature of 'food deserts' in British cities as a contribution to the social exclusion and health inequalities debates and their policy implications;
to design and conduct, within one strategically chosen area of poor retail access in Leeds, a major 'before/after' (baseline and follow-up) study of the impact of the opening of a large new food store on a group of low-income households.

The study required a major and potentially extremely difficult exercise in social survey research, involving a two-wave food diary/household questionnaire survey, focused on the kind of deprived urban area known to pose enormous problems regarding response and attrition rates for social survey research.

Each wave consisted of:
a seven-day food consumption diary/check list - the respondent completed this but interviewer placed and collected it;
a wide-ranging, interviewer-administered household questionnaire. 

The diary and questionnaire were completed, as in the National Food Survey, by the person primarily responsible for the domestic food arrangements of the household.

Intense efforts were made by the research team to minimize sample attrition between waves of survey and hence reduce attrition bias problems in the subsequent analysis; monetary incentives (in the form of non-food retail shopping vouchers) were structured to maximise recruitment in Wave 1 of the survey, and sustain retention of respondents into Wave 2.
 The data files include data from the food diary and the household questionnaire. Topics covered in the questionnaire include household composition, welfare benefits and income, education and work status, disabilities and long-term health problems, smoking habits, attitudes to healthy eating, food store choice, mode of travel to store, car ownership and access, and perceived constraints on choice of foods bought.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Food Deserts in British Cities, 2000-2001"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Food Deserts in British Cities, 2000-2001"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/food-deserts-in-british-cities-2000-2001"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Food Deserts in British Cities, 2000-2001"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Food Deserts in British Cities, 2000-2001"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
