Targets of 1000 respondents in Wave 1 and 600 in Wave 2 were set, in an attempt to ensure sufficient statistical power for the assessment of dietary change across the survey waves. Intense efforts were made by the research team to minimize sample attrition between waves of survey and hence reduce attrition bias problems in the subsequent analysis; monetary incentives (in the form of non-food retail shopping vouchers) were structured to maximise recruitment in Wave 1 of the survey, and sustain retention of respondents into Wave 2.
 The data files include data from the food diary and the household questionnaire. Topics covered in the questionnaire include household composition, welfare benefits and income, education and work status, disabilities and long-term health problems, smoking habits, attitudes to healthy eating, food store choice, mode of travel to store, car ownership and access, and perceived constraints on choice of foods bought.26:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2a"}]
