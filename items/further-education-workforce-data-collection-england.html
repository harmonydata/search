Only further education providers in England were asked to complete the collection.

This dataset is split into three parts. Researchers will be able to specify to ONS upon application whether they require one or more of the available three
datasets:
1. Further Education workforce: This dataset gives contract, pay and role details for staff members working in further education providers. For teachers working at the provider, it also gives details of the subjects taught and the qualifications of the teacher. Over 180,000 staff members were surveyed. The dataset gives one row per staff member. The response rate from further education providers is &lt;100%.
2. Further Education role vacancies: This dataset gives numbers of teacher vacancies and leader/manager vacancies in further education providers. It also gives details on whether the vacancies have been filled and if the vacancy was difficult to fill.
3. Further Education governor demographics and board vacancies: This dataset gives demographics of governors at General Further Education Colleges and sixth form colleges. It also gives details of whether there are vacancies.

This dataset contains data collected from the further education workforce data collection. Data has been collected from:
- General further education colleges (GFECs)
- Sixth form colleges
- Private sector public funded providers
-Other provider types including other public funded providers.
Approximately 1600 further education providers were asked to complete the census.
The response rate to the collection is 77%.

Data quality note: There have been data quality issues identified with some of the variables. See the data dictionary “additional notes” column for details of issues
identified with a particular variable. Some examples include:
• The response to the collection is 77%. Although this is not a data quality issue in itself, you should be aware that the data set does not contain returns from every further education provider in England.
• Approximately 10% of staff with a Full Time Equivalent (FTE) = 1, have weekly working hours &lt; 35 hours or &gt; 40 hours.
• Some staff with part time working patterns (FTE &lt;= 1) have very high salaries if you attempt to scale their given annual salary back up to FTE = 1.
