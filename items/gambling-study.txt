The overarching objective of the first phase of this research was to place problem gambling in its social context, examining it as a particular phase within broader ‘gambling careers’ which are embedded in social and geographical environments and which change over time. In this context, it focused on key stages of change, such as beginning gambling, moving towards and away from problematic behaviour, and processes of recovery.18:T1283,Data resulting from two ESRC funded projects: Phase 1, Situating Problem Gambling - The Social Context of 'Gambling Careers'; and Phase 2, Understanding Gambling - Impacts and Social Networks across the Lifecourse.

 The study used longitudinal qualitative methods in order to explore change over time. At the beginning of Phase 1 fifty individuals were recruited from a variety of locations across Glasgow (e.g.  gambling venues (casinos, betting shops and bingo halls); treatment agencies, and community venues) and then interviewed three times over a twenty month period. They were divided into three main groups: problem gamblers in contact with treatment services (n=12), problem gamblers not in contact with treatment services (n=21) and regular/heavy recreational, gamblers (n=17). 

Problem gamblers were defined as those scoring three or more on the NODS screen, while recreational gamblers had to play at least once a week to be included in the sample. However, it should be noted that these refer to a respondents status at the time of first interview and so it is important to recognise that these were not entirely discrete groups, and that some participants moved from one group to another during the course of the study as behaviour became more or less problematic, or as individuals entered or left treatment.

The NODS screen was developed in the late 1990s for the National Gambling Impact Study Commission primarily for use in large scale surveys. It is based closely on the DSM-IV screen and had been used in prevalence studies, mainly in the United States (Gerstein et al., 1999). The NODS-CLiP was used to recruit the sample, and among those participants who were selected to take part in the study, the full NODS screen was administered. This allowed for the classification of players into problem and non-problem groups.

The interviews were carried out in various locations: most often respondents’ homes, but also within gambling venues and treatment centres. Interviews were loosely structured by topic guides designed to cover a range of themes and drew on a ‘narrative’ approach, aimed at eliciting participants’ views of their own gambling behaviour and its place in their lives. Phase 2 interviewed the original cohort for a fourth time, as well as members of their social networks including family members and friends. 

The purpose of qualitative research is to explore issues in depth within individual contexts rather than to generate data that can be analysed numerically. Thus, the sample was designed purposively to achieve range and diversity and was not intended to be representative of the wider gambling population. The aim of the interviews was to go beyond the kind of information provided by numbers to explore meanings and themes in a series of rich narrative accounts.

Interviews were digitally recorded and later transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analysed using ‘Framework’, a system of data management which allows for the rigorous analysis of qualitative data, developed by the National Centre for Social Research. Framework is a systematic and transparent method of analysis that ensures thorough and rigorous treatment of the data and reliability in interpreting findings. Using a matrix-based approach to analysis, it allows researchers to synthesise and condense transcripts; to treat cases consistently and allow within- and between-case investigation.Traditionally, studies of gambling have been dominated by psychological and medical perspectives.
