Over more than a decade, the study has collected extensive data on twins and their families, including information on growth patterns, eating behaviors, appetite, and the home environment. This rich dataset allows researchers to explore how early childhood exposures impact long-term health, providing valuable insights into the determinants of obesity and related health issues. The findings from the Gemini study contribute to the development of targeted interventions and policies aimed at promoting healthier growth and preventing obesity from an early age.\"}}]]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Gemini\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"Gemini is a large population-based study of twins designed to investigate the genetic and environmental influences on obesity risk, weight gain, and early growth.
