Sampling adolescent girls and boys aged between 10‐19‐year olds, the quantitative survey follows a global total of 18,000 adolescent girls and boys, and their caregivers and explores the effects that programme have on their lives. This is substantiated by in‐depth qualitative and participatory research with adolescents and their peers. Its policy and legal analysis work stream studies the processes of policy change that influence the investment in and effectiveness of adolescent programming.Further information, including publications, can be found on the Overseas Development Institute GAGE website.  Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence: Ethiopia Round 2, 2019-2020 extends the GAGE quantitative research in Ethiopia for a second round. A sample of nearly 8,600 adolescent boys and girls was sought, including nearly 7,000 adolescents surveyed in an earlier Baseline round (available from the UK Data Archive under SN 8597), as well as approximately 1,600 new adolescents. The main purpose of this survey was to gather information on the lives of Ethiopian adolescents living in urban and rural locations in the Amhara, Oromiya, and Afar regions, and to understand their changing lives and challenges. At the time of data collection, adolescents were primarily aged 12-14 and 17-19. The sample includes both randomly and purposefully sampled adolescents, and their female caregivers were also surveyed where possible. The current data release includes information for the subset of individuals who are not part of an ongoing randomized evaluation of adolescent-centric programming. A total of nearly 5,000 adolescents and their caregivers are included in the current release. 
The Core Respondent (CR) dataset contains data from the survey administered to the CR and covers education, time allocation, paid work, health and nutrition, psychosocial and mental health, mobility and voice, social inclusion, marriage and relationships, financial inclusion and economic empowerment, and information and communication technologies. The Adult Female (AF) dataset contains information on the household, including the household roster, family background, durable goods, dwelling characteristics, access to productive capital, recent positive and negative shocks, and household access to programs and support.  In addition, the AF survey contains detailed information about the AF herself, such as parenting, health and nutrition, attitudes to gender equality, marriage, fertility and social norms."/><meta property="og:title" content="Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence: Ethiopia Round 2, 2019-2020 / GAGE"/><meta property="og:description" content="Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence (GAGE) is a ten-year (2015-2025) research programme, funded by UK Aid from the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), that seeks to combine longitudinal data collection and a mixed-methods approach to understand the lives of adolescents in particularly marginalized regions of the Global South, and to uncover &#x27;what works&#x27; to support the development of their capabilities over the course of the second decade of life, when many of these individuals will go through key transitions such as finishing their education, starting to work, getting married and starting to have children.GAGE undertakes longitudinal research in seven countries in Africa (Ethiopia, Rwanda), Asia (Bangladesh, Nepal) and the Middle East (Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine).

from the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), that seeks to combine longitudinal data collection and a mixed-methods approach to understand the lives of adolescents in particularly marginalized regions of the Global South, and to uncover 'what works' to support the development of their capabilities over the course of the second decade of life, when many of these individuals will go through key transitions such as finishing their education, starting to work, getting married and starting to have children.GAGE undertakes longitudinal research in seven countries in Africa (Ethiopia, Rwanda), Asia (Bangladesh, Nepal) and the Middle East (Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine). Sampling adolescent girls and boys aged between 10‐19‐year olds, the quantitative survey follows a global total of 18,000 adolescent girls and boys, and their caregivers and explores the effects that programme have on their lives. This is substantiated by in‐depth qualitative and participatory research with adolescents and their peers. Its policy and legal analysis work stream studies the processes of policy change that influence the investment in and effectiveness of adolescent programming.Further information, including publications, can be found on the Overseas Development Institute GAGE website.  Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence: Ethiopia Round 2, 2019-2020 extends the GAGE quantitative research in Ethiopia for a second round.

The main purpose of this survey was to gather information on the lives of Ethiopian adolescents living in urban and rural locations in the Amhara, Oromiya, and Afar regions, and to understand their changing lives and challenges. At the time of data collection, adolescents were primarily aged 12-14 and 17-19. The sample includes both randomly and purposefully sampled adolescents, and their female caregivers were also surveyed where possible.
