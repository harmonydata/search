However, they differ in their engagements with global policy transfer, histories of attention to gender. There was thus potential to look at how the cases did and did not vary, and the explanatory weight that could be accorded to local conditions.

Five case studies were conducted in each country: the National Department of Education, South Africa, Ministry of Education in Kenya, a provincial department in each country, a matched school attended by children from a peri-urban community with high levels of poverty, a rural NGO working on education and poverty, and a global NGO engaged with the global policy agenda and local implementation. 
The project aims to examine initiatives which engage with global aspirations to advance gender equality in and through schooling in contexts of poverty.  It looks at how these are understood, who participates in implementation, what meanings of gender, schooling and global relations are negotiated, what constraints are experienced, in what ways these are overcome, and what concerns about global obligations emerge. A key focus is what conditions how global policy goals are interpreted and acted on in different sites. Case study research will be conducted in Kenya and South Africa, two countries where reforming governments have sought to address questions of poverty and gender in the expansion of education provision. In each country data will be collected in five sites: the national Department of Education, a provincial education department, a rural primary school, the offices of a Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) engaging with global education and poverty policy, and an education NGO operating at a local level. The main methods of data collection will be documentary analysis, individual and group interviews, focus group discussions, and observations. Advisory committees in Kenya and South Africa will guide the process of data collection, comment critically on emerging analysis, and give support with dissemination.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Gender, education and global poverty reduction initiatives"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Gender, education and global poverty reduction initiatives"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/gender-education-and-global-poverty-reduction-initiatives"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Gender, education and global poverty reduction initiatives"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Gender, education and global poverty reduction initiatives"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
