This additional information is extracted from the proband’s medical record.

All Rare Disease table names are prefixed with “rare_diseases_”.

Data at the Level of Rare Disease Families:

rare_diseases_family:

Data describing the families of rare disease probands participating in the 100,000 Genomes Project. It includes the family group type, the status of the family’s pre-interpretation clinical review and the settings that were chosen for the interpretation pipeline at the clinical review.

rare_diseases_pedigree:

Data describing the Rare Disease participants, linking pedigrees to probands and their family members.

rare_diseases_pedigree_member:

Data describing the Rare Disease pedigree members, similar to the data about each individual participant in the participant table (common data view, see section 8.2). It may also include additional data, such as the age of onset of predominant clinical features; data on links to other family members; as well as data collected only for Phenotypes.

Data at the Level of Rare Disease Participants.

The data presented in these tables provides information on disease progression and pertinent medical history:

rare_diseases_participant_disease:

Data describing the rare disease participants&#x27; disease type/subtype assigned to them upon enrolment, and the date of diagnosis.

rare_diseases_participant_phenotype:

Data describing the Rare Disease participants’ phenotypes. For each Rare Disease participant in the 100,000 Genomes Project, there are data about whether a phenotypic abnormality as defined by an HPO term is present and what the HPO term is, as well as the age of onset, the severity of manifestation, the spatial pattern in the body and whether it is progressive or not. Please note that these data are only available for a subset of the rare disease participants.

rare_diseases_gen_measurement:

For Rare Disease participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project, this table contains general measurements relevant to the disease, alongside the date that the measurements were taken on. Please note that these data are only available for a subset of the rare disease participants.

rare_diseases_early_childhood_observation:

For Rare Disease participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project, this table contains measurements and milestones provided by the GMCs, related to childhood development. Please note that these data are only available for a subset of the rare disease participants.
