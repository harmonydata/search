The project is being implemented by People in Need (PIN) Nepal and aims to mitigate the risk of early marriage among Out-of-School (OOS) adolescent girls in order to uplift their social status and help them lead healthy, safe, and educated lives. \nThe project works in two districts of province-2, namely Bara and Rautahat. Over the period of four years, the PIN will work with four cohorts and aims to reach 8,500 young married and unmarried OOS girls, 17,000 of their family members, 4,000 in-school girls and 4,000 in-school boys, 400 newly elected local government officials, and community/religious leaders.  The implementation capacity of the project is to work directly with approximately 2125 girls each year (i.e., evaluation for each year will have approximately 2125 MOOS girls). In line with the main objective, the project implemented Community Learning Center (CLC) classes targeting the marginalized OOS girls, to enhance their learning proficiency, eventually preparing their transition into formal schooling. Apart from the learning intervention, the project also is teaching girls life skills that include financial literacy, social skill, and family planning, training school teachers to create a safe learning environment, organizing gender-transformative workshops with in-school adolescents, and training MOOS girls’ families and the local government officials. \nFor Cohort II, a pre-post research design was used unlike for Cohort I where a quasi-experimental research design was used to compare the findings between treatment and control groups.
