The qualitative data collection comprised of Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and Key Informant Interview (KII) with various stakeholders.Aarambha project is funded by the UK AID flagship, Girls’ Education Challenge (GEC) program’s Leave No Girls Behind (LNGB) window. The project is being implemented by People in Need (PIN) Nepal and aims to mitigate the risk of early marriage among Out-of-School (OOS) adolescent girls in order to uplift their social status and help them lead healthy, safe, and educated lives. 
The project works in two districts of province-2, namely Bara and Rautahat. Over the period of four years, the PIN will work with four cohorts and aims to reach 8,500 young married and unmarried OOS girls, 17,000 of their family members, 4,000 in-school girls and 4,000 in-school boys, 400 newly elected local government officials, and community/religious leaders.  The implementation capacity of the project is to work directly with approximately 2125 girls each year (i.e., evaluation for each year will have approximately 2125 MOOS girls). In line with the main objective, the project implemented Community Learning Center (CLC) classes targeting the marginalized OOS girls, to enhance their learning proficiency, eventually preparing their transition into formal schooling. Apart from the learning intervention, the project also is teaching girls life skills that include financial literacy, social skill, and family planning, training school teachers to create a safe learning environment, organizing gender-transformative workshops with in-school adolescents, and training MOOS girls’ families and the local government officials. 
For Cohort II, a pre-post research design was used unlike for Cohort I where a quasi-experimental research design was used to compare the findings between treatment and control groups. Although there is a difference in regards to population and research design in Cohort II, the findings from both cohorts are similar. Barriers such as poor household, unsupportive parents, repressive parental attitude existed in cohort II as well which refrained girls from accessing education.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Girls' Survey and Household Survey for Baseline Evaluation of Aarambha Project Cohort I, 2021"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Girls' Survey and Household Survey for Baseline Evaluation of Aarambha Project Cohort I, 2021"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/girls-survey-and-household-survey-for-baseline-evaluation-of-aarambha-project-cohort-i-2021"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Girls' Survey and Household Survey for Baseline Evaluation of Aarambha Project Cohort I, 2021"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Girls' Survey and Household Survey for Baseline Evaluation of Aarambha Project Cohort I, 2021"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
