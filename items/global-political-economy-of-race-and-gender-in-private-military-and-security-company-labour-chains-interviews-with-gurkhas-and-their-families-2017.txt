Taking on roles of consultancy to armed contracting these companies are altering how war and security is practiced. The economic scale of their operations is also noteworthy. These companies are apart of a multibillion dollar industry that is involved in international security operations in, for example, Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya as well as in prisons in the UK and the US. Their clients include the private commercial sector, government bodies and non government organisations. The growth of their operations is matched by a plethora of academic inquiries and journalist reports, which have demonstrated the ways in which these companies are changing security-from a state driven practice to a shared assemblage with private companies, and the associated legal and practical issues. Yet connecting PMSC to political economy of labour has been so far absent. Such a gap misses the significant ways in which these companies are changing how global labour is being organised in preparation for and support of security operations. It also misses the ways in which global South labourers are increasingly called upon to not only provide armed and unarmed security protection, but to conduct the necessary logistics roles that support such operations. \nThis study seeks to address this empirical and theoretical gap in research on private security. It asks: 1) How are the recruitment and management practices of security chains in Qatar informed by race and gender relations? 2) How does race and gender shape the migrant and their families' experiences? and, 3) What are the coping strategies migrant communities and their families adopt and how can they inform corporate social responsibility (CSR) in labour recruitment companies and government policies on labour management? \nIt is an ambitious and timely research project that works directly with two international recruitment and labour management companies that recruit on behalf of PMSCs and other international commercial entities. It compares two Nepalese labour chains that support PMSCs' global operations; the security and logistics labour chains that are being recruited for work in Qatar. Qatar and Nepal are both important countries to study. Qatar, a small Gulf State with large scale development plans and the host of the upcoming 2022 World Cup, relies heavily upon foreign labour to meet its logistics and security needs. Nepal, is a country that has 200 years of foreign migration history and exporting its population for work abroad is a key economic development strategy. By working directly with the migrants, their families, the recruitment companies, government bodies and the \"end users\" of the logistics and security services, this study will gain a sophisticated and holistic insight into how security and logistics labour is constructed and sustained and where best practices are located. \nPlanned outputs include both academic and nonacademic deliverables.

Non-academic deliverables include 1 toolkit aimed at commercial and government users of foreign labour to identify better auditing mechanisms, 1 toolkit aimed at migrants and their families to promote informed decisions in which companies to work with and which recruitment agencies to go through, 1 ethical recruitment accreditation document to be built into Qatar's tender processes, 3 professional podcasts on migrant labour from perspectives of the migrants, the recruitment agencies and government to be used as a teaching tool in universities and commercial social marketing, 1 short animation on migrant labour to be used as a teaching tool for migrant communities and in universities.13:{"metadata":[["$","title","0",{"children":"The Global Political Economy of Race and Gender in Private Military and Security Company Labour Chains: Interviews with Gurkhas and Their Families, 2017"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"$1d"}],"$L1e","$L1f","$L20","$L21","$L22","$L23","$L24","$L25","$L26","$L27","$L28","$L29","$L2a","$L2b","$L2c","$L2d"],"error":null,"digest":"$undefined"}

2e:T13b3,This dataset is from detailed ethnographic semi-structured interviews I conducted with Gurkhas wives, whose husbands now work in the private security industry.  The interviews took place throughout Nepal and the main objective was to glean insight into their everyday lives, how they experience the security industry as the wives who support their husbands and to better account for all the emotional and reproductive labour they do.   

At times the husbands were present during the interviews and sometimes children.  The main focus of these interviews were on the wives though.  I have protected their identities by using alternative names and at times not disclosing where in Nepal the interviews took place.  

The interviews took place in 2017 between April and September.  The transcripts uploaded are the only ones that I was given explicit consent to share publicly via open access, the but issues and themes raises are reflective of all the interviews I conducted with wives of armed and unarmed security contractors coming from Nepal for work in Afghanistan and throughout the Gulf.Private Military and Security Companies (PMSCs) are having a profound impact on the ways in which security governance is organised globally. Taking on roles of consultancy to armed contracting these companies are altering how war and security is practiced. The economic scale of their operations is also noteworthy. These companies are apart of a multibillion dollar industry that is involved in international security operations in, for example, Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya as well as in prisons in the UK and the US. Their clients include the private commercial sector, government bodies and non government organisations. The growth of their operations is matched by a plethora of academic inquiries and journalist reports, which have demonstrated the ways in which these companies are changing security-from a state driven practice to a shared assemblage with private companies, and the associated legal and practical issues. Yet connecting PMSC to political economy of labour has been so far absent. Such a gap misses the significant ways in which these companies are changing how global labour is being organised in preparation for and support of security operations. It also misses the ways in which global South labourers are increasingly called upon to not only provide armed and unarmed security protection, but to conduct the necessary logistics roles that support such operations. 
This study seeks to address this empirical and theoretical gap in research on private security. It asks: 1) How are the recruitment and management practices of security chains in Qatar informed by race and gender relations? 2) How does race and gender shape the migrant and their families' experiences? and, 3) What are the coping strategies migrant communities and their families adopt and how can they inform corporate social responsibility (CSR) in labour recruitment companies and government policies on labour management? 
It is an ambitious and timely research project that works directly with two international recruitment and labour management companies that recruit on behalf of PMSCs and other international commercial entities. It compares two Nepalese labour chains that support PMSCs' global operations; the security and logistics labour chains that are being recruited for work in Qatar. Qatar and Nepal are both important countries to study. Qatar, a small Gulf State with large scale development plans and the host of the upcoming 2022 World Cup, relies heavily upon foreign labour to meet its logistics and security needs. Nepal, is a country that has 200 years of foreign migration history and exporting its population for work abroad is a key economic development strategy. By working directly with the migrants, their families, the recruitment companies, government bodies and the "end users" of the logistics and security services, this study will gain a sophisticated and holistic insight into how security and logistics labour is constructed and sustained and where best practices are located.
