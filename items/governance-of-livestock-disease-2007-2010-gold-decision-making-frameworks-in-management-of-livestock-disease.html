The study is part of the Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme.
The Governance of Livestock Disease (GoLD) project ran from November 2007 to November 2010. The overall aim of the project was to develop an interdisciplinary framework to elucidate the governance of livestock diseases (i.e. the reciprocal impacts of dynamic changes to epidemiology, policy, law and economy) in order to better inform stakeholders of the potential impact of different policy and regulatory changes. Two kinds of data (referred to as &#x27;datasets&#x27; below, some of which had been collected under earlier grants) were used to complete this work and both are available from the UK Data Archive within this study:Dataset 1: questionnaire data were collected from 148 farmers and serum samples were collected from all cattle in a subset of 114 farms. Data collection was funded by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) project SE3026, Bovine TB Transmission in Restocked Herds: Risk Factors and Dynamics, conducted between June 2002 and March 2006. The serum samples were subsequently analysed for antibodies to five endemic diseases in the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) project BBS/B/04854 Epidemiology and Transmission Dynamics of Endemic Infectious Disease in the British Cattle Population, conducted between October 2004 and February 2008. The relational database includes both the questionnaire data and the quantitative serological data.Dataset 2: within the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) RELU funded grant Decision-making Frameworks in Management of Livestock disease: Interaction of Epidemiology, Economics and Politics, which ran from November 2007 to November 2010, the project team conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 farmers concentrating on their attitudes to endemic disease, information sources and relationship with their veterinarian.The farmer interviews covered: background and details about farm; general cattle disease on the farm; six specific cattle diseases: bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVD), Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), bovine tuberculosis (TB), Leptospira, Neospora and Johnes disease; control of disease; cattle in and out of the herd; neighbouring farms; finance, cattle disease governance; whether respondent thinks future disease situation in cattle in the wider industry will get better or worse; other important factors in cattle disease management.
The relational database CSV output table files include results from two questionnaires that covered 148 farms; the first questionnaire has approximately 12 sections, with 10 to 50 quantitative questions per section; the second questionnaire has 2 sections, with a similar number of questions. Serum samples were taken three times from farms; all adult animals (&gt;2yrs old) were sampled. Each sample was tested for five different diseases by ELISA test, and antigen for one infection. The SQL schema files define the database structure. Further information on the database structure and table relationships is included in the database documentation.

The study is part of the Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme.\\nThe Governance of Livestock Disease (GoLD) project ran from November 2007 to November 2010. The overall aim of the project was to develop an interdisciplinary framework to elucidate the governance of livestock diseases (i.e. the reciprocal impacts of dynamic changes to epidemiology, policy, law and economy) in order to better inform stakeholders of the potential impact of different policy and regulatory changes. Two kinds of data (referred to as 'datasets' below, some of which had been collected under earlier grants) were used to complete this work and both are available from the UK Data Archive within this study:Dataset 1: questionnaire data were collected from 148 farmers and serum samples were collected from all cattle in a subset of 114 farms. Data collection was funded by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) project SE3026, Bovine TB Transmission in Restocked Herds: Risk Factors and Dynamics, conducted between June 2002 and March 2006. The serum samples were subsequently analysed for antibodies to five endemic diseases in the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) project BBS/B/04854 Epidemiology and Transmission Dynamics of Endemic Infectious Disease in the British Cattle Population, conducted between October 2004 and February 2008. The relational database includes both the questionnaire data and the quantitative serological data.Dataset 2: within the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) RELU funded grant Decision-making Frameworks in Management of Livestock disease: Interaction of Epidemiology, Economics and Politics, which ran from November 2007 to November 2010, the project team conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 farmers concentrating on their attitudes to endemic disease, information sources and relationship with their veterinarian.The farmer interviews covered: background and details about farm; general cattle disease on the farm; six specific cattle diseases: bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVD), Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), bovine tuberculosis (TB), Leptospira, Neospora and Johnes disease; control of disease; cattle in and out of the herd; neighbouring farms; finance, cattle disease governance; whether respondent thinks future disease situation in cattle in the wider industry will get better or worse; other important factors in cattle disease management.\\nThe relational database CSV output table files include results from two questionnaires that covered 148 farms; the first questionnaire has approximately 12 sections, with 10 to 50 quantitative questions per section; the second questionnaire has 2 sections, with a similar number of questions. Serum samples were taken three times from farms; all adult animals (\u003e2yrs old) were sampled. Each sample was tested for five different diseases by ELISA test, and antigen for one infection.
