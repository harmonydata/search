This research project is a comparison of the use of school inspection as a form of governing of education in the three systems of Sweden, Scotland and England, in the context of current changes in inspection practices in Europe. We are investigating the tensions between ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ governance revealed by analysis of inspection policies and processes.
