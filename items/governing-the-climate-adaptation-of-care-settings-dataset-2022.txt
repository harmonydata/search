The locations monitored consisted of 22 offices (staff-only areas such as manager’s offices, administrator offices, nurse stations), 30 lounges (communal areas such as lounges, dining rooms and lounge/diners), and 30 bedrooms (single rooms, with a range of occupancy – some vacant, some occupied only at night, others occupied 24/7 depending on resident needs).

The UK also currently has a rapidly ageing population, with people aged 75 or over expected to account for 13% of the total population by 2035. Older populations are more vulnerable to climate-induced effects as they are more likely to have underlying, chronic health complications, making them more vulnerable to heat stress. The indoor environment is a principle moderator of heat exposure in older populations, who tend to spend the majority of their time indoors. Poor building design, the lack of effective heat management and diverging needs and preferences between staff and residents in care settings may contribute to increased indoor heat exposure with detrimental health impacts falling on the most vulnerable residents.

However, preliminary modelling as part of the pilot project also demonstrated that common passive cooling strategies may not adequately mitigate overheating risk in the 2050s and 2080s. Further research into advanced passive cooling strategies, combined with human behaviour and organisational change is required to identify optimum climate adaptation pathways for UK's care provision.

The main aim of the project is to quantify climate related heat risks in care settings nationwide and enhance understanding of human behaviour, organisational capacity and governance to enable the UK's care provision to develop equitable adaptation pathways to rising heat stress under climate change. Building on the foundations of the pilot project, this novel, interdisciplinary project will collect, for the first time in the UK, longitudinal temperature and humidity data in a panel of 50 care settings in order to quantify the recurring risk of summertime overheating. We will also identify and assess social, institutional and cultural barriers and opportunities underpinning the governance of adaptation to a warmer climate in care and extra-care homes through surveys with residents, frontline care staff, managers and policy stakeholders. Within sub-samples of this panel, we will use innovative measurement techniques to collect residents' physiological data and study their relation with heat exposure and health impacts. Also for the first time in the UK, we will create a building stock model of the UK's care provision able to predict future overheating risks in care settings under a range of future climate change scenarios. This will help evaluate the effectiveness of near, medium and long term future overheating mitigation strategies and policies on thermal comfort and health outcomes. Throughout the project, we will continue to develop and expand the stakeholder community that was created during the pilot project.18:T124f,The dataset consists of air temperatures recorded longitudinally and reported at hourly intervals using Hobo MX1101, Hobo MX1102A and Hobo MX2301 devices. The monitoring period covered 1st May 2022 to 30th September 2022 inclusive – the full non-heating season in England.  

The devices were deployed in 30 care homes across England: eleven in Greater London, nine in the north of England as far north as Newcastle-upon-Tyne, six in the Midlands, and four in the south of England including on the Isle of Wight. The locations monitored consisted of 22 offices (staff-only areas such as manager’s offices, administrator offices, nurse stations), 30 lounges (communal areas such as lounges, dining rooms and lounge/diners), and 30 bedrooms (single rooms, with a range of occupancy – some vacant, some occupied only at night, others occupied 24/7 depending on resident needs). In addition, outdoor temperatures were monitored at each of the 30 care homes.As a result of global climate change, the UK is expected to experience hotter and drier summers, and heatwaves are expected to occur with greater frequency, intensity and duration. In 2003 and 2018, 2,091 and 863 heat-related deaths, respectively, were reported in England alone as a result of heatwaves, meaning future temperature increases could lead to a parallel rise in heat-related mortality. The UK also currently has a rapidly ageing population, with people aged 75 or over expected to account for 13% of the total population by 2035. Older populations are more vulnerable to climate-induced effects as they are more likely to have underlying, chronic health complications, making them more vulnerable to heat stress. The indoor environment is a principle moderator of heat exposure in older populations, who tend to spend the majority of their time indoors. Poor building design, the lack of effective heat management and diverging needs and preferences between staff and residents in care settings may contribute to increased indoor heat exposure with detrimental health impacts falling on the most vulnerable residents. Maladaptation to a warming climate, such as the uptake of air conditioning, could increase fuel bills in care homes, increase operational costs for businesses in the already financially stretched care sector, and increase building carbon emissions, thus undermining government efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

The one-year pilot project 'Climate Resilience of Care Settings' and previous small-scale studies led by our research team have shown that UK care homes are already overheating even under non-extreme summers. A key target for climate adaptation in care settings is to limit such risks by introducing passive cooling strategies via building design. However, preliminary modelling as part of the pilot project also demonstrated that common passive cooling strategies may not adequately mitigate overheating risk in the 2050s and 2080s. Further research into advanced passive cooling strategies, combined with human behaviour and organisational change is required to identify optimum climate adaptation pathways for UK's care provision.
