The backbone of this data is the &quot;summer awarding&quot; data that is collected for each qualification taken by pupils prior to grades being issued to centres and students in August each year. The Ofqual data will also include the grade awarded to pupils who asked for a review of marking and moderation. The qualifications dataset includes detailed information on the qualifications taken , as well as granular data on pupils&#x27; attainment. Information about pupils, such as gender and age, is also contained in this dataset. For 2020, given that exams were cancelled and alternative approaches to grading taken, each entry was associated with a centre assessment grade and calculated grade, which were used to determine the awarded grade. These alternative grading approaches is also included, along with details of pupils&#x27; prior attainment: an indicator of Key Stage 2 attainment for GCSE pupils, indicators of GCSE attainment for A level students.

In addition to the qualifications dataset, Ofqual data features two more data tables: a centres dataset with key information on the school or college attended (type and geographical location), a grade boundaries dataset which allows to interpret the marks in the main qualifications dataset.

The National Pupil Database is compiled for the Department for Education (DfE) from data supplied by local authorities, centres and awarding organisations. The NPD is a collection of data covering all pupils within schools in England up to the age of 19. There are four main extracts of the NPD shared. The NPD exam results datasets contain pupil-level results data by qualification taken for Key Stages 4 and 5, covering A levels, GCSE and other general and vocational/technical qualifications, as provided by awarding organisations. It includes aggregated achievement indicators, such as those related to EBacc, Attainment 8 and Progress 8.
The NPD pupil datasets contain data on pupils, including demographic and protected characteristics, such as gender, age, language spoken, free school meal eligibility and special educational needs. Information on the centre attended by pupils is also available, covering the type of school or institution, its description, whether the main language is English or Welsh and the school admissions policy. Additional information on pupils is also available in the census datasets. This includes further socio-demographic characteristics (eg ethnicity) and socio-economic indicators (eg IDACI score).
