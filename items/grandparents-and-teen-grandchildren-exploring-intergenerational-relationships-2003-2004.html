This research redressed the balance by adopting a qualitative approach to explore the experiences of both grandparents and grandchildren. It considered variations in the same person’s relationships with several grandchildren or grandparents, placing these in the context of each individual’s family, social networks and socio-economic environments. The study emphasised the dynamic nature of grandparent-grandchild relations by examining perceived changes related to life stage and the implications of various family transitions, formations and mobility. The research adopted a qualitative approach to explore in depth the meaning and significance of grandparent-grandchild relations. Interviews and group discussions were held with respondents from both generations and included related and unrelated grandparents and grandchildren. Those with related pairs enabled comparison of views of the same relationship, while those with unrelated participants provided more general comparisons within and across generations. Altogether 148 respondents took part in the study, 75 young people and 73 older people with at least one teenage grandchild. Half the young people were aged 10-14, half aged 15-19. Grandparent respondents ranged in age from early 50s to late 80s. Respondents were chosen to provide a social spread, and were drawn from affluent and less affluent, urban and rural areas. The sampling was also intended to include participants from minority ethnic backgrounds, Scottish-Chinese and Scottish-Pakistani Muslim. The majority of the transcripts have been made available.

Information has mainly been gathered from grandparents, parents and young adults, with few studies including the views of children and young people or containing the perspectives of related grandparents and grandchildren. This research redressed the balance by adopting a qualitative approach to explore the experiences of both grandparents and grandchildren. It considered variations in the same person’s relationships with several grandchildren or grandparents, placing these in the context of each individual’s family, social networks and socio-economic environments. The study emphasised the dynamic nature of grandparent-grandchild relations by examining perceived changes related to life stage and the implications of various family transitions, formations and mobility. The research adopted a qualitative approach to explore in depth the meaning and significance of grandparent-grandchild relations. Interviews and group discussions were held with respondents from both generations and included related and unrelated grandparents and grandchildren. Those with related pairs enabled comparison of views of the same relationship, while those with unrelated participants provided more general comparisons within and across generations. Altogether 148 respondents took part in the study, 75 young people and 73 older people with at least one teenage grandchild. Half the young people were aged 10-14, half aged 15-19. Grandparent respondents ranged in age from early 50s to late 80s. Respondents were chosen to provide a social spread, and were drawn from affluent and less affluent, urban and rural areas. The sampling was also intended to include participants from minority ethnic backgrounds, Scottish-Chinese and Scottish-Pakistani Muslim. The majority of the transcripts have been made available. This dataset comprises 63 of these transcripts.\",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/grandparents-and-teen-grandchildren-exploring-intergenerational-relationships-2003-2004\",\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-5231-1\"],\"keywords\":[]}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"19:Ta3d,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"This research focused on the nature of grandparent-grandchild relationships, exploring the ways in which family and societal contexts are impacting on this kinship relation.
