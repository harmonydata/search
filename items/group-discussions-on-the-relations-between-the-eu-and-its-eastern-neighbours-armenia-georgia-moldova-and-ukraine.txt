Four case studies explored four sectors: food safety, state aid, gas market and visa liberalisation. Discussions took place in 
Armenia, Georgia and Moldova and two in Ukraine, between March 2013 and June 2014.

What role does the European Union (EU) play in domestic change in the post-Soviet states? This question has gained salience since the EU has stepped up its role in the region to facilitate these countries' alignment with EU rules, norms and standards (the acquis).
However, no precedent exists for EU's promotion of the acquis as a template for development without the concurrent membership prospective. Thus the EU engagement in the post-Soviet states provides an excellent opportunity to analyse the EU's transformative power' outside the context of enlargement.
