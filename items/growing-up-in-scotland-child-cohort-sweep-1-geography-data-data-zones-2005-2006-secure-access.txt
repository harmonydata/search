Launched in 2005, GUS has collected information on three nationally representative cohorts of children born in 2004-05 (Birth Cohort 1), 2002-03 (Child Cohort) and 2010-11 (Birth Cohort 2). This page provides information about Birth Cohort 2 (BC2). The main aim of the study is to provide new information to support policymaking in Scotland, but it is also intended to provide a resource for practitioners, academics, the voluntary sector and parents.","url":["","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=GUSBC1","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=GUSBC2","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=GUSCC1"],"keywords":["Diet and nutrition","Work and employment","Cognitive measures","Puberty","Social care - receipt","Political and social attitudes","Parenting and family","Social care - provision","Sexuality and gender identity","Education","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Reproductive health","Loneliness and social isolation","Digital technology and social media","Language and literacy","Physical health assessment","Housing","Sleep problems","Social care - need","Victimisation and life events","Ethnicity and race","Neighbourhood"],"identifier":[],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=GUSBC2","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=GUSBC1","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=GUSCC1","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"}],"publisher":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Scottish Government & ScotCen Social Research "}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Scottish Government & ScotCen Social Research "}],"funder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Scot"}],"license":["https://growingupinscotland.org.uk/using-gus-data/accessing-gus-data/","https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/series/series?id=200020#","https://growingupinscotland.org.uk/accessing-gus-data"],"image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/GUSBC2.png","temporalCoverage":"2005/..","size":"6127"},"extra_data":{"keywords":["Diet and nutrition","Work and employment","Cognitive measures","Puberty","Social care - receipt","Political and social attitudes","Parenting and family","Social care - provision","Sexuality and gender identity","Education","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Reproductive health","Loneliness and social isolation","Digital technology and social media","Language and literacy","Physical health assessment","Housing","Sleep problems","Social care - need","Victimisation and life events","Ethnicity and race","Neighbourhood"],"study_design":["longitudinal","cohort","birth"],"instruments":[],"resource_type":"study","country_codes":["GB"],"name":"Growing Up in Scotland","source":["ukds","mhc"],"uuid":"48fecfb6e07ce093519b2f076ec2047b","number_of_variables":472},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]}]}}]

1c:Te47,The Growing Up in Scotland (GUS) study is a large-scale longitudinal social survey which follows the lives of several groups of Scottish children from infancy through childhood and adolescence, and aims to provide important new information on children and their families in Scotland. The study forms a central part of the Scottish Government's strategy for the long-term monitoring and evaluation of its policies for children, with a specific focus on the early years. Unlike other similar cohort studies, this survey has a specifically Scottish focus. A key objective of GUS is to address a significant gap in the evidence base for early years policy monitoring and evaluation. The study seeks both to describe the characteristics, circumstances and experiences of children in their early years (and their parents) in Scotland and, through its longitudinal design, to generate a better understanding of how children's start in life can shape their longer term prospects and development.Since 2005, study design and data collection have been undertaken by ScotCen Social Research with collaborations with the Centre for Research on Families and Relationships, based at the University of Edinburgh and the MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit over certain periods of the project. The survey design consisted of recruiting an initial total of 8,000 parents in 2005, comprising two cohorts of children (5,000 from birth, 3,000 from age two years and ten months), and then interviewing parents annually until their child reached age five years ten months. Further fieldwork was undertaken with the birth cohort when the children were around eight, ten, twelve and fourteen years old.  A boost sample of 500 children from predominantly high deprivation areas was added to the cohort as part of the age 12 fieldwork.Data is collected via an in-home, face-to-face interview with self-complete sections. Fieldwork for sweep 10 was disrupted due to the COVID pandemic. As a result, the final portion of the data was collected via web and telephone questionnaires.Special Licence data:The main survey data are available under Special Licence:SNs 9373-9383 and 9386-9387 - Growing Up in Scotland: Cohort 1SN 7432 - Growing Up in Scotland: Cohort 2SN 8366 - Growing Up in Scotland: Cohort 1, Primary 6 Teacher SurveySecure Access Geographic Data:Geographic data are available under Secure Access and are separated by cohort, sweep and  type of geographic variable.
