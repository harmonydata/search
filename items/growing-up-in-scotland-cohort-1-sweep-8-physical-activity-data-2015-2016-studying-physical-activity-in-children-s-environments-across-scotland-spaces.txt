Previously they were held under one study (SN 5760) which has been withdrawn from the data catalogue. SN 9120 - Growing Up in Scotland: Cohort 1, Sweep 8 Physical Activity Data, 2015-2016The Studying Physical Activity in Children's Environments across Scotland (SPACES) project aimed to investigate the ways in which the built, natural and social environment influences children's physical activity. The project employed an observational, cross-sectional design that sub-sampled from Birth Cohort 1 (BC1) of the GUSÂ during the GUS Sweep 8 fieldwork. Children sub-sampled from GUS were invited to provide objectively measured physical activity data by wearing an accelerometer for eight days.This datasetÂ provides a range of summary physical activity variables from this project. A total of 775 children provided valid data. As a sub sample of GUS BC1, the summary level physical activity data can be linked, where appropriate, to other GUS BC1 datasets held on UKDS at the individual level. The physical activity data were collected between May 2015 and May 2016 by the MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit (SPHSU), University of Glasgow.
To support a range of analytical projects, a series of summary variables have been derived and included in the dataset. These include minutes spent in different categories of physical activity and variables indicating whether the child met the recommended Scottish Government guidelines of 60 minutes of physical activity each day (calculated in two forms: an average of 60 minutes per day overall valid days; a stricter measure of actual 60 minutes per day on each valid day).17:Td48,The Growing Up in Scotland (GUS) study is a large-scale longitudinal social survey which follows the lives of several groups of Scottish children from infancy through childhood and adolescence. It aims to provide important information on children, young people and their families in Scotland. The study forms a central part of the Scottish Government's strategy for the long-term monitoring and evaluation of its policies for children and young people, with a specific focus on the early years. The study seeks both to describe the characteristics, circumstances and experiences of children in their early years in Scotland and, through its longitudinal design, to generate a better understanding of how children's start in life can shape their longer term prospects and developmentSince 2005 fieldwork has been undertaken by the Scottish Centre for Social Research. The survey design for Birth Cohort 1 consisted of recruiting the parents of an initial total of 5,217 children aged 10 months old in 2005 and interviewing them annually until their child reached age six. Further fieldwork was then undertaken at ages 8, 10, 12, 14 and 17-18 with a sample boost added at age 12.Data for sweeps 1-9 were collected via an in-home, face-to-face interview with self-complete sections. Fieldwork for sweep 10 was disrupted due to the COVID pandemic. As a result, the final portion of the data was collected via web and telephone questionnaires. Sweep 11 data were gathered via web, telephone and face-to-face surveys of cohort members and their parent/carer.Further information about the survey may be found on theÂ Growing Up in ScotlandÂ website.In May 20205, data and documentation for Cohort 1, Sweeps 1-11 were released as individual studies (SNs 9373-9383 and 9386-9387).
