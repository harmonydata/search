Launched in 2005, GUS has collected information on three nationally representative cohorts of children born in 2004-05 (Birth Cohort 1), 2002-03 (Child Cohort) and 2010-11 (Birth Cohort 2). This page provides information about Birth Cohort 2 (BC2). The main aim of the study is to provide new information to support policymaking in Scotland, but it is also intended to provide a resource for practitioners, academics, the voluntary sector and parents.","url":["","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=GUSBC1","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=GUSBC2","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=GUSCC1"],"keywords":["Education","Social care - receipt","Physical health assessment","Sexuality and gender identity","Cognitive measures","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Reproductive health","Political and social attitudes","Social care - provision","Puberty","Ethnicity and race","Parenting and family","Language and literacy","Digital technology and social media","Neighbourhood","Housing","Victimisation and life events","Diet and nutrition","Social care - need","Loneliness and social isolation","Work and employment","Sleep problems"],"identifier":[],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=GUSBC2","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=GUSBC1","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=GUSCC1","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"}],"publisher":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Scottish Government & ScotCen Social Research "}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Scottish Government & ScotCen Social Research "}],"funder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Scot"}],"license":["https://growingupinscotland.org.uk/using-gus-data/accessing-gus-data/","https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/series/series?id=200020#","https://growingupinscotland.org.uk/accessing-gus-data"],"image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/GUSBC2.png","temporalCoverage":"2005/..","size":"6127"},"extra_data":{"source":["mhc","ukds"],"keywords":["Education","Social care - receipt","Physical health assessment","Sexuality and gender identity","Cognitive measures","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Reproductive health","Political and social attitudes","Social care - provision","Puberty","Ethnicity and race","Parenting and family","Language and literacy","Digital technology and social media","Neighbourhood","Housing","Victimisation and life events","Diet and nutrition","Social care - need","Loneliness and social isolation","Work and employment","Sleep problems"],"country_codes":["GB"],"resource_type":"study","name":"Growing Up in Scotland: Birth Cohort 2","instruments":[],"study_design":["longitudinal","cohort","birth"],"uuid":"48fecfb6e07ce093519b2f076ec2047b","number_of_variables":119},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]}]}}]]}]

18:T111c,The Growing Up in Scotland (GUS) study is a large-scale longitudinal social survey which follows the lives of several groups of Scottish children from infancy through childhood and adolescence. It aims to provide important information on children, young people and their families in Scotland. The study forms a central part of the Scottish Government's strategy for the long-term monitoring and evaluation of its policies for children and young people, with a specific focus on the early years. The study seeks both to describe the characteristics, circumstances and experiences of children in their early years in Scotland and, through its longitudinal design, to generate a better understanding of how children's start in life can shape their longer term prospects and developmentSince 2005 fieldwork has been undertaken by the Scottish Centre for Social Research. The survey design for Birth Cohort 1 consisted of recruiting the parents of an initial total of 5,217 children aged 10 months old in 2005 and interviewing them annually until their child reached age six. Further fieldwork was then undertaken at ages 8, 10, 12, 14 and 17-18 with a sample boost added at age 12.Data for sweeps 1-9 were collected via an in-home, face-to-face interview with self-complete sections. Fieldwork for sweep 10 was disrupted due to the COVID pandemic. As a result, the final portion of the data was collected via web and telephone questionnaires. Sweep 11 data were gathered via web, telephone and face-to-face surveys of cohort members and their parent/carer.Further information about the survey may be found on the Growing Up in Scotland website.In May 20205, data and documentation for Cohort 1, Sweeps 1-11 were released as individual studies (SNs 9373-9383 and 9386-9387). Previously they were held under one study (SN 5760) which has been withdrawn from the data catalogue. Removal of Geographical Variables and Spatial Unit Variable As of February 2018, at the data owner's request, the variables recording the 15% most deprived data zones, the 8 fold urban-rural classification and the Health Boards have been removed from all sweeps (where included). The variables removed are:
Sweep 1: ALaLow15, ALaHBdBc;Sweep 2: ALcLow15, ALcURin1, ALcHBdBc.
New edition informationFor the fourth edition (May 2019), an error in the Sweep 3 data has been correct (the SIMD variable ALeSNim2 has been inverted to match the variable included in previous sweeps). Sweep 1: household information; infant feeding; parenting support; non-resident parents; parenting styles and activities; childcare; child health and development; employment and economic activity; income and financial stress; education and identity; housing and accommodation; interviewer observations.
