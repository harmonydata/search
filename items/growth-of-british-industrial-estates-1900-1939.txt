The main aims and objectives of the research project from which this dataset arose were:

(4) To examine the regional impact of industrial estate development.


 This dataset provides estimates of the number of industrial estates established in Britain, their locations, the companies or other institutions that developed them, and the number of employees working in them at several 'benchmark' dates.
