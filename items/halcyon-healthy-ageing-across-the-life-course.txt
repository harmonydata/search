Another main aim was to test the associations of factors across life with each of these three sets of measures.  In the majority of cases, this involved harmonising secondary data from the 9 participating studies which had been provided to the HALCyon study team by cohort PIs.  The nine studies included were: the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), the National Child Development Study (NCDS), Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 (LBC1921), Aberdeen Birth Cohort 1936 (ABC1936), Herfordshire Ageing Study (HAS), Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS), the Boyd Orr Cohort study, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and the Caerphilly Prospective Study (CaPS) .  

The first step in this process was to document details of the potentially relevant variables already collected and available in each study.  The second step in this process was to write syntax which cleaned and recoded relevant variables for use in comparable analyses.

In addition to the publications produced (see www.halcyon.ac.uk), other key outputs from HALCyon are: (i) the documentation created which lists out the comparable variables available in each cohort for topics of relevance to HALCyon; (ii) Stata syntax which was used to clean and recode existing data for use in analyses that were comparable across cohorts.  These meta-data documents (i.e. variable lists by topic and stata do files) have been uploaded.  

2) New data generated by the HALCyon project

The NDA grant for HALCyon also included funds to:
- collect comparable data on wellbeing in: Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS); Caerphilly Prospective Study (CaPS); Aberdeen Birth Cohort 1936 (ABC1936)
- measure telomere length using existing blood samples in: Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 (LBC1921); CaPS; Hertfordshire Ageing study (HAS); NSHD (sub-set of samples)
- perform cortisol assays using existing saliva samples in: CaPS and NSHD
- undertake 60 qualitative interviews (30 each) in: HCS; NSHD.

HALCyon makes use of secondary data from 9 different UK cohort studies so each study is responsible for governing their own consent forms.  However, the consent form for the qualitative interviews has been uploaded.  A user guide on the data/metadata that is available has also been uploaded.

HALCyon brings together an interdisciplinary group of scientists working on nine UK cohort studies to understand three aspects of healthy ageing: physical and cognitive capability (the ability to undertake the physical and mental tasks of everyday living), psychological and social wellbeing (how people feel and how they function in terms of relationships and social activities), and the biology of ageing, including cortisol (one of the body's stress hormones), telomere length (the cell's natural clock that tells the body how old it is) and genetic factors.

The eight projects will investigate how individual factors such as early development, lifetime health, personality and nutrition, and characteristics of areas in which study members have lived influence these indicators of healthy ageing. These factors may explain why some older people live fulfilled and active lives and why differences exist between men and women, or between social groups. Some cohort members will be interviewed to find out how they understand their life history and experiences and their response to ageing.

Interactions between the scientists and experts in policy, practice and user involvement will ensure that the new knowledge gained will improve the lives of older people.18:Tf04,1) Meta-data (for existing data) generated by the HALCyon project

One of the main aims of HALCyon was to perform comparable analyses across 9 British cohort studies which tested the inter-relationships between: physical and cognitive capability; social and psychological wellbeing and; underlying biological markers of ageing.
