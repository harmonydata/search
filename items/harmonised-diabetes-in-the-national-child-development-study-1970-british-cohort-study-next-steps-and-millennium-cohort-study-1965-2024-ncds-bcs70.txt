The National Child Development Study started in 1958 as the Perinatal Mortality Survey. Sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund, the survey was designed to examine the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy among the children born in Great Britain.

By collecting information on various aspects of life, the NCDS has become an invaluable data source on such diverse topics as effects of socioeconomic circumstances on health, social mobility and changes in social attitudes. Today, the 1958 cohort is one of the best resources for understanding how retirement and ageing are changing in Britain.

With quantitative and qualitative, social and biomedical data, the 1958 cohort is a leading resource for both policy development and best practice in longitudinal research.

19:T9b0,The Harmonised Data in Five National Longitudinal Cohort Studies project, supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), brings together data from five British cohort studies: the 1946 National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), the 1958 National Child Development Survey (NCDS), the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), Next Steps (formerly the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England), and the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS). NCDS, BCS70, Next Steps, and MCS receive core funding from the ESRC and are hosted by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies at UCL. NSHD is funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and is hosted by the Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL. The Diabetes Harmonisation project aimed to document all self-reported measures related to diabetes in these five British cohort studies and produce harmonised indicators of self-reported diabetes through retrospective harmonisation. This harmonisation serves two primary purposes: improving the measurement of diabetes (as an outcome, predictor, or control variable) within cohort analyses, and facilitating cross-cohort research on diabetes using these rich datasets.Separate longitudinal datasets were created for each cohort, focusing on self-reported data with some information derived from doctors' reports and medical records. Biomarkers and linked health data were not included. Focus was given to measures that were administered to entire cohorts only and on the diabetes status of cohort members themselves (not their parents or children).Harmonised diabetes data for the MRC National Survey of Health and Development are available under Special Licence from SN 9421. The following four data files are included:harmonised_diabetes_ncds: harmonised indicators of self-reported diabetes in the 1958 NCDS and includes sweep-specific indicators, derived cumulative indicators, and derived diabetes type.harmonised_diabetes_bcs: harmonised indicators of self-reported diabetes in the 1970 BCS and includes sweep-specific indicators, derived cumulative indicators, and derived diabetes type.harmonised_diabetes_nextsteps: harmonised indicators of self-reported diabetes in Next Steps and includes sweep-specific indicators only.harmonised_diabetes_mcs: harmonised indicators of self-reported diabetes in MCS and includes sweep-specific indicators only.Individual identifiers are included to enable the harmonised data to be merged with the main cohort study data.1a:T9b0,The Harmonised Data in Five National Longitudinal Cohort Studies project, supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), brings together data from five British cohort studies: the 1946 National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), the 1958 National Child Development Survey (NCDS), the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), Next Steps (formerly the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England), and the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS).
