Harmonised fertility data for NCDS, BCS70 and Next Steps are available under Safeguarded data access from SN 9418. The dataset contains fertility variables derived in the NSHD at age 19, 20, 22, 26, 31, 36, 43 and 53.The research IDs differ from the original research IDs and data can therefore not be merged with other NSHD data files. Access to the harmonised variables in connection with other NSHD variables can be requested via the usual NSHD data sharing request.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Harmonised Fertility Histories in the MRC National Survey of Health and Development, 1965-2024: Special Licence Access / NSHD"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Harmonised Fertility Histories in the MRC National Survey of Health and Development, 1965-2024: Special Licence Access / NSHD"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/harmonised-fertility-histories-in-the-mrc-national-survey-of-health-and-development-1965-2024-special-licence-access-nshd"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Harmonised Fertility Histories in the MRC National Survey of Health and Development, 1965-2024: Special Licence Access / NSHD"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Harmonised Fertility Histories in the MRC National Survey of Health and Development, 1965-2024: Special Licence Access / NSHD"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
