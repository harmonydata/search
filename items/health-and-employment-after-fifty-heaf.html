Participants completed a questionnaire about their work and home circumstances at baseline, and were regularly followed-up, initially for a 5-year period. With permission, primary care health records via the CPRD were also accessed.  The inter-relation of changes in employment (with reasons) and changes in health (e.g., major new illnesses, new treatments, mortality) will be examined. 
Findings will inform government policy and also the design of work for older people and the measures needed to support employment in later life, especially for those with health limitations.

With permission, primary care health records via the CPRD were also accessed.  The inter-relation of changes in employment (with reasons) and changes in health (e.g., major new illnesses, new treatments, mortality) will be examined. \nFindings will inform government policy and also the design of work for older people and the measures needed to support employment in later life, especially for those with health limitations. \n\nStudy website: https://www.mrc.soton.ac.uk/heaf/","url":"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/health-and-employment-after-fifty-heaf","keywords":["Social care - need","Social care - provision","Work and employment","Housing","Diet and nutrition","Sleep problems","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Physical health assessment"],"identifier":["https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-015-2396-8"],"variableMeasured":[{"name":"dropcprd","description":"NOT to use in the CPRD"},{"name":"practice","description":"Practice ID"},{"name":"areanum","description":"Area of GP (regrouped)"},{"name":"deprivation","description":"Practice level of deprivation"},{"name":"deprivation3g","description":"Thirds of area deprivation"},{"name":"aagecomp","description":"Age at recruitment"},{"name":"aageclass","description":"Age at recruitment - groups"},{"name":"aethnicorx","description":"Please indicate your ethnic origin (Tick one box)","options":["Pakistani","Black-African","Black-Carribean","Chinese","Other (please specify)","Black-Other","Indian","Bangladeshi","White"]},{"name":"amstat","description":"What is your current marital status?

Participants completed a questionnaire about their work and home circumstances at baseline, and were regularly followed-up, initially for a 5-year period. With permission, primary care health records via the CPRD were also accessed.  The inter-relation of changes in employment (with reasons) and changes in health (e.g., major new illnesses, new treatments, mortality) will be examined. 
Findings will inform government policy and also the design of work for older people and the measures needed to support employment in later life, especially for those with health limitations.
