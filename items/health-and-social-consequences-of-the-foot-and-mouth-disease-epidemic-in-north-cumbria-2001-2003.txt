The research was based in the Cumbria area, where economic, social and political life was greatly affected by the FMD outbreak.

The panel was recruited to reflect a broad range of occupations including farmers and their families, workers in related agricultural occupations, those in small businesses including tourism, hotel trades and rural business, health professionals, veterinary practitioners, voluntary organisations and residents living near disposal sites. The panel members produced 3,200 weekly diaries of enormous intensity and diversity over an 18 month period. The data were supplemented by in-depth interviews with each respondent, and focus group discussions, and in addition, 16 other interviews with stakeholders were conducted. All material was transcribed and digitised. \n\nThe research findings are relevant for the understanding of the kind of support people need both in disaster situations and during the recovery process.
