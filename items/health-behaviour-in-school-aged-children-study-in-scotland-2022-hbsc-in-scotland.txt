HBSC takes a broad perspective, gathering information across a wide range of health and wellbeing domains relevant to young people, focusing on the social contexts in which they are growing up, including school, family, peers and the online environment. The HBSC study focuses on young people attending school aged 11, 13 and 15 years. These age groups cover important stages of physical and emotional development in young people during a period of rapid physical and neurological change from the onset of adolescence to the middle teenage years when key life and career decisions are being made. The survey is administered to a nationally representative sample of pupils from each age group in schools via a self-completion survey. In 2022, data were collected online for the first time. As part of a cross-national study, HBSC also provides the opportunity to compare the health and well-being of Scotland’s adolescents with their peers in over 50 countries across Europe and North America. The first national HBSC survey was conducted in Scotland in 1990, and national surveys have been conducted every four years since then, in line with the cross-national survey cycle.
