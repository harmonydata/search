The second and following HEPS surveys were then conducted every March and September until September 2005 (ten waves in total), with two waves comprising each yearly dataset (see SNs 4950-4952, 5202 and 5470). Fieldwork was then commissioned for a further four waves, with waves eleven and twelve (conducted January-April and August-December 2006) comprising the 2006 dataset, held under SN 5713.  These were followed by waves thirteen and fourteen (conducted January-April and August-November 2007) and are held under SN 6023.

The main objectives of HEPS are as follows:to monitor trends in health-related attitudes, knowledge, beliefs and behaviours, and to assess the impacts of specific activitiescontribute to planning and development of health promotion initiatives through the inclusion of more detailed modules on topical issuesIn the longer term, HEPS aims to develop a strategic view of how and where health promotion activity may be most effective. This can be achieved in the following ways:identifying levels of knowledge regarding the main causes of ill-healthidentifying salient attitudes with respect to health and means of improving healthidentifying levels of motivation with respect to behaviour change to improve healthdeveloping an understanding of how such indicators may be expected to vary between different population groupsdeveloping an understanding of individual patterns of health-related attitudes and behaviour and their relationship to the broader socio-cultural environmentdeveloping an understanding of specific areas of interest
