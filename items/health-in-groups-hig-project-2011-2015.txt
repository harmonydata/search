The aim of the research is to explore the interplay between group identification and health, overcoming the limitations of previous studies.This involves examining the extent to which group identification influences different aspects of mental and physical health.

It is predicted that group identification will have more impact on health than simple physical contact with group members. Moreover, the effects of group identification on health will be compared with the effects exerted by other factors known to predict health, such as socio-economic status and health-related behaviours. The degree to which the effects of group identification on health are independent from the effects of these other factors will also be considered. The prediction that the effects of group identification on health are mediated by perceived social support (ie, the extent to which group members feel they can rely on each other for assistance) will also be tested.

To achieve these aims, the proposed research will: (1) test a large sample of participants (N = ~16,000), drawn from two nations (~8,000 from Scotland and ~8,000 from Italy); (2) use a longitudinal design (two waves across a two-year period: 2012-2014); (3) use an extended range of physical and mental health indicators.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Health in groups (HIG) project 2011-2015"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Health in groups (HIG) project 2011-2015"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/health-in-groups-hig-project-2011-2015"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Health in groups (HIG) project 2011-2015"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Health in groups (HIG) project 2011-2015"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
