Within the overall data, we found there were a number of genotypes that individuals possessed that were significantly correlated to improved training fitness such as cardiorespiratory fitness and also improvements in body mass index. In fact, the more of these “positive alleles” someone possessed the greater their improvements were.Component of health-related fitness are a necessary focus of improvement for health and prevention associated all cause mortality within the sport and exercise science literature. Clinically, it is also an area of focus, especially for those that have poor fitness for the same reasons. Fundamentally, research has constantly reported that individuals respond differentially to identical health-based interventions, suggesting the involvement of a genetic component in individual responses to health, exercise and fitness markers. Previous exercise studies has focused predominantly on a relatively small number of candidate genes and their overall influence in fitness responsiveness. Additionally, the examination of gene-specific alleles are also overlooked, being one of the major limitations within this field. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate individual’s genotypes following a field-based running endurance programme within a previously untrained population within the UK. Participants were randomly assigned to either a training (n = 17) or control group (n = 21). The training group completed a periodized running program for 8-weeks (duration: 20-30-minutes per session, three times per week) whereas the control group continued with their normal daily routines. The data presented here is one-thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) collected for each participant via a saliva sample DNA test kit.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Health-related Fitness: 1000 SNP Genotypes of UK adults, 2021-2023"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Health-related Fitness: 1000 SNP Genotypes of UK adults, 2021-2023"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/health-related-fitness-1000-snp-genotypes-of-uk-adults-2021-2023"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Health-related Fitness: 1000 SNP Genotypes of UK adults, 2021-2023"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Health-related Fitness: 1000 SNP Genotypes of UK adults, 2021-2023"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
