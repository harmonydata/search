CPRD linkage offers major advantages, notably cost-effective capture of frequent, detailed, objective health data. We will be able to examine the impact of health on work at older ages (e.g. how often arthritis suffers have to quit work) and of work on health (e.g. whether mental health is helped or worsened by deferring retirement, and in what circumstances). Findings should inform government policy and improve the design of work for older people.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Health risks and benefits of extended working life (HEAF)"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Health risks and benefits of extended working life (HEAF)"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/health-risks-and-benefits-of-extended-working-life-heaf"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Health risks and benefits of extended working life (HEAF)"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Health risks and benefits of extended working life (HEAF)"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
