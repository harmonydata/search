Topics are revisited at appropriate intervals in order to monitor change. \n\nFurther information about the series may be found on the NHS Digital Health Survey for England; health, social care and lifestyles webpage, the NatCen Social Research NatCen Health Survey for England webpage and the University College London Health and Social Surveys Research Group UCL Health Survey for England webpage.\n\nChanges to the HSE from 2015:Users should note that from 2015 survey onwards, only the individual data file is available under standard End User Licence (EUL). The household data file is now only included in the Special Licence (SL) version, released from 2015 onwards. In addition, the SL individual file contains all the variables included in the HSE EUL dataset, plus others, including variables removed from the EUL version after the NHS Digital disclosure review. The SL HSE is subject to more restrictive access conditions than the EUL version (see Access information). Users are advised to obtain the EUL version to see if it meets their needs before considering an application for the SL version.COVID-19 and the HSE:Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HSE 2020 survey was stopped in March 2020 and never re-started. There was no publication that year. The survey resumed in 2021, albeit with an amended methodology. The full HSE resumed in 2022, with an extended fieldwork period. Due to this, the decision was taken not to progress with the 2023 survey, to maximise the 2022 survey response and enable more robust reporting of data. See the NHS Digital Health Survey for England - Health, social care and lifestyles webpage for more details.\n For the fifth edition (August 2017), a new version of the individual data file was deposited. A Government Office Region variable has been added, and some previous health authority and socio-economic variables removed.\n\n The survey had two separate elements:  an interviewer visit and a nurse visit.  At the first visit all respondents aged 13 and over were asked to give a CAPI (computed assisted) interview, which included a self-completion element, on a range of health related topics.  Parents/Guardians of 2-12 year olds were interviewed about the child. The interview collected information relating to respondents' history of respiratory and atopic conditions, non-fatal accidents, general health and disability.  Adults were questioned about smoking and drinking behaviour.  All respondents aged 8 and over were also asked to complete a booklet.  For adults and young adults (from the age of 13) these self-completion documents contained the General Health Questionnaire, designed to measure psychosocial well-being.  8-17 year olds completed questions on smoking and drinking experiences.  Adults aged 16 and over were asked about incontinence and prescription contraceptives.  All respondents were then asked to have their height and weight measured.  A limited amount of proxy information was obtained, where possible, about those unwilling or unable to take part in the survey.\n\nThose who agreed to the second visit, made later by a nurse, were then surveyed about their use of prescribed medications.  Then, if the respondent was willing, further anthropometric measurements (i.e. demi-span, mid-upper arm circumference) were taken, their blood pressure was measured and they provided a blood sample (which was analysed for IgE, house dust mite IgE, and for children, ferritin, and haemoglobin).

Data on age at death, date of death and causes of death (ICD codes) are also included for those respondents known to have died.16:T136d,The Health Survey for England (HSE) is a series of surveys designed to monitor trends in the nation's health.  It was commissioned by NHS Digital and carried out by the Joint Health Surveys Unit of the National Centre for Social Research and the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London.The aims of the HSE series are:to provide annual data about the nation’s health;to estimate the proportion of people in England with specified health conditions;to estimate the prevalence of certain risk factors associated with these conditions;to examine differences between population subgroups in their likelihood of having specific conditions or risk factors;to assess the frequency with which particular combinations of risk factors are found, and which groups these combinations most commonly occur;to monitor progress towards selected health targetssince 1995, to measure the height of children at different ages, replacing the National Study of Health and Growth;since 1995, monitor the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children.The survey includes a number of core questions every year but also focuses on different health issues at each wave. Topics are revisited at appropriate intervals in order to monitor change. 

Further information about the series may be found on the NHS Digital Health Survey for England; health, social care and lifestyles webpage, the NatCen Social Research NatCen Health Survey for England webpage and the University College London Health and Social Surveys Research Group UCL Health Survey for England webpage.

Changes to the HSE from 2015:Users should note that from 2015 survey onwards, only the individual data file is available under standard End User Licence (EUL). The household data file is now only included in the Special Licence (SL) version, released from 2015 onwards. In addition, the SL individual file contains all the variables included in the HSE EUL dataset, plus others, including variables removed from the EUL version after the NHS Digital disclosure review. The SL HSE is subject to more restrictive access conditions than the EUL version (see Access information). Users are advised to obtain the EUL version to see if it meets their needs before considering an application for the SL version.COVID-19 and the HSE:Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HSE 2020 survey was stopped in March 2020 and never re-started. There was no publication that year. The survey resumed in 2021, albeit with an amended methodology. The full HSE resumed in 2022, with an extended fieldwork period. Due to this, the decision was taken not to progress with the 2023 survey, to maximise the 2022 survey response and enable more robust reporting of data. See the NHS Digital Health Survey for England - Health, social care and lifestyles webpage for more details.
 For the fifth edition (August 2017), a new version of the individual data file was deposited. A Government Office Region variable has been added, and some previous health authority and socio-economic variables removed.

 The survey had two separate elements:  an interviewer visit and a nurse visit.  At the first visit all respondents aged 13 and over were asked to give a CAPI (computed assisted) interview, which included a self-completion element, on a range of health related topics.  Parents/Guardians of 2-12 year olds were interviewed about the child. The interview collected information relating to respondents' history of respiratory and atopic conditions, non-fatal accidents, general health and disability.  Adults were questioned about smoking and drinking behaviour.  All respondents aged 8 and over were also asked to complete a booklet.  For adults and young adults (from the age of 13) these self-completion documents contained the General Health Questionnaire, designed to measure psychosocial well-being.  8-17 year olds completed questions on smoking and drinking experiences.  Adults aged 16 and over were asked about incontinence and prescription contraceptives.  All respondents were then asked to have their height and weight measured.  A limited amount of proxy information was obtained, where possible, about those unwilling or unable to take part in the survey.

Those who agreed to the second visit, made later by a nurse, were then surveyed about their use of prescribed medications.  Then, if the respondent was willing, further anthropometric measurements (i.e. demi-span, mid-upper arm circumference) were taken, their blood pressure was measured and they provided a blood sample (which was analysed for IgE, house dust mite IgE, and for children, ferritin, and haemoglobin).  For a part of the year, blood was also analysed for lead content.
