The data are accompanied by a guide that includes a practical case study enabling users to derive estimates of disability for districts in the absence of survey estimates. This is achieved using various models that combine information from ESDS government surveys with other aggregate data that are reliably available for sub-national areas. Analysis is undertaken using Stata statistical software; all relevant syntax is provided in the accompanying &#x27;.do&#x27; files. 

The data files included in this teaching resource contain HSE variables and data from the Census and Mid-year population estimates and projections that were developed originally by the National Statistical agencies, as follows:The main data file, &#x27;hse_data.dta&#x27;, is a reduced version of the HSE for 2000 and 2001. In order to combine data from two years of the HSE in a consistent way some changes have been made to the weights in each year. Additionally, some recoding of the limiting long term illness (LLTI), disability and the age variable has also been undertaken.File &#x27;practical_1_task_5_data.dta&#x27; contains population counts and model mobility disability rates (estimated during practical 1) distinguishing single year of age and sex for the six case study districts.File &#x27;practical_2_data.dta&#x27; contains the aggregate data required for Practical 2, including age- and sex-specific rates of LLTI (Census) for six UK case study districts, age- and sex-specific rates of mobility disability for England (HSE), and population counts for the six districts.File &#x27;pop_data_practical_3.dta&#x27; contains population counts for the six districts (by age, sex and LLTI status) required for practical 3The original HSEs for 2000 and 2001 are held at the UK Data Archive under SNs 4628 and 4912 respectively.
