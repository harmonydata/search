Topics are revisited at appropriate intervals in order to monitor change.

Changes to the HSE from 2015:Users should note that from 2015 survey onwards, only the individual data file is available under standard End User Licence (EUL). The household data file is now only included in the Special Licence (SL) version, released from 2015 onwards. In addition, the SL individual file contains all the variables included in the HSE EUL dataset, plus others, including variables removed from the EUL version after the NHS Digital disclosure review. The SL HSE is subject to more restrictive access conditions than the EUL version (see Access information). Users are advised to obtain the EUL version to see if it meets their needs before considering an application for the SL version.COVID-19 and the HSE:Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HSE 2020 survey was stopped in March 2020 and never re-started. There was no publication that year. The survey resumed in 2021, albeit with an amended methodology. The full HSE resumed in 2022, with an extended fieldwork period. Due to this, the decision was taken not to progress with the 2023 survey, to maximise the 2022 survey response and enable more robust reporting of data. See the NHS Digital Health Survey for England - Health, social care and lifestyles webpage for more details.
 The HSE 2006 was designed to provide data at both national and regional level about the population living in private households in England. The sample comprised two components; the core (general population) sample and a boost sample of children aged 2-15. The core sample was designed to be representative of the population living in private households in England and should be used for analyses at the national level. 

For the HSE core sample, all adults aged 16 years or older at each household were selected for the interview (up to a maximum of ten adults). However, a limit of two was placed on the number of interviews carried out with children aged 0-15. For households with three or more children, interviewers selected two children at random. At boost addresses interviewers screened for households containing at least one child aged 2-15 years. For households which included eligible children, up to two were selected by the interviewer for inclusion in the survey. Interviewing was conducted throughout the year to take account of seasonal differences.

For the third edition (April 2010), three new children&#x27;s Body Mass Index (BMI) variables have been added to the individual data file (bmicat1, bmicat2, bmicat3).   The original variables (bmicut, bmicut2, bmicut3) are unreliable and should not be used. Further information is available in the documentation and on the Information Centre for Health and Social Care Health Survey for England web page.

For the fourth edition (July 2011), the GHQ12 variables were further amended to correct errors in the GHQ12 scores. See document &#x27;Note about GHQ12 problems in HSE Data&#x27; for details.

 For adult respondents, the HSE 2006 focused on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors. All adults were asked modules of questions on CVD, general health, alcohol consumption, smoking, fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activities. Adults in the core sample aged 65 years and over were randomly allocated one of two questionnaire versions, to avoid lengthy interviews. These included either the CVD module and a short physical activity module, or a long physical activity module but not the CVD module. Adults aged 16-64 completed both the CVD and long physical activity modules. Questionnaire interviews were followed by a nurse visit.

Parents of children aged 0-12 years were asked about their children, with the child interview including questions on physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption. Children aged 13-15 were interviewed themselves.

Survey for England, 2006\",\"description\":\"The Health Survey for England (HSE) is a series of surveys designed to monitor trends in the nation's health.  It was commissioned by NHS Digital and carried out by the Joint Health Surveys Unit of the National Centre for Social Research and the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London.The aims of the HSE series are:to provide annual data about the nation’s health;to estimate the proportion of people in England with specified health conditions;to estimate the prevalence of certain risk factors associated with these conditions;to examine differences between population subgroups in their likelihood of having specific conditions or risk factors;to assess the frequency with which particular combinations of risk factors are found, and which groups these combinations most commonly occur;to monitor progress towards selected health targetssince 1995, to measure the height of children at different ages, replacing the National Study of Health and Growth;since 1995, monitor the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children.The survey includes a number of core questions every year but also focuses on different health issues at each wave. Topics are revisited at appropriate intervals in order to monitor change. \\n\\nFurther information about the series may be found on the NHS Digital Health Survey for England; health, social care and lifestyles webpage, the NatCen Social Research NatCen Health Survey for England webpage and the University College London Health and Social Surveys Research Group UCL Health Survey for England webpage.\\n\\nChanges to the HSE from 2015:Users should note that from 2015 survey onwards, only the individual data file is available under standard End User Licence (EUL). The household data file is now only included in the Special Licence (SL) version, released from 2015 onwards. In addition, the SL individual file contains all the variables included in the HSE EUL dataset, plus others, including variables removed from the EUL version after the NHS Digital disclosure review. The SL HSE is subject to more restrictive access conditions than the EUL version (see Access information). Users are advised to obtain the EUL version to see if it meets their needs before considering an application for the SL version.COVID-19 and the HSE:Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HSE 2020 survey was stopped in March 2020 and never re-started. There was no publication that year. The survey resumed in 2021, albeit with an amended methodology. The full HSE resumed in 2022, with an extended fieldwork period. Due to this, the decision was taken not to progress with the 2023 survey, to maximise the 2022 survey response and enable more robust reporting of data. See the NHS Digital Health Survey for England - Health, social care and lifestyles webpage for more details.\\n The HSE 2006 was designed to provide data at both national and regional level about the population living in private households in England. The sample comprised two components; the core (general population) sample and a boost sample of children aged 2-15. The core sample was designed to be representative of the population living in private households in England and should be used for analyses at the national level. \\n\\nFor the HSE core sample, all adults aged 16 years or older at each household were selected for the interview (up to a maximum of ten adults). However, a limit of two was placed on the number of interviews carried out with children aged 0-15. For households with three or more children, interviewers selected two children at random. At boost addresses interviewers screened for households containing at least one child aged 2-15 years. For households which included eligible children, up to two were selected by the interviewer for inclusion in the survey. Interviewing was conducted throughout the year to take account of seasonal differences.\\n\\nFor the third edition (April 2010), three new children's Body Mass Index (BMI) variables have been added to the individual data file (bmicat1, bmicat2, bmicat3).   The original variables (bmicut, bmicut2, bmicut3) are unreliable and should not be used. Further information is available in the documentation and on the Information Centre for Health and Social Care Health Survey for England web page.\\n\\nFor the fourth edition (July 2011), the GHQ12 variables were further amended to correct errors in the GHQ12 scores. See document 'Note about GHQ12 problems in HSE Data' for details.\\n\\n For adult respondents, the HSE 2006 focused on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors. All adults were asked modules of questions on CVD, general health, alcohol consumption, smoking, fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activities. Adults in the core sample aged 65 years and over were randomly allocated one of two questionnaire versions, to avoid lengthy interviews. These included either the CVD module and a short physical activity module, or a long physical activity module but not the CVD module. Adults aged 16-64 completed both the CVD and long physical activity modules. Questionnaire interviews were followed by a nurse visit.\\n\\nParents of children aged 0-12 years were asked about their children, with the child interview including questions on physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption. Children aged 13-15 were interviewed themselves.\\n\\nStandard Measures:General Health Questionnaire (GHQ12)EQ-5D Health StateStrengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)\",\"url\":\"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/health-survey-for-england-2006\",\"keywords\":[],\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-5809-1\"],\"includedInDataCatalog\":[{\"@type\":\"DataCatalog\",\"name\":\"UK Data Service\",\"url\":\"https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=5809\"}]}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"14:T1569,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"The Health Survey for England (HSE) is a series of surveys designed to monitor trends in the nation's health.  It was commissioned by NHS Digital and carried out by the Joint Health Surveys Unit of the National Centre for Social Research and the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London.The aims of the HSE series are:to provide annual data about the nation’s health;to estimate the proportion of people in England with specified health conditions;to estimate the prevalence of certain risk factors associated with these conditions;to examine differences between population subgroups in their likelihood of having specific conditions or risk factors;to assess the frequency with which particular combinations of risk factors are found, and which groups these combinations most commonly occur;to monitor progress towards selected health targetssince 1995, to measure the height of children at different ages, replacing the National Study of Health and Growth;since 1995, monitor the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children.The survey includes a number of core questions every year but also focuses on different health issues at each wave.

Users are advised to obtain the EUL version to see if it meets their needs before considering an application for the SL version.COVID-19 and the HSE:Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HSE 2020 survey was stopped in March 2020 and never re-started. There was no publication that year. The survey resumed in 2021, albeit with an amended methodology. The full HSE resumed in 2022, with an extended fieldwork period. Due to this, the decision was taken not to progress with the 2023 survey, to maximise the 2022 survey response and enable more robust reporting of data. See the NHS Digital Health Survey for England - Health, social care and lifestyles webpage for more details.\n The HSE 2006 was designed to provide data at both national and regional level about the population living in private households in England. The sample comprised two components; the core (general population) sample and a boost sample of children aged 2-15. The core sample was designed to be representative of the population living in private households in England and should be used for analyses at the national level. \n\nFor the HSE core sample, all adults aged 16 years or older at each household were selected for the interview (up to a maximum of ten adults). However, a limit of two was placed on the number of interviews carried out with children aged 0-15. For households with three or more children, interviewers selected two children at random. At boost addresses interviewers screened for households containing at least one child aged 2-15 years. For households which included eligible children, up to two were selected by the interviewer for inclusion in the survey. Interviewing was conducted throughout the year to take account of seasonal differences.\n\nFor the third edition (April 2010), three new children's Body Mass Index (BMI) variables have been added to the individual data file (bmicat1, bmicat2, bmicat3).   The original variables (bmicut, bmicut2, bmicut3) are unreliable and should not be used. Further information is available in the documentation and on the Information Centre for Health and Social Care Health Survey for England web page.\n\nFor the fourth edition (July 2011), the GHQ12 variables were further amended to correct errors in the GHQ12 scores. See document 'Note about GHQ12 problems in HSE Data' for details.\n\n For adult respondents, the HSE 2006 focused on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors. All adults were asked modules of questions on CVD, general health, alcohol consumption, smoking, fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activities. Adults in the core sample aged 65 years and over were randomly allocated one of two questionnaire versions, to avoid lengthy interviews. These included either the CVD module and a short physical activity module, or a long physical activity module but not the CVD module. Adults aged 16-64 completed both the CVD and long physical activity modules. Questionnaire interviews were followed by a nurse visit.\n\nParents of children aged 0-12 years were asked about their children, with the child interview including questions on physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption. Children aged 13-15 were interviewed themselves.\n\nStandard Measures:General Health Questionnaire (GHQ12)EQ-5D Health StateStrengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"16:T1569,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"The Health Survey for England (HSE) is a series of surveys designed to monitor trends in the nation's health.  It was commissioned by NHS Digital and carried out by the Joint Health Surveys Unit of the National Centre for Social Research and the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London.The aims of the HSE series are:to provide annual data about the nation’s health;to estimate the proportion of people in England with specified health conditions;to estimate the prevalence of certain risk factors associated with these conditions;to examine differences between population subgroups in their likelihood of having specific conditions or risk factors;to assess the frequency with which particular combinations of risk factors are found, and which groups these combinations most commonly occur;to monitor progress towards selected health targetssince 1995, to measure the height of children at different ages, replacing the National Study of Health and Growth;since 1995, monitor the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children.The survey includes a number of core questions every year but also focuses on different health issues at each wave.
