2d:Td29,These comprise anonymous data for experimental work to i) pilot a measure of cognitive change in ageing and ii) gather data about cognitive problems experienced by typically-ageing adults, as part of exploratory work towards producing a diagnostic product for older adults experiencing cognitive change. Data were gathered through an online behavioural task platform (Gorilla) using cognitive tasks and standardised questionnaires (PHQ9, GAI, ESS, NAVQ, GPAQ) plus some non-standardised questions about the impact of perceived cognitive change. Data files are included for all components.

- Demographic data, including: equipment used to complete test; age; gender; ethnicity; work status; level of education; accommodation; marital or partnership status; people in household; reported health conditions; use of alcohol/cigarettes/non-prescribed drugs.
- Task data - user experience; priorities for task development
- Psychometric data - standardised questionnaire information: Patient Health Questionnaire 9; Geriatric Anxiety Inventory; Epworth Sleepiness Scale; Near Activity Visual Questionnaire; Global Physical Activity Questionnaire; non-standardised questions asking about experience of cognitive change in ageing
- Cognitive task data - accuracy and reaction times to visual stimuli

We collected additional data which included measures of diabetes-related health and wellbeing, to further explore potential interactions of ageing with a condition known to have potential impacts on cognition.From around age 50, people experience increasing problems with thinking (cognition), and 1 in 5 go on to develop diagnosed cognitive impairment. In our ageing population, rising numbers of older people are experiencing worsening problems with memory, concentration, and multitasking. Without support, this increasingly affects day-to-day life. As average retirement age rises, it also prevents older adults from maintaining skilled work. This affects individuals' activity and wellbeing, and employers lose critical skills and experience from their workforce. 

Accordingly, identifying these cognitive problems in older adults is crucial to helping them access support, continue working, and fully enjoy life. However, NHS resources cannot assess all older adults for potential cognitive changes. Here, we outline a new approach to identifying cognitive problems, while minimising reliance on stretched healthcare resources.

We will develop an online-access cognitive test for older adults, which can be self-administered at home to test and track cognitive changes. The test will use simple computer-based tasks which are already individually proven to detect changes in memory, concentration, and multi-tasking. This will allow older adults to independently self-test their cognition, as people with diabetes check their blood sugar, without attending specialist clinics.

The test will produce results meaningful to the older person, healthcare professionals, and workplace support systems like occupational health. It will provide results-based recommendations, such as signposting to support services, or using practical, brain-training and social strategies to help manage cognitive changes. We aim to empower older adults to monitor their own cognitive wellbeing, and to identify those needing support to reduce avoidable impact on their wellbeing and work.28:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2d"}]
