A specific objective of the collaboration between PSE and IITA is capacity building for IITA social scientists in rigorous impact evaluation methods, through hands-on collaboration in all the different steps of the research.
The research will provide guidelines on how to address the issue of heterogeneous input quality to our partners at IITA, and more broadly to policy makers and stakeholders interested agricultural productivity in Africa. It will also aim to provide guidelines for future research by scientists within and beyond the CGIAR, and provide key insights to economists and other social sciences studying the puzzle of low adoption in Sub-Saharan Africa.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Heterogeneous quality of agricultural commercial inputs and learning through experimentation, panel survey 2015-2016"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Heterogeneous quality of agricultural commercial inputs and learning through experimentation, panel survey 2015-2016"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/heterogeneous-quality-of-agricultural-commercial-inputs-and-learning-through-experimentation-panel-survey-2015-2016"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Heterogeneous quality of agricultural commercial inputs and learning through experimentation, panel survey 2015-2016"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Heterogeneous quality of agricultural commercial inputs and learning through experimentation, panel survey 2015-2016"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
