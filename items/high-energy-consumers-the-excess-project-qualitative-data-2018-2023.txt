What we are asking
How can we meaningfully identify, assess and characterise households or locations with disproportionately high levels of energy consumption?
What is energy demand being used for in the highest consuming households?
To what extent is high energy demand for domestic use correlated with high energy demand from mobility?
When is income a principal determinant of excess demand, and when is it not?
What is the relationship between energy poverty and excess demand?
