Surveys of prisoners have been carried out systematically since 2000 at institutions being inspected, to gain important insight into detainees' experiences of offender management whilst in custody.Prisoners are issued with the survey questionnaire to return to the HMIP team, which processes the data to inform inspections of individual institutions and the HMIP annual reports.The survey is grouped into topics/themes of questions with response categories, as well as providing space for prisoners to add additional comments (such text comments are not included in these datasets).The specific objectives of the HMIP Prisoner Survey series are as follows:to produce data that are comparable as possible over time and between custodial institutions;to provide data for a large and representative sample of adult prisoners in England and Wales. So far, over 20 years' worth of data has been collected.

The document 'end_user_licence_group_changes', available with the EUL version, SN 9161, details the differences between the two versions.
