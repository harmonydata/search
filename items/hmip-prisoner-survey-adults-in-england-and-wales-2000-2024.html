Surveys of prisoners have been carried out systematically since 2000 at institutions being inspected, to gain important insight into detainees&#x27; experiences of offender management whilst in custody.Prisoners are issued with the survey questionnaire to return to the HMIP team, which processes the data to inform inspections of individual institutions and the HMIP annual reports.The survey is grouped into topics/themes of questions with response categories, as well as providing space for prisoners to add additional comments (such text comments are not included in these datasets).The specific objectives of the HMIP Prisoner Survey series are as follows:to produce data that are comparable as possible over time and between custodial institutions;to provide data for a large and representative sample of adult prisoners in England and Wales. So far, over 20 years&#x27; worth of data has been collected. The survey conducted in 2020/21 was subject to HMIP COVID-19 restrictions. Further information can be found on the HMIP Prisoner Survey webpage.End User Licence and Special Licence versionsTwo versions of the HMIP Prisoner Survey are held at UKDS: an End User Licence (EUL) version (SN 9161) that is subject to registration and standard access conditions, and a more detailed Special Licence (SL) version (SN 9068), which has additional access restrictions. The document &#x27;end_user_licence_group_changes&#x27;, available with the EUL version, SN 9161, details the differences between the two versions. Users should obtain the EUL version first to see whether it is suitable for their needs before considering making an application for access to the SL version.
For the second edition (October 2024), data and documentation for 2023/24 were added to the study. 
Topics covered include demographic categories, functional type of institution, detainees&#x27; experiences of arrival, conditions in prison, support needs and access to legal rights, issues of safety and behavioural management, education and preparation for release.
The data file also contains some sample and administrative variables from the inspection. There are no weighting variables.

Inspectorate's duties to inspect prisons. Surveys of prisoners have been carried out systematically since 2000 at institutions being inspected, to gain important insight into detainees' experiences of offender management whilst in custody.Prisoners are issued with the survey questionnaire to return to the HMIP team, which processes the data to inform inspections of individual institutions and the HMIP annual reports.The survey is grouped into topics/themes of questions with response categories, as well as providing space for prisoners to add additional comments (such text comments are not included in these datasets).The specific objectives of the HMIP Prisoner Survey series are as follows:to produce data that are comparable as possible over time and between custodial institutions;to provide data for a large and representative sample of adult prisoners in England and Wales. So far, over 20 years' worth of data has been collected.
