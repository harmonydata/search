These data were used to evaluate the impact of the project titled &#x27;Enhancing food security and resilience of small farmers in Pakistan&#x27;. The project was carried out in three districts of southern Pakistan during 2010 and 2011 by Oxfam and partner organisations.  The project’s overall objective was to mitigate the negative effects of food price volatility on vulnerable households, by supporting agricultural production and improving access to safety nets and by building local-level institutional capacity to support positive resilience.  Activities included providing direct support to households in the form of agricultural inputs and technical support in crop and dairy production.  Seed fairs and grain banks were established at a community level to provide access both to good-quality seeds and (in times of crisis) to grain as a food stock.  The project also facilitated the creation of village-level Farmer Organisations and Producer Organisations to provide a platform for producers to work together and improve their productivity while investing in new technology or joint marketing of their produce.  Two years after implementation ended, Oxfam conducted a household survey to evaluate the success of the project. A questionnaire was administered in 287 households of project participants and 500 comparison households from villages with characteristics similar to those from where the participants were selected. Quasi-experimental methods were used to evaluate the impact of the project by matching project beneficiaries with non-beneficiaries on a range of characteristics.  

Anonymisation:
Community names and union council names have been removed and replaced with codes in random order.  The following variables have been recoded so as to prevent unique cases that may allow identification of the respondents: household size (capped at 15 members), age (binned in 5-year intervals), religion (combined categories), size of land (grouped into intervals and capped), size of house (capped at 4+ rooms) and visible characteristics of house (combined categories of wall material).

Under this framework, a small number of completed or mature projects are selected at random each year for an evaluation of their impact, known as an Effectiveness Review. These data were used to evaluate the impact of the project titled 'Enhancing food security and resilience of small farmers in Pakistan'. The project was carried out in three districts of southern Pakistan during 2010 and 2011 by Oxfam and partner organisations.  The project’s overall objective was to mitigate the negative effects of food price volatility on vulnerable households, by supporting agricultural production and improving access to safety nets and by building local-level institutional capacity to support positive resilience.  Activities included providing direct support to households in the form of agricultural inputs and technical support in crop and dairy production.  Seed fairs and grain banks were established at a community level to provide access both to good-quality seeds and (in times of crisis) to grain as a food stock.  The project also facilitated the creation of village-level Farmer Organisations and Producer Organisations to provide a platform for producers to work together and improve their productivity while investing in new technology or joint marketing of their produce.  Two years after implementation ended, Oxfam conducted a household survey to evaluate the success of the project.
