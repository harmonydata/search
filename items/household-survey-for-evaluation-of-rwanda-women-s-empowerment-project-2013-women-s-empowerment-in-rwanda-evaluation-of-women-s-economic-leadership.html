</title><meta name="description" content="The Household Survey for Evaluation of Rwanda Women’s Empowerment Project, 2013 data were collected by Oxfam GB as part of the organisation&#x27;s Global Performance Framework.  Under this framework, a small number of completed or mature projects are selected at random each year for an evaluation of their impact, known as an Effectiveness Review.  This data was used to evaluate the impact of the &#x27;Women&#x27;s Economic Leadership through Horticulture Material-Planting Business&#x27; project in Rwanda, which was implemented in four districts of Rwanda between August 2011 and March 2014 by Oxfam and a local partner.  The project aimed to strengthen women&#x27;s capacity for engaging in the production of pineapple planting material, and thereby to enhance women’s socio-economic status at household and community level.  Among the key project activities was the provision of training and mentorship in improved agricultural planting-material techniques and business development.  Women were also trained in cross-cutting issues, such as HIV/AIDS and gender promotion.  In addition to these activities, the project aimed to improve women farmers&#x27; access to credit through microfinance.  The data collection for the evaluation took place in March 2014 in two of the participating districts.  All 216 women who participated in the project in these districts were targeted for the survey, though 188 were actually located and interviewed.  For comparison purposes, 415 women were selected at random from nearby villages where the project had not been implemented.  The evaluation adopted a quasi-experimental approach to compare between participant and comparison women, to assess the impact of the project on women’s empowerment.

Anonymisation:
Names of villages have been dropped from the dataset. The following variables have been recoded so as to prevent unique cases that may allow identification of the respondents:  household size (capped at 10), the age of household members (grouped by 5-year intervals), principal job of respondent and household head (combined categories), and materials of roof and floor of house (combined categories). Data concerning a respondent&#x27;s experience with gender-based violence have been removed, as these data are particularly sensitive.

This data was used to evaluate the impact of the 'Women's Economic Leadership through Horticulture Material-Planting Business' project in Rwanda, which was implemented in four districts of Rwanda between August 2011 and March 2014 by Oxfam and a local partner.  The project aimed to strengthen women's capacity for engaging in the production of pineapple planting material, and thereby to enhance women’s socio-economic status at household and community level.  Among the key project activities was the provision of training and mentorship in improved agricultural planting-material techniques and business development.  Women were also trained in cross-cutting issues, such as HIV/AIDS and gender promotion.  In addition to these activities, the project aimed to improve women farmers' access to credit through microfinance.  The data collection for the evaluation took place in March 2014 in two of the participating districts.  All 216 women who participated in the project in these districts were targeted for the survey, though 188 were actually located and interviewed.
