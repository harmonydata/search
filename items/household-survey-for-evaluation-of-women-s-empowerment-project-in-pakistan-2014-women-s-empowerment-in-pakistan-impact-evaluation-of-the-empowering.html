Under this framework, a small number of completed or mature projects are selected at random each year for an evaluation of their impact, known as an Effectiveness Review. These data were collected by Oxfam to evaluate the project &#x27;Empowering Small Producers, especially Women, in the Dairy Sector&#x27;, which was implemented in the Muzaffargarh district of Pakistan between 2011 and 2014 by Oxfam and another partner organisation.  The overall objective of the project was to improve livelihoods and opportunities, increasing income and employment, as well as raising women&#x27;s empowerment by improving their economic leadership in the dairy sector. The project activities included the formation of one enterprise in the dairy sector and the establishment of ten collection centres where farmers could sell their milk.  Activities also included the formation of ten community groups that provided training on milk production, animal health and the dairy market.  Half of the direct project participants and half of the members in the enterprise board were women. The review adopted a quasi-experimental impact evaluation design aimed at comparing women that had been supported by the project with women in neighbouring communities that had similar characteristics in 2010.  A household survey was carried out in December 2014 with 300 women participants and 500 comparison women.

Anonymisation:
The following variables have been recoded so as to prevent unique cases that may allow identification of the respondents: household size (capped at 16), marital status (combined categories), material of roof (combined categories) and age of household members (grouped by 5-year intervals).  The total number of children of a respondent was capped at 11, and the age of the oldest child of respondent was capped in the category &quot;41 and up&quot;. Village-level names have been removed, and union councils have been recoded in random order.  Data concerning a respondent&#x27;s experience with gender-based violence have been removed, as these data are particularly sensitive.

These data were collected by Oxfam to evaluate the project 'Empowering Small Producers, especially Women, in the Dairy Sector', which was implemented in the Muzaffargarh district of Pakistan between 2011 and 2014 by Oxfam and another partner organisation.  The overall objective of the project was to improve livelihoods and opportunities, increasing income and employment, as well as raising women's empowerment by improving their economic leadership in the dairy sector. The project activities included the formation of one enterprise in the dairy sector and the establishment of ten collection centres where farmers could sell their milk.  Activities also included the formation of ten community groups that provided training on milk production, animal health and the dairy market.  Half of the direct project participants and half of the members in the enterprise board were women. The review adopted a quasi-experimental impact evaluation design aimed at comparing women that had been supported by the project with women in neighbouring communities that had similar characteristics in 2010.
