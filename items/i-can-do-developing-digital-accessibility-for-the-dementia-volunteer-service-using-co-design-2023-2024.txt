The IDoService offers such a novel and innovative programme. It supports people with a recent diagnosis of dementia in identifying, participating and contributing to social activities in their community by connecting them to local volunteer services. The Service is built around a core 3-session plan, delivered by the wellbeing mentor, which allows people to explore their strengths and interests, get to know what is available locally and to decide what they want to do in a safe and convivial way. We have successfully trialled the service with Age UK Salford in 2022. We propose now to develop an interactive digital version to make it more user-friendly and easily scalable.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"I-Can-Do : Developing Digital Accessibility for the Dementia Volunteer Service using Co-Design, 2023-2024"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"I-Can-Do : Developing Digital Accessibility for the Dementia Volunteer Service using Co-Design, 2023-2024"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/i-can-do-developing-digital-accessibility-for-the-dementia-volunteer-service-using-co-design-2023-2024"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"I-Can-Do : Developing Digital Accessibility for the Dementia Volunteer Service using Co-Design, 2023-2024"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"I-Can-Do : Developing Digital Accessibility for the Dementia Volunteer Service using Co-Design, 2023-2024"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
