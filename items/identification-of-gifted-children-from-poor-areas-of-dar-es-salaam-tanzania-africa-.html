All children in class 4 and 5 took part (after gaining permissions and following ethical procedures) and the data set constitutes 1,857 pupils. These data are all within the SPSS spreadsheet which contains all of the quantitative data that were collected on these 1,857 children. This includes family background information (mother and father education, occupations, dwelling information etc), data about the child (age, gender, number of siblings etc.), test scores and thoughts around giftedness. The spreadsheet also contains data on their teacher and their school (i.e., teacher age, gender, qualifications etc., school size, fees, facilities etc.).

24 semi structured interviews were carried out with teachers from the 17 government primary schools that participated in the project. These interviews were carried out as the children were undertaking their surveys. The teachers were asked to give views, thoughts and attitudes around gifted and talented children not only in their school and classes but from a Tanzanian context. They were asked to give their opinions and thoughts about children from low income backgrounds as well as different genders. The teachers also gave comments about how children with talent are viewed and catered for currently within these school settings. 

This project has four objectives. The first considers the identification of high ability children attending schools in slums of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Objective one studies the current identification process within 50-60 schools with children in grade four and five. Teachers will be asked to identify children they believe are high ability providing reasons why. It will be observed whether the current identification process is biased towards any particular gender or cultural norms. All grade four and five children in around 20 schools will be given a battery of standard tests utilised to identify gifted-ness along with English, mathematics and Kiswahili tests. A comparison will be carried out looking for any correlations between those identified by the schools, parents, peers and communities, and those by the tests. Other questions explored will include children’s self-perception of their own ‘ability’. Objective two considers the creation of an accurate/cost-efficient identification process for teachers and school managers, enabling them to effectively identify high ability children. The third investigates the possibility of enriching and accelerating learning by designing and developing a framework for running a “Saturday Scholar Program”. The final part is the dissemination of the findings to educators, policy makers, governments, opinion formers, and relevant stakeholders."/><meta property="og:title" content="The identification of gifted children from poor areas of Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, Africa.

These interviews were carried out as the children were undertaking their surveys. The teachers were asked to give views, thoughts and attitudes around gifted and talented children not only in their school and classes but from a Tanzanian context. They were asked to give their opinions and thoughts about children from low income backgrounds as well as different genders.

Objective one studies the current identification process within 50-60 schools with children in grade four and five. Teachers will be asked to identify children they believe are high ability providing reasons why. It will be observed whether the current identification process is biased towards any particular gender or cultural norms. All grade four and five children in around 20 schools will be given a battery of standard tests utilised to identify gifted-ness along with English, mathematics and Kiswahili tests. A comparison will be carried out looking for any correlations between those identified by the schools, parents, peers and communities, and those by the tests. Other questions explored will include children’s self-perception of their own ‘ability’. Objective two considers the creation of an accurate/cost-efficient identification process for teachers and school managers, enabling them to effectively identify high ability children. The third investigates the possibility of enriching and accelerating learning by designing and developing a framework for running a “Saturday Scholar Program”.
