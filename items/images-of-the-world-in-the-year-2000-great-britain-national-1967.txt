The following is added:
Aspects of British foreign policy are considered, for example, whether she should join the Common Market and if she does, whether she should retain the right to decide her own internal affairs. Respondent opinion is also ascertained on the general type of foreign policy he would like to see Britain pursue (e.g. whether there are any countries the respondent feels Britain should have no contact with). Factors influencing the formation of foreign policy are considered together with the role of the United Nations (particularly whether the UN should have the power to intervene between Britain and some other country, whether the UN should have the power to intervene in British internal affairs).
Disarmament: views on disarmament and how this should be achieved are recorded, (i.e. whether all weapons should be abolished at the same time, whether disarmament is easy/hard to achieve etc.).
Military alliances and political tension: the country, or group of countries, the respondent feels is mainly responsible for the political tension in the world today is noted, together with whether he sees the military forces of the Soviet Union and the socialist powers as a threat, and whether he thinks that NATO is seen by other countries as a threat. He is also asked to state which of the Eastern and Western military powers he considers to be the strongest in Europe, to list the factors that he considers to have been of importance in bringing about a relaxation of tension in Europe, and to generally assess the trends in the relations between Eastern and Western European nations.
The following data are recorded for the respondent's childhood home: place of residence, household composition (at the age of 14 years), father's occupational details, whether mother worked outside the home, age at which respondent moved away from parental home, number of times parents moved district (up until the age of 14 years), political interest in the home (and whether respondent now tends to agree or disagree with his parents' political views).
Background Variables
Age, sex, marital status, social grade, number of children respondent expects to have, educational achievements, number of years full-time education received, occupational details (including the number of years in present occupation, job satisfaction, respondent's ideal job in the year 2000), occupational details of the head of household (if different), personal monthly income, household monthly income, place of residence, length of residence, religious belief, political and religious organisational membership, whether respondent was required to do military service, whether he, or any member of his family, was actively involved in or directly affected by, the second world war, finally, the respondent's voting intention, were there a general election tomorrow, is recorded, and whether he has ever voted differently.18:Tfb4,This inquiry into the views of the year 2000 held by the younger generation took place under the auspices of the European Coordination Centre for Research and Documentation in the Social Sciences, established at Vienna, which was founded by UNESCO and which is a division of the International Social Science Council at Paris. The technical coordination was in the hands of the International Peace Research Institute, Oslo, under the direction of Johan Galtung.
The objective of the inquiry was to examine attitudes of people in the age group 15 - 40 years towards various aspects of the future, with particular reference to war, peace and disarmament. The great attractiveness of such an inquiry lies in comparing the results of countries with very different political and philosophical backgrounds. Eleven countries are covered by this study.  Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
The section in the standard questionnaire (para 2 ) on predictions of social change in respondent's native country is excluded in the British version, the emphasis being more particularly on international relations and politics.
