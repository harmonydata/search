The technical coordination was in the hands of the International Peace Research Institute, Oslo, under the direction of Johan Galtung.
The objective of the inquiry was to examine attitudes of people in the age group 15 - 40 years towards various aspects of the future, with particular reference to war, peace and disarmament. The great attractiveness of such an inquiry lies in comparing the results of countries with very different political and philosophical backgrounds. Eleven countries are covered by this study.  Variables
As for the standard questionnaire with the following amendments:
Japanese respondent knowledge of NATO and the Warsaw Pact membership is not tested.
The following sections are added:
Nuclear armament: respondent assessment of Japanese technological, economic and industrial capability to produce nuclear arms: a) at present b) in the year 2000 is given. The respondent is also asked to predict when Japan is most likely to have nuclear arms (i.e. 1970&#x27;s, 1980&#x27;s etc.) - reason for this prediction is given. Respondent assessment of the trends in support for Japanese nuclear armament is recorded, and finally, he is asked to predict which he considers will be the sixth and seventh countries to go nuclear.
Domestic policy: the kind of policy respondent would like to see the Japanese government emphasize for the next ten years (taking account of Japan in the year 2000) is given. Employment and leisure: the respondent is asked to give his opinion of the two most important conditions of an ideal job (10 categories, e.g. &#x27;high income&#x27;, &#x27;short working time&#x27; etc.). Respondent prediction is ascertained on the most popular industry in the year 2000, and the way most people will spend their leisure time. He is also asked what kind of additional education he would prefer to receive were he now given the chance (e.g. general, special professional, for hobby and daily life etc.).
More generally, the most important things the respondent would like to accomplish by the year 2000 are noted (included is for whom he would like to accomplish these things - e.g. spouse, ancestor, emperor, working people etc.).
