The CDPs were action-research projects in the 1970s designed to tackle poverty. Interviewees included people who were activists, community workers, researchers and policy makers in the 1970s.

These connections take many forms, but often include people coming together to seek change and pursue a different future. We were interested in the role imagination plays in how such futures are conceived and pursued. The history of people's involvement in community initiatives includes both successful innovation and frustration and disappointment, in the UK and elsewhere. Our project learns from both scenarios. We studied community connections in different types of community (some present, some past). Using our new knowledge, together we have begun to imagine how communities might be different and to experiment with different forms of community building.\nCommunities are made up of people who share some things in common, but also have differences. In the light of this, we asked four main questions: 1) What are the best ways of conceptualising, researching and promoting connected communities so that they have the potential to accommodate and benefit from social, cultural and economic differences and diverse opinions and practices? 2) What does the history of civic engagement tell us about how and why the social, historical, cultural and democratic context matters to community-building? 3) What role can imagining better futures play in capturing and sustaining enthusiasm and momentum for change? 4) Is community research being transformed by developments in research methodologies, particularly the development of creative and collaborative methods?\nOur approach to these questions challenges ideas of community that focus on what is lacking, highlighting instead the role that harnessing imagination plays in shaping community futures. The project brought together researchers from a range of disciplines across the social sciences and arts and humanities interested in community relationships together with partner organisations dedicated to community development in a range of locations. \nThe projects employed a range of approaches to research, but with collaborative and participatory methods (community partners and universities working together) being central.

The motivating context of this project was a strong impetus globally towards people looking for new ways to participate in decision-making about issues that affect their lives, and to participate in research that involves them - the so-called 'democratisation of social research'. The various strands of research were held together by the team's shared interests in how people envisage co-operating and how these ideas get put into practice in diverse communities.

These connections take many forms, but often include people coming together to seek change and pursue a different future. We were interested in the role imagination plays in how such futures are conceived and pursued. The history of people's involvement in community initiatives includes both successful innovation and frustration and disappointment, in the UK and elsewhere. Our project learns from both scenarios. We studied community connections in different types of community (some present, some past). Using our new knowledge, together we have begun to imagine how communities might be different and to experiment with different forms of community building.
Communities are made up of people who share some things in common, but also have differences. In the light of this, we asked four main questions: 1) What are the best ways of conceptualising, researching and promoting connected communities so that they have the potential to accommodate and benefit from social, cultural and economic differences and diverse opinions and practices? 2) What does the history of civic engagement tell us about how and why the social, historical, cultural and democratic context matters to community-building? 3) What role can imagining better futures play in capturing and sustaining enthusiasm and momentum for change? 4) Is community research being transformed by developments in research methodologies, particularly the development of creative and collaborative methods?
Our approach to these questions challenges ideas of community that focus on what is lacking, highlighting instead the role that harnessing imagination plays in shaping community futures. The project brought together researchers from a range of disciplines across the social sciences and arts and humanities interested in community relationships together with partner organisations dedicated to community development in a range of locations. 
The projects employed a range of approaches to research, but with collaborative and participatory methods (community partners and universities working together) being central. Several projects involved going back to sites of previous research to explore what can be learned that is of relevance to to-day's debates about community. We returned to sites of the Community Development Projects of the 1970s, where research included analysis of background statistics, documentary records, interviews, oral history, community arts and other community-based activities, tracing that history and its legacies down to the present. We revisited culture and arts projects, and projects working with disadvantaged groups, all of which have sought to promote community resilience.
Reflections on the lessons of these experiences fed into interventions with members of 'disadvantaged' communities to fire imagination about the future and help to build resilience and a momentum for change. The motivating context of this project was a strong impetus globally towards people looking for new ways to participate in decision-making about issues that affect their lives, and to participate in research that involves them - the so-called 'democratisation of social research'. The various strands of research were held together by the team's shared interests in how people envisage co-operating and how these ideas get put into practice in diverse communities. Answering these questions required collaborative effort to look at a range of different cases, both past and present, and to draw appropriate conclusions to inform current debates and visions of the future.1d:["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:description","content":"$2c"}]

2d:T10f3,This data set comprises of 17 interview transcripts, which relate to interviews with 14 people who have worked, or are currently (2014-2016) working, in the field of community development and civic participation on Tyneside. Data was collected  between 2014-2016 as part of the cultural work package (WP2) of the Imagine Project North East. 
‘Imagine North East’ explored aspects of civic participation in the former Community Development Project (CDP) areas in Benwell (Newcastle) and North Shields. The CDPs were action-research projects in the 1970s designed to tackle poverty. Interviewees included people who were activists, community workers, researchers and policy makers in the 1970s. Our research looked at how communities connect people, both today and in the past. These connections take many forms, but often include people coming together to seek change and pursue a different future.
