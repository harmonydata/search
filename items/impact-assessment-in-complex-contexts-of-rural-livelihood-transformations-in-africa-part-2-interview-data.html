Part 2- Interview data</title><meta name="description" content="Qualitative interview resulting from semi-structured household
interviews and focus group discussions that aimed to assess the impact of development activities that are intended to benefit poor men, women and children; and how their income and food security is changing. The study took place in four rural village sites: Masumbankhunda and Karonga areas in Malawi and Tigray and Oromia areas in Ethiopia.How can the impact of development activities intended to benefit poor men, women and children caught up in complex processes of rural transformation best be assessed?

The research set out to develop and evaluate a protocol for impact assessment based on self-reported attribution without the use of comparison groups as an alternative to experimental or quasi-experimental designs based on statistically inferred attribution.

The three year project, starting in September 2012, was led by James Copestake at the University of Bath, and conducted in collaboration with three NGOs - Self Help Africa, Farm Africa, and Evidence for Development. It was jointly funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and Department for International Development DFID. The research has three strands that applied to four projects: two in Ethiopia and two in Malawi

Strand 1 comprises a baseline and two rounds of annual monitoring of food security and income at the household level by NGO staff.

Strand 2 comprises two rounds of annual in-depth interviewing to elicit self-reported attribution from intended project beneficiaries.

Strand 3 comprises two rounds of qualitative evaluation of what Strand 2 added to the understanding of project stakeholders."/><meta property="og:title" content="Impact assessment in complex contexts of rural livelihood transformations in Africa.
