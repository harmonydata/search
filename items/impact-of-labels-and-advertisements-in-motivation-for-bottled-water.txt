Previous research has shown that the degree to which drinks are thought of in terms of consuming and enjoying them (i.e., simulations) predicts intake. Here, we examined whether water labels or advertisements framed in terms of consumption and reward simulations increases motivation for a fictitious bottled water. In three pre-registered experiments with regular consumers of SSBs (N = 1355), we presented numerous different labels of fictitious water brands with words related to the rewarding consumption experience of water (e.g., “refreshing”, “cool”), with conventional descriptions of water that emphasised its origin and purity, or with brand names only. Contrary to our expectations, waters with consumption and reward-focused labels were not rated more favourably than waters with conventional labels, but both were rated higher than brand-only labels. \n In three additional online experiments (Nexp1 = 984; Nexp2 = 786), participants immersed themselves in situations shown in advertisements that highlighted the rewarding consumption experience of water (e.g., “refresh all your senses with this smooth, cool water”), health consequences of drinking water (e.g., “this water takes care of your health”), or control advertisements. We assessed participants’ descriptions of the bottled water with a Feature Listing task. Responses were coded for features related to consumption and reward, and positive long-term health consequences. We also measured ratings of attractiveness (Exp. 1), desire, and Willingness To Pay (WTP; Exp. 1 and 2). Simulation-enhanced advertisements increased the number of consumption and reward features, and health-focused advertisements increased the number of health features mentioned. Moreover, significant indirect effects showed that simulation-enhanced advertisements increased attractiveness (Exp. 1), desire, and WTP (Exp. 1 and 2) through an increase in consumption and reward features, whereas health-focused advertisements increased these ratings through an increase in health features. The effect through consumption and reward was stronger.What is the motivation for consuming sugary drinks? Why do some people choose Coke, and others water, to accompany their dinner or to quench their thirst? We know very little about the psychological processes underlying these behaviours. While the motivation for unhealthy food has been researched extensively, the motivation for sugary drinks remains understudied, despite their negative health implications. Up to 19% of daily calorie intake consists of sugar from drinks, and the consumption of sugary drinks contributes to weight gain. The consumption of sugary drinks is a main contributor to poor dental health and to overweight, which cost the NHS £ 3.4 billon and £ 4.7 billion a year in England alone (Public Health England, 2014).

In other words, when people see or think about a sugary drink, they spontaneously simulate (i.e., re-experience) the sensation and the reward of consuming it, such as its taste, the resulting energy boost, and the quenching of thirst, based on their previous, rewarding experiences. These simulations trigger a desire to consume sugary drinks, particularly when feeling thirsty.

Although evidence exists for the role of such simulations in the motivation for food, no previous studies have applied this account to drinks. Our research will first systematically test this simulation account of the motivation for sugary drinks, and then use it to stimulate healthier choices in innovative ways. 
 
 In Subproject 1, we will investigate the specific simulations that are triggered by sugary drinks and by water. Building on recent pilot data that we have collected, we expect that sugary drinks will trigger more consumption and reward simulations ("cold", "fizzy", "tasty", "refreshing") than water, particularly among high consumers of sugary drinks, and particularly when thirsty. In Subproject 2, we will link these consumption and reward simulations to the motivation to consume sugary drinks and water. To this end, we will use a novel method to assess motivation unobtrusively: we will measure the degree to which participants slightly lean forward on a Wii balance board when viewing images of drinks.10:{"metadata":[["$","title","0",{"children":"The Impact of Labels and Advertisements in Motivation for Bottled Water"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"$1b"}],"$L1c","$L1d","$L1e","$L1f","$L20","$L21","$L22","$L23","$L24","$L25","$L26","$L27","$L28","$L29","$L2a","$L2b"],"error":null,"digest":"$undefined"}

2c:T12c5,Consumers’ daily water consumption remains below the recommend level. Previous research has shown that the degree to which drinks are thought of in terms of consuming and enjoying them (i.e., simulations) predicts intake. Here, we examined whether water labels or advertisements framed in terms of consumption and reward simulations increases motivation for a fictitious bottled water. In three pre-registered experiments with regular consumers of SSBs (N = 1355), we presented numerous different labels of fictitious water brands with words related to the rewarding consumption experience of water (e.g., “refreshing”, “cool”), with conventional descriptions of water that emphasised its origin and purity, or with brand names only. Contrary to our expectations, waters with consumption and reward-focused labels were not rated more favourably than waters with conventional labels, but both were rated higher than brand-only labels. 
 In three additional online experiments (Nexp1 = 984; Nexp2 = 786), participants immersed themselves in situations shown in advertisements that highlighted the rewarding consumption experience of water (e.g., “refresh all your senses with this smooth, cool water”), health consequences of drinking water (e.g., “this water takes care of your health”), or control advertisements. We assessed participants’ descriptions of the bottled water with a Feature Listing task. Responses were coded for features related to consumption and reward, and positive long-term health consequences. We also measured ratings of attractiveness (Exp. 1), desire, and Willingness To Pay (WTP; Exp. 1 and 2). Simulation-enhanced advertisements increased the number of consumption and reward features, and health-focused advertisements increased the number of health features mentioned. Moreover, significant indirect effects showed that simulation-enhanced advertisements increased attractiveness (Exp. 1), desire, and WTP (Exp. 1 and 2) through an increase in consumption and reward features, whereas health-focused advertisements increased these ratings through an increase in health features. The effect through consumption and reward was stronger.What is the motivation for consuming sugary drinks? Why do some people choose Coke, and others water, to accompany their dinner or to quench their thirst? We know very little about the psychological processes underlying these behaviours. While the motivation for unhealthy food has been researched extensively, the motivation for sugary drinks remains understudied, despite their negative health implications. Up to 19% of daily calorie intake consists of sugar from drinks, and the consumption of sugary drinks contributes to weight gain. The consumption of sugary drinks is a main contributor to poor dental health and to overweight, which cost the NHS £ 3.4 billon and £ 4.7 billion a year in England alone (Public Health England, 2014). Especially given the recent media attention, many consumers are aware of the health implications of sugary drinks, but struggle to successfully reduce their intake. Therefore, it is important to understand what underlies the motivation for sugary drinks, and how we can effectively assist consumers in replacing sugary drinks with healthier alternatives such as water.
 
 We propose that sugary drinks gain their attractiveness through consumption and reward simulations. In other words, when people see or think about a sugary drink, they spontaneously simulate (i.e., re-experience) the sensation and the reward of consuming it, such as its taste, the resulting energy boost, and the quenching of thirst, based on their previous, rewarding experiences. These simulations trigger a desire to consume sugary drinks, particularly when feeling thirsty. Although evidence exists for the role of such simulations in the motivation for food, no previous studies have applied this account to drinks. Our research will first systematically test this simulation account of the motivation for sugary drinks, and then use it to stimulate healthier choices in innovative ways.
