We measured skin conductance responses, expectancy ratings and avoidant behaviour during an associative threat learning and avoidance task. To assess social anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty and trait anxiety, we administered the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) (Connor, Davidson, Churchill, Sherwood, Foa, & Weisler), The Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS) (Freeton, Rhéaume, Letarte, Dugas, & Ladouceur, 1994) and the trait version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg & Jacobs, 1968). The experimental task included four phases; threat acquisition, avoidance conditioning, avoidance test, and threat extinction. All participants completed all four phases. The study used a between subjects design and participants were allocated to one of two conditions: “instruction” and “control”. Participants in the instruction condition received the following instruction between the avoidance conditioning and avoidance test phases of the task: “Please press the non-avoidance button to test your expectancy whether an electrical stimulus and statement will occur”. At the same timepoint, the control group saw the following message “you may take a short break and continue when you are ready”. There were no other differences between the “instruction” and “control” conditions.In the UK, anxiety disorders affect over eight million people and cost the economy approximately £10 billion a year (McCrone et al., 2008). Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the most common anxiety disorder, except for specific phobia (Ruscio et al., 2008), and is characterised by excessive fear and avoidance of social or performance situations. SAD typically develops during late childhood or adolescence and therefore has a significant impact on a large number of young people, as well as adults (Beesdo et al., 2007; Detweiler et al., 2014; Stein et al., 2017). Further, some level of social anxiety is experienced by most humans at some point in their lives, for example when attending a job interview or having to give a presentation. People who suffer from social anxiety symptoms report poorer life satisfaction, physical health, mental health and have more clinical complaints and disabilities compared to people with lower social anxiety symptoms, even if they do not qualify for a diagnosis (Fehm et al., 2008). Therefore, the number of people severely affected by social anxiety may in fact be higher than current estimates of the disorder indicate (Jefferies & Ungar, 2020). \n\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is used for the treatment of SAD and includes exposure therapy as a main component. Exposure therapy for social anxiety includes face-to-face and imagined encounters with feared social situations, for example, starting a conversation or attending a social event, with the help of a Clinical Psychologist. Exposure to these social situations provide the patient with the opportunity to learn that the feared social situation will not always pose a threat. As the patient learns this information, they generate \"safety\" associations and social anxiety declines. However, treatment for SAD is often not successful. Many patients still experience symptoms or a return of fear after treatment. This suggests that there is room for improvement in the treatment of SAD. Laboratory-based research on safety learning, for example learning that something that was once threatening is now safe within an experimental task, can be carried out by researchers to further understanding of why fear may be maintained or return after exposure for people with social anxiety. Findings from this research can be used to inform Clinical Psychologists of potential methods of improving treatment for SAD. Therefore, there is a need to encourage collaboration between laboratory-based researchers and Clinical Psychologists to gather new ideas that might improve treatment outcome for SAD.\n \nThis fellowship aims to maximise the potential of my laboratory-based research to bridge the gap between laboratory science and clinical practice. This project is important because it may help us to design ways to adapt exposure therapy for SAD that might lead to improved outcomes of treatment.

To assess social anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty and trait anxiety, we administered the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) (Connor, Davidson, Churchill, Sherwood, Foa, & Weisler), The Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS) (Freeton, Rhéaume, Letarte, Dugas, & Ladouceur, 1994) and the trait version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg & Jacobs, 1968). The experimental task included four phases; threat acquisition, avoidance conditioning, avoidance test, and threat extinction. All participants completed all four phases. The study used a between subjects design and participants were allocated to one of two conditions: “instruction” and “control”. Participants in the instruction condition received the following instruction between the avoidance conditioning and avoidance test phases of the task: “Please press the non-avoidance button to test your expectancy whether an electrical stimulus and statement will occur”. At the same timepoint, the control group saw the following message “you may take a short break and continue when you are ready”. There were no other differences between the “instruction” and “control” conditions.In the UK, anxiety disorders affect over eight million people and cost the economy approximately £10 billion a year (McCrone et al., 2008). Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the most common anxiety disorder, except for specific phobia (Ruscio et al., 2008), and is characterised by excessive fear and avoidance of social or performance situations. SAD typically develops during late childhood or adolescence and therefore has a significant impact on a large number of young people, as well as adults (Beesdo et al., 2007; Detweiler et al., 2014; Stein et al., 2017). Further, some level of social anxiety is experienced by most humans at some point in their lives, for example when attending a job interview or having to give a presentation. People who suffer from social anxiety symptoms report poorer life satisfaction, physical health, mental health and have more clinical complaints and disabilities compared to people with lower social anxiety symptoms, even if they do not qualify for a diagnosis (Fehm et al., 2008). Therefore, the number of people severely affected by social anxiety may in fact be higher than current estimates of the disorder indicate (Jefferies & Ungar, 2020). 

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is used for the treatment of SAD and includes exposure therapy as a main component. Exposure therapy for social anxiety includes face-to-face and imagined encounters with feared social situations, for example, starting a conversation or attending a social event, with the help of a Clinical Psychologist. Exposure to these social situations provide the patient with the opportunity to learn that the feared social situation will not always pose a threat. As the patient learns this information, they generate "safety" associations and social anxiety declines. However, treatment for SAD is often not successful. Many patients still experience symptoms or a return of fear after treatment. This suggests that there is room for improvement in the treatment of SAD. Laboratory-based research on safety learning, for example learning that something that was once threatening is now safe within an experimental task, can be carried out by researchers to further understanding of why fear may be maintained or return after exposure for people with social anxiety. Findings from this research can be used to inform Clinical Psychologists of potential methods of improving treatment for SAD. Therefore, there is a need to encourage collaboration between laboratory-based researchers and Clinical Psychologists to gather new ideas that might improve treatment outcome for SAD.
 
This fellowship aims to maximise the potential of my laboratory-based research to bridge the gap between laboratory science and clinical practice. This project is important because it may help us to design ways to adapt exposure therapy for SAD that might lead to improved outcomes of treatment. The findings of my work are relevant for clinicians using exposure-based treatments for SAD, and this fellowship will provide the opportunity to gain clinical experience and foster connections with clinicians to maximise the societal impact of my work.1d:["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:description","content":"$2c"}]
