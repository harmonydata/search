These were decided by working with collaborating organisations of people with learning disabilities and family carers, policy-makers and other organisations across the UK.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on People with Learning Disabilities and Factors Associated with Better Outcomes, 2020-2021"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on People with Learning Disabilities and Factors Associated with Better Outcomes, 2020-2021"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/impact-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-people-with-learning-disabilities-and-factors-associated-with-better-outcomes-2020-2021"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on People with Learning Disabilities and Factors Associated with Better Outcomes, 2020-2021"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on People with Learning Disabilities and Factors Associated with Better Outcomes, 2020-2021"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
