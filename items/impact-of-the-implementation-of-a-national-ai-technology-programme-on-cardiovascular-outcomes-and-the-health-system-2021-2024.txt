The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends the use of FFRCT in a chest pain pathway. However, use of this new technology remains limited due to funding restrictions and uncertainty as to its benefit in the NHS. 
This study aims to determine the extent to which the new FFRCT technology is safe and reliable, provides a quicker time to diagnosis for the patient, reduces the need for further tests and thus represents good value to the NHS.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Impact of the Implementation of a National AI Technology Programme on Cardiovascular Outcomes and the Health System, 2021-2024"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Impact of the Implementation of a National AI Technology Programme on Cardiovascular Outcomes and the Health System, 2021-2024"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/impact-of-the-implementation-of-a-national-ai-technology-programme-on-cardiovascular-outcomes-and-the-health-system-2021-2024"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Impact of the Implementation of a National AI Technology Programme on Cardiovascular Outcomes and the Health System, 2021-2024"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Impact of the Implementation of a National AI Technology Programme on Cardiovascular Outcomes and the Health System, 2021-2024"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
