Healthcare data was used to determine clinical outcomes (heart attacks, death, cardiac death), procedures performed (invasive angiography, percutaneous stenting and surgical bypass grafting) and heart diagnostic tests up to 24 months following the index CCTA.  Costs are determined from the NHS national tariff system.Chest pain may be a symptom that is related to a narrowing of the heart blood vessels (coronary artery disease [CAD]). This chest pain, known as angina, can result in a reduced quality of life and, if not diagnosed and managed appropriately, could result in a heart attack. Coronary disease remains the largest cause of death in the United Kingdom today, with one death every 4 minutes. Guidelines recommend the use of tests to help diagnose and manage chest pain 'angina' patients. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is a test that takes images of the heart blood vessels. It is the main test for patients presenting with angina, as it is excellent at saying when the heart blood vessels are normal, and can be reassuring for patients. However, when narrowing's are present CCTA lacks the ability to tell whether they are causing the patient's symptoms. 
A new technology, CT-derived fractional flow reserve (FFRCT) uses the CCTA images to make a 3D model of the heart blood vessels that shows whether there is a limitation in the blood flow to the heart which is causing the symptoms. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends the use of FFRCT in a chest pain pathway. However, use of this new technology remains limited due to funding restrictions and uncertainty as to its benefit in the NHS. 
This study aims to determine the extent to which the new FFRCT technology is safe and reliable, provides a quicker time to diagnosis for the patient, reduces the need for further tests and thus represents good value to the NHS.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Impact of the Implementation of a National AI Technology Programme on Cardiovascular Outcomes and the Health System, 2021-2024"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Impact of the Implementation of a National AI Technology Programme on Cardiovascular Outcomes and the Health System, 2021-2024"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/impact-of-the-implementation-of-a-national-ai-technology-programme-on-cardiovascular-outcomes-and-the-health-system-2021-2024"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Impact of the Implementation of a National AI Technology Programme on Cardiovascular Outcomes and the Health System, 2021-2024"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Impact of the Implementation of a National AI Technology Programme on Cardiovascular Outcomes and the Health System, 2021-2024"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
