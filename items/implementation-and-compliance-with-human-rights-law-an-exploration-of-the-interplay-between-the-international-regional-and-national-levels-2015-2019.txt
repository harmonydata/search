The Open Society Justice Initiative (OSJI) has an enviable range of contacts across the three regions and at the UN and is considered one of the key civil society players in the human rights field. Together with Bristol coordinating the project and providing African expertise with Pretoria, Middlesex's European Human Rights Advocacy Centre inputting the European expertise and Essex's Human Rights Centre offering the Inter-American contribution, the project team are extremely well placed to combine the academic and practitioner background necessary to carry out this innovative and ambitious research. 
Through semi-structured interviews, participant observation, workshops and a range of published outputs directed at policy and academic audiences, this research attempted to get to the heart of the utility and relevance of human rights law in the 21st century, an issue which is concern to state actors (governments, legislatures and judiciaries); civil society actors; human rights bodies; and victims (and potential) victims of human rights violations.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Implementation and compliance with human rights law: An exploration of the interplay between the international, regional and national levels 2015-2019"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Implementation and compliance with human rights law: An exploration of the interplay between the international, regional and national levels 2015-2019"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/implementation-and-compliance-with-human-rights-law-an-exploration-of-the-interplay-between-the-international-regional-and-national-levels-2015-2019"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Implementation and compliance with human rights law: An exploration of the interplay between the international, regional and national levels 2015-2019"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Implementation and compliance with human rights law: An exploration of the interplay between the international, regional and national levels 2015-2019"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
