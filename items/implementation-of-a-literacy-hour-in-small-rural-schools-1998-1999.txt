to analyse ways in which teachers have attempted to overcome difficulties in implementation of the literacy hour and identify successful strategies.
The project consisted of detailed case studies from 20 classrooms, between September 1998 and July 1999. The study was designed to yield rich descriptive data to give a detailed picture of what was happening in classrooms in the first year of the NLS. This dataset forms part of a wider project which also comprised interviews with the class teacher at the beginning and end of the school year, and classroom observations and field notes of monthly observations of literacy hours in each classroom over eight months. The qualitative part of the project is not deposited at UKDA.  The dataset contains the results of reading tests administered to primary school pupils in small rural schools in the first year of said <i>National Literacy Strategy</i> (1998-1999). All pupils were in mixed-age classes containing two, three or four year groups. Reading tests were given to pupils in October 1998 and another test was given to the same pupils the following June. Reception pupils were given the same test again, but all other age groups were given a more advanced test within the same series in accordance with the published guidance. Progress scores have been calculated for each pupil by subtracting the October score from the June score on the reading tests. Pupils are listed together with details of their class and school (the data are anonymised). Variables include school, teacher, age and gender of pupil, number of pupils in the class and number of year groups in the class. 

Standard Measures
Four published standardised reading tests were used as appropriate for particular year groups:
1. In Reception (4-5 year olds) the 'Language and Reading Readiness Test of Emergent Literacy' (LARR) was used on both occasions.
2. In Key Stage 1 the 'Primary Reading Test' was used - in October as a word recognition test and in June as a comprehension test.
3. At Key Stage 2 the 'Test 8' was used in October and 'Test 9' in June for Years 3 and 4.
4. 'Progress in English (PIE) Test 10' was used in October, and 'Test 11' in June, for Years 5 and 6.27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2b"}]
