The research first explored, with teachers, strategies for training pupils in group-work skills, and enhancing the use of group work in school classrooms. This resulted in the development of a group work programme, which aimed to enhance pupil attainment, classroom behaviour, attitudes and motivation. This was systematically evaluated in relation to control data. The project aimed to promote a more considered approach to the use of group work within classes. The results allow teachers to adopt new approaches based on sound evidence of their effectiveness and consolidate and improve current uses of group work. Findings contribute to a country-wide bid to raise standards and to reduce pupil disengagement. By working closely with practitioners to identify the conditions in which such effects can be maximised, the findings contribute to practice, theory, and future government policy.
 The Key Stage 1 (KS1) data comprise: pre- and post-test attainment scores for mathematics and reading; Performance in Primary School (PIPS) tests, collected during 2002-3 and 2003-4; pre- and post-test attitudinal, personality and motivational data collected separately during the same time period; termly observational data for a sample of pupils.

The Key Stage 2 (KS2) data comprise two files. The first includes experimental and control group data - pupil, school and class teacher identifiers; pupil background information; school background information; pre- and post-test science attainment assessments of knowledge of evaporation and condensation; start and end of year (pre- and post-intervention) attitudinal and motivational data from questionnaires. Scales can be constructed from the data. The second file includes experimental and control group data - pupil, school and class teacher identifiers; pupil background information; and pupil classroom behavioural data from observations of a sample of pupils who completed the attitudinal and attainment tests.

The Key Stage 3 (KS3) data include: pre- and post-test attitudinal, personality and motivational data collected separately  over 2002-2003 and 2003-2004. Scales can be constructed from the data and gain measures employed. Also included are termly observational data of a sample of pupils who completed the attitudinal tests. Break-downs by year, gender and teacher-estimated achievement are possible. Numeric pupil identifiers allow the observational data to be linked to attitudinal data.

Standard Measures:
As noted above, Performance in Primary School (PIPS) test results for reading and mathematics were included in the KS1 data.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Improving the Effectiveness of Pupil Group Work in Primary and Secondary Schools, 2002-2004"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Improving the Effectiveness of Pupil Group Work in Primary and Secondary Schools, 2002-2004"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/improving-the-effectiveness-of-pupil-group-work-in-primary-and-secondary-schools-2002-2004"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Improving the Effectiveness of Pupil Group Work in Primary and Secondary Schools, 2002-2004"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Improving the Effectiveness of Pupil Group Work in Primary and Secondary Schools, 2002-2004"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
