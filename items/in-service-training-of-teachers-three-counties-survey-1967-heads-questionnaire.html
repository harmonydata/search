Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
This survey follows the general format of 67014, asking similar questions but with the orientation towards the needs of heads of schools.
After a general assessment of views held on current in-service training programmes, heads are asked to list the types of programmes and courses which have provided outstanding benefit to schools (with details), topics deemed important for future courses generally, and for each of three teacher groups (heads and responsible positions; part-timers, married women returners and late entrants; and other full-time teachers), method and teacher group priorities recommended for the future, and general experience of, and opinions on, full-time secondment in school time. A list of &#x27;solutions&#x27; to problems of secondment are placed in order of applicability and desirability (e.g. supply teachers, reorganization of schedules etc.), and heads&#x27; attitudes towards teachers after completion of courses are assessed (e.g. is promotion to be expected, should teaching methods automatically change, what is the maximum age of eligibility for secondment etc.).
Concerning information on in-service training courses, the head is asked for the most effective means of dissemination, and role of his personal discretion in such dissemination. A series of specific questions on methods used in current training programmes is followed by recommendations for priorities in the future, alternative schemes for dealing with scheduling problems of in-service training during school time, individual circumstances which stop head attending in-service training and his own personal history of programme completion (with details and dates). Willingness to participate in future courses on full-time secondment during vacations, in out-of school hours, and length of time which would be made available is elicited. A final question asks for a personal definition of `curriculum&#x27; and &#x27;teaching methods&#x27;. A discussion of any follow-up activities carried out in the particular school completed the substantive portion of the survey.
Background Variables
Age cohort, sex, full-time teaching experience, marital status, number of dependents, professional status, total number of years as head of school. The school is graded according to area within the county, sex and age of school population."/><meta property="og:title" content="In-Service Training of Teachers : Three Counties Survey, 1967; Heads&#x27; Questionnaire"/><meta property="og:description" content="The aim of this survey was to establish the views and needs of a representative sample of heads of schools in each of three counties concerning in-service training.

Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions\\nThis survey follows the general format of 67014, asking similar questions but with the orientation towards the needs of heads of schools.\\nAfter a general assessment of views held on current in-service training programmes, heads are asked to list the types of programmes and courses which have provided outstanding benefit to schools (with details), topics deemed important for future courses generally, and for each of three teacher groups (heads and responsible positions; part-timers, married women returners and late entrants; and other full-time teachers), method and teacher group priorities recommended for the future, and general experience of, and opinions on, full-time secondment in school time. A list of 'solutions' to problems of secondment are placed in order of applicability and desirability (e.g. supply teachers, reorganization of schedules etc.), and heads' attitudes towards teachers after completion of courses are assessed (e.g. is promotion to be expected, should teaching methods automatically change, what is the maximum age of eligibility for secondment etc.).\\nConcerning information on in-service training courses, the head is asked for the most effective means of dissemination, and role of his personal discretion in such dissemination. A series of specific questions on methods used in current training programmes is followed by recommendations for priorities in the future, alternative schemes for dealing with scheduling problems of in-service training during school time, individual circumstances which stop head attending in-service training and his own personal history of programme completion (with details and dates).
