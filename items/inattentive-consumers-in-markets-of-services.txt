If they had any doubts they could ask for clarification. The experiment involved individual choices where subjects had repeated opportunities to choose among a set of tariffs. There were 36 rounds. In each round subjects were asked to choose one among 24 different tariffs. Once they had chosen their preferred tariff they were asked to choose a consumption level for that tariff (5 levels of consumption  were allowed: 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 5000 units). Once they had done that, the earnings for that tariff and level of consumption were displayed on the screen. 
Revenues were exogenously given in a table for each level of consumption. The higher was the level of consumption the higher were the revenues. Costs depended on the tariff chosen and the level of consumption. The higher was the level of consumption the higher were the costs. Earnings were then calculated subtracting the costs from the revenues. The revenues for each level of consumption are presented in Table 1. They were such that for any tariff the optimal level of consumption was 4000 units.  In all treatments subjects were assigned a default tariff. They could either stick to that tariff or have a look at the other tariffs and change it if they wanted to. At the end of the experiment, one of the 36 tasks was chosen randomly and subjects were paid according to the choice made in that task.  Average earnings were around 20 pounds. The ESRC Centre for Competition Policy (CCP) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) undertakes interdisciplinary research into competition policy that has real-world policy relevance without compromising academic rigour.

It prides itself on the interdisciplinary nature of the research and the members are drawn from a range of disciplines, including economics, law, business and political science.

The Centre was established in September 2004, building on the pre-existing Centre for Competition and Regulation (CCR), with a grant from the ESRC (Economic and Social Research Council). It currently boasts a total of 17 faculty members (including the Director and a Political Science Mentor), 7 full- and part-time researchers and 14 PhD students.26:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2a"}]
