The remaining three files represent Gillian Autism Rating Scale scores for the pupils with ASD, a SENCO ASD provision audit, and questionnaire data on teacher attitudes, knowledge and understanding of ASD.

Qualitative data: Phase 1 - 37 pupil interview transcripts, plus two files containing qualitative data from open-ended questions in the teacher and SENCO quesitonnaires (see above). Phase 2 – 7 pupil diaries, 3 SENCO observations, 1 teaching assisant observation, 21 pupil observations, 4 SENCO interviews, 8 pupil interviews, 5 outside agency interviews, 24 teacher interviews, 17 teaching assistant interviews, 3 other support staff interviews, 2 peer group interviews and 1 parent interview
 The aim of the project was to examine the effectiveness of (and subsequently inform practice in) inclusive education for pupils with autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) in mainstream secondary schools.  The research yielded 2 datasets: (1) Profiles of Inclusion - this phase comprised a causal comparative investigation of inclusion profiles of 40 pupils with ASDs, 40 pupils with dyslexia, and 40 pupils with no identified SEN from 12 secondary schools. Triads of participants were matched on age, sex, school and (for pupils with ASD and dyslexia) stage of SEN provision.  'Profiles of inclusion' were developed for each participant, using self-report questionnaires (self-perceptions, perceptions of social support, experiences of bullying and victimization, and attitudes towards school), peer-report sociometric questionnaires (social inclusion), Structured observations (pupil-peer interaction in social settings, classroom learning environment and pupil participation and engagement in lessons) and parent-report questionnaires (attitudes towards inclusive education).  Additionally, school level data was collected using questionnaires for Special Educational Needs Co-coordinators (SENCO) (audit of school policy and practice relating to ASD) and teachers (attitudes towards and extent of inclusion within school). (2) Good Practice Case Studies - the data generated using the methods outlined above helped to answer key research questions, but also facilitated the selection of 4 exemplar case study schools whose good practice could then be explored and documented. The project RA spent approximately two months in each of the schools.  This facilitated a 'quasi-ethnographic' approach, wherein she was able to immerse herself in the life of the school.  In addition to various informal opportunities for data collection, formal data generation in each school comprised interviews with and diaries of pupils with ASD, interviews with class teachers, support staff, SENCo and senior management, participant observations in lessons and other settings (e.g. lunchtime, staff briefings), and interviews with parents of pupils with ASD.18:Tde2,This data collection consists of both qualitative and quantitative data. 
Quantitative data (all from Phase 1): there are 9 SPSS files.  6 of these files contain comparative data for 120 pupils (see section 3 above) pertaining to peer interaction at break and lunchtime, inclusion in lessons, peer group acceptance and rejection, self-reported indicators of inclusion (e.g. bullying, social support), teacher-rated emotional and behavioural difficulties, and background information (e.g. age, gender).  The remaining three files represent Gillian Autism Rating Scale scores for the pupils with ASD, a SENCO ASD provision audit, and questionnaire data on teacher attitudes, knowledge and understanding of ASD.  The number of variables in each file varies; in each case data is recorded at both the item and domain level (where applicable).  Descriptions of each variable are recorded in the ‘variable view’ tab.
