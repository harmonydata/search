More broadly, the project also aimed to evaluate the impacts of cannabis use (positive or negative) on quality of life, and to examine whether developments in detection/law enforcement (e.g. workplace drug testing) would influence patterns of use. To this end, 100 regular users of cannabis (two to seven days/week) and 90 infrequent users (at most, four days per month) returned detailed questionnaires covering demographic characteristics, patterns of use, and the effects of cannabis use on general well-being, work/academic performance, driving and sexual behaviour. Respondents were from cities, towns and villages throughout England. Sixty respondents (30 from each user group) were later interviewed in depth on related topics, with a particular focus on the impact of cannabis use on their relationships with parents/partners. Eight respondents who had given up using cannabis were also interviewed to gain insight into reasons for quitting.

This study uses a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methodology, and includes three quantitative data files (data from questionnaires and qualitative interviews) and one document comprising quotes from the interviews, available in Adobe PDF format. Topics covered in the questionnaire included: gender, ethnic group, educational background, qualifications, current and previous cannabis use, effects of cannabis use, motor vehicle ownership, alcohol use, other illegal drug use, general health and emotional state, economic activity, employment history, cannabis and work performance, cannabis and academic performance, cannabis and sexual behaviour.

Themes covered in the interviews included: context of first use and patterns of cannabis use from onset to present day, smoking behaviour, dependence, positive and negative effects of cannabis, effects of cannabis on personal relationships, effects of cannabis on work performance, effects of cannabis on academic performance and attitudes towards the legalisation of cannabis and whether or not respondents considered cannabis to be a &#x27;gateway drug&#x27; (i.e. leading to use of other drugs).
