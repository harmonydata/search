examine further the relationship between a survey and a more qualitative approach to these issues;
attempt to throw some light on the reliability of retrospective questions in this kind of study.  File dcs180.exp:
the schedule is divided into nine sections: A. Life History Update; B. Employment Update; C. Work; D. Retirement; E. Housing; F. Best/Worst Events in Life (Feelings/(in)security); G. Networks and Social Support; H. Resources; J. Ambitions and Plans.
In most sections, data were collected from both original respondents to the SCELI Household Survey (ORs) and their present partners (Ps) wherever possible. Some questions were asked of the ORs only and some were joint responses. Where separate responses from the ORs and their partners are available, they are coded as br... or  bp... respectively; otherwise they are coded as br... (where b stands for DCS to distinguish it from SCELI; r for OR and p for partner. The rest follows the sequence in Questionnaire Sections and Question Numbers of the schedule - see documentation for further details). Responses from unpartnered respondents are matched with those of the partnered and the variable names follow the sequence of question numbers of the couple schedule.

File dcssceli180.exp:
This is a merged file obtained by linking the data obtained in DCS to that obtained in SCELI for the same original respondents and relating to their partners at that time. For detailed information on the SCELI data, please see SCELI questionnaires and supporting documentation. These can be downloaded as the SCELI User Guide from the Data Archive web pages through BIRON (see SN:2798), or may be requested at the time of order for this dataset.
