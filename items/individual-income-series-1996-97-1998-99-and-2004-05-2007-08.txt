2a:T935,The Individual Income Series provides estimates of the individual income of women and men in Great Britain and changes in income over time. These provide a means of comparing the income accruing to women with that accruing to men, either directly or in their own right. Individual income estimates cover all adult women and men, whether living as couples or as single persons. The data are derived directly from the Family Resources Survey (FRS) (available at the UK Data Archive under GN 33283) and the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) (available at the Archive under SN 5828).

The Individual Income Series is distinct in that they seek to compare the incomes that accrue to women with those that accrue to men. This information complements data in other official statistics publications, which address different issues: HM Revenue and Customs' statistics cover only taxable income; certain other statistics cover only earned income; and other series such as the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) HBAI analyse household income.

The Individual Income Series does not provide a means of comparing the living standards of women and men, nor of different groups of women: the analyses take no account of the extent to which members of a household share their incomes or resources with other household members.

The National Equality Panel, set up by the Minister for Women and Equality in October 2008, was asked to look at the best available evidence on the relationship between inequality in economic outcomes and differences related to people's characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity and disability. One of the economic outcomes analysed by the Panel was individual income, received by each adult in their own right from all sources in total, before and after deducting direct taxes. The final report of the National Equality Panel, specifically chapter six, contains the analyses of the Individual Income Series,  and are available as part of the study documentation (see below). The data files used for this analysis form the data available as part of this study. Some additional tables are available on the Government Equalities Office Individual Incomes Statistical Annex web page.
