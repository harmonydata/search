It ensures that, should households find themselves in difficult circumstances, they will be shielded from extremely low living standards. However, the provision of social insurance also brings costs. These costs are both direct (e.g. the financial cost of the transfers) and indirect (e.g. the provision of benefits reduces the incentives to work and save). Balancing these costs and benefits is a\nchallenge for policy-makers.\n\nOur proposed research will develop and test models of household savings and labour supply to evaluate how reforms to social insurance schemes would impact household behaviour, household well-being, inequality and the public finances."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Inequality and the Insurance Value of Transfers across the Life Cycle: Secondary Analysis, 1958-2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$15\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"Inequality and the Insurance Value of Transfers across the Life Cycle: Secondary Analysis, 1958-2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"$16\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/inequality-and-the-insurance-value-of-transfers-across-the-life-cycle-secondary-analysis-1958-2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:site_name\",\"content\":\"Academic Resource Discovery\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:locale\",\"content\":\"en_US\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:image:width\",\"content\":\"1200\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:image:height\",\"content\":\"630\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"og:image:alt\",\"content\":\"Inequality and the Insurance Value of Transfers across the Life Cycle: Secondary Analysis, 1958-2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"website\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary_large_image\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"Inequality and the Insurance Value of Transfers across the Life Cycle: Secondary Analysis, 1958-2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$17\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"17\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]]\nc:null\n"])</script></body></html>
