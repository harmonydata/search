This social insurance is potentially valuable to all households, not just those receiving those benefits at a given point in time. It ensures that, should households find themselves in difficult circumstances, they will be shielded from extremely low living standards. However, the provision of social insurance also brings costs. These costs are both direct (e.g. the financial cost of the transfers) and indirect (e.g. the provision of benefits reduces the incentives to work and save). Balancing these costs and benefits is a
challenge for policy-makers.

Our proposed research will develop and test models of household savings and labour supply to evaluate how reforms to social insurance schemes would impact household behaviour, household well-being, inequality and the public finances.10:{"metadata":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Inequality and the Insurance Value of Transfers across the Life Cycle: Secondary Analysis, 1958-2020"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"$1c"}],"$L1d","$L1e","$L1f","$L20","$L21","$L22","$L23","$L24","$L25","$L26","$L27","$L28","$L29","$L2a","$L2b","$L2c"],"error":null,"digest":"$undefined"}

There was no primary data collected as part of the grant. The materials uploaded consist of code to reproduce analysis and open licence secondary data.

The inheritances_report consists of the dofile "MasterReplication.do" required to re-create the results of the report “Inheritances and inequality over the life cycle: what will they mean for younger generations?”. The data sources used are the End-user-license versions of the English Longitudinal Study of Aging and the ONS Wealth and Assets Survey data. These data are available to download from the UK Data Service Website. The only non-publicly available data used here are a series of estimates made using the Longitudinal Study and exported from the Secure Research Service (SRS).
