Details of what each of the flders contain are in the respective ReadMe files.The provision of 'social insurance' (the benefits governments pay to those who are ill, unemployed, disabled, poor or old), accounts for more government expenditure than any other category of public spending. This social insurance is potentially valuable to all households, not just those receiving those benefits at a given point in time. It ensures that, should households find themselves in difficult circumstances, they will be shielded from extremely low living standards. However, the provision of social insurance also brings costs. These costs are both direct (e.g. the financial cost of the transfers) and indirect (e.g. the provision of benefits reduces the incentives to work and save). Balancing these costs and benefits is a
challenge for policy-makers.

Our proposed research will develop and test models of household savings and labour supply to evaluate how reforms to social insurance schemes would impact household behaviour, household well-being, inequality and the public finances.17:T1138,The research aimed to develop and test models of household savings and labour supply to evaluate how reforms to social insurance schemes would impact household behaviour, household well-being, inequality and the public finances.
