establish the feeding practices in families for infants from birth to 15 months of age;
identify the reasons why babies are fed as they are, and determine what influences mothers to make their choices about infant feeding;
identify the sources and quality of information and support provided to mothers;
examine the growth of babies and relate this to feeding practices. 
Wave 5 data, made available in this second edition, were collected during the fifth stage of the survey. This fifth wave followed up the Asian children in the study when they were about 2 years old to:
evaluate the effect of diet on the development of anaemia in young Asian children;
explore the relationship between previous feeding history, current daylight exposure and vitamin D status;
assess the impact of infection (indicated by acute phase protein values) on indicators of iron status.

The UK Data Archive also holds a series of five-yearly Infant Feeding Surveys, 1985-, conducted using a wider sample across the United Kingdom, under GN 33251.
  Waves 1-4:
Topics covered by the data include:
Breastfeeding - incidence, prevalence and duration.
Choice of feeding method.
Bottle feeding - prevalence, type of non-human milk given, hygiene practices, help with cost of milk.
Ante-natal care and advice.
Feeding problems and sources of advice during first 15 months.
Solid food - age of introduction, type of food eaten and frequency, feeding problems.
Drinks - types of drinks other than milk, frequency of consumption of different types of drink.
Vitamin supplements given.
Body measurements - weight, supine length, head circumference, mid upper-arm circumference.
Wave 5:
The file for wave 5 contains:
Data from interviews with mothers covering: information on the child&#x27;s milk drinking habits; consumption of other food and drink which could influence iron status and vitamin D; consumption of vitamin supplements; exposure to sunlight; recent infection.
Results of analysis of a blood sample taken from the child at the time of the interview.
It is possible to carry forward other variables from waves 1-4 of the survey by matching serial number."/><meta property="og:title" content="Infant Feeding in Asian Families, 1994-1996; Waves 1-5"/><meta property="og:description" content="The survey aimed to:

mothers;\\nexamine the growth of babies and relate this to feeding practices. \\nWave 5 data, made available in this second edition, were collected during the fifth stage of the survey.
