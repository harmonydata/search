solid foods - age at introduction of solids, types of food given, influences on the choice of foods, preparing and feeding solid food and difficulties with weaning.1a:Td21,The Infant Feeding Survey (IFS) has been carried out every five years since 1975, in order to establish information about infant feeding practices. Government policy in the United Kingdom has consistently supported breastfeeding as the best way of ensuring a healthy start for infants and of promoting women's health.  Current guidance on infant feeding is as follows:breastmilk is the best form of nutrition for infants;exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for around the first six months (26 weeks) of an infant's life;infant formula is the only recommended alternative to breastfeeding for babies who are under 12 months old;around six months is the recommended age for the introduction of solid foods for infants, whether breastfed or fed on breastmilk substitutes;breastfeeding (and/or breastmilk substitutes) should continue beyond the first six months, along with appropriate types and amounts of solid foods;mothers who are unable to, or choose not to, follow these recommendations should be supported to optimise their infants' nutrition. Since the IFS began, the content of the survey has evolved to reflect the prevailing government policy agenda, while recognising the importance of maintaining consistency over time to allow comparison and trend analysis. The first IFS in 1975 took place in England and Wales only.  From 1980 the survey covered Scotland, while from 1990 Northern Ireland was also included.  The 2005 survey was the first to provide separate estimates for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well as for the UK as a whole, and to provide estimates of exclusive breast-feeding (where the baby is given only breast milk, no other liquids or solids).

Further information about the IFS series may be found on the Health and Social Care Information Centre website (search for 'Infant Feeding Survey').

The UK Data Archive holds IFS data from 1985 onwards. A separate survey, Infant Feeding in Asian Families, 1994-1996, covering England only, is held under SN 3759.

 The main aims of the 1995 survey were as follows:to establish how infants born in 1995 are being fed and to provide national figures on the incidence, prevalence and duration of breastfeeding;to examine trends in infant feeding practices over recent years, in particular since 1990;to investigate the factors associated with mothers' feeding intentions and with the feeding practices adopted in the early weeks;to establish the age at which solid foods are introduced and to examine weaning practices up to nine months.As in 1990, the survey involved approaching a sample of mothers when their babies were aged six to ten weeks, with follow-up questionnaires at four to five months and at nine months.

  The survey contains information on: 
breastfeeding;
antenatal care - check-ups, classes and home visits, folic acid and dietary supplements;
smoking and drinking during pregnancy;
choice of feeding method and reasons;
the birth and post-natal care, problems feeding the baby;
the use of non-human milk, help with the cost of milk;
feeding after the early weeks - problems and reasons for stopping breastfeeding;
feeding in public places;
additional drinks;
supplementary vitamins;
solid foods - age at introduction of solids, types of food given, influences on the choice of foods, preparing and feeding solid food and difficulties with weaning.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Infant Feeding Survey, 1995 / IFS"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Infant Feeding Survey, 1995 / IFS"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/infant-feeding-survey-1995-ifs"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Infant Feeding Survey, 1995 / IFS"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Infant Feeding Survey, 1995 / IFS"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
