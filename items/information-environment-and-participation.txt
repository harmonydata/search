The traditional media play a privileged role in informing citizens through their provision of news and current affairs programming. Contemporary developments in media and political structures, such as the expansion of commercial broadcasting and weakening of political partisanship, further elevate the role of the media.

For this project, we start from the understanding that the news media can influence political knowledge and we further advance this understanding, by using a cross-national approach, to understand under which conditions the news media matter.

For decades, researchers viewed the media as having a minimal effect on opinion and behaviour. More recent work has revised those conclusions but the empirical record is mixed with some studies reporting positive effects for the mass media while others report null or even negative effects.

Our project

Through developing and comparing new techniques for assessing media effects using existing large cross-national surveys linked to media content, we aim to more clearly specify the role of the media on opinion and behavior and under what conditions the media matter.

This project also demonstrates the potential for secondary data analysis to address major debates within and across political communication and media studies.c:["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":[["$","$L14",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$15"}}],["$","$L16",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"The information environment and participation","description":"$17","url":["https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=851687","https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/851687"],"keywords":["MEDIA","ELECTIONS","TURNOUT"],"identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-851687"],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UK Data Service","url":"https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=851687"}],"sponsor":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Economic and Social Research Council"}],"temporalCoverage":"1999-05-01/2009-06-15"},"extra_data":{"language_codes":["en"],"data_access":null,"genetic_data_collected":false,"harmony_id":"ukds/851687","start_year":1999,"sex":"all","source":["ukds"],"slug":"information-environment-and-participation","dois":["http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-851687"],"country_codes":["AT","BE","BG","CY","CZ","DE","DK","EE","ES","FI","FR","GB","GR","HU","IE","IT","LT","LU","LV","MT","NL","PL","PT","RO","SE","SI","SK"],"resource_type":"dataset","end_year":2009,"study_design":[],"instruments":[],"ai_summary":null,"name":"The information environment and participation","geographic_coverage":" Belgium Bulgaria Czech Republic Denmark Germany Estonia Ireland Greece Spain France Italy Cyprus Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Hungary Malta Netherlands Austria Poland Portugal Romania Slovenia Slovakia Finland Sweden United Kingdom","duration_years":10,"num_variables":null,"urls":["https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=851687","https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/851687"],"uuid":"654d725946e1dcd8753251ae75d8b5e3"},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]}}]]}]

Contemporary developments in media and political structures, such as the expansion of commercial broadcasting and weakening of political partisanship, further elevate the role of the media.

For this project, we start from the understanding that the news media can influence political knowledge and we further advance this understanding, by using a cross-national approach, to understand under which conditions the news media matter.

For decades, researchers viewed the media as having a minimal effect on opinion and behaviour. More recent work has revised those conclusions but the empirical record is mixed with some studies reporting positive effects for the mass media while others report null or even negative effects.

Our project

Through developing and comparing new techniques for assessing media effects using existing large cross-national surveys linked to media content, we aim to more clearly specify the role of the media on opinion and behavior and under what conditions the media matter.

This project also demonstrates the potential for secondary data analysis to address major debates within and across political communication and media studies.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"The information environment and participation"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"The information environment and participation"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/information-environment-and-participation"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"The information environment and participation"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The information environment and participation"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
