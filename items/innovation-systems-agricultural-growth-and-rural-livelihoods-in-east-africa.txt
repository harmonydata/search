18:T93a,These primary data are taken from a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods employed over two years in three countries in East Africa: Kenya, Sudan and Uganda. In each of the three countries research teams worked in four sites which were split across two districts (Uganda), counties (Kenya) or states (Sudan). 
The methodology progressed from inductive qualitative tools from which hypotheses were developed to deductive qualitative and quantitative investigation.  Inductive methods included key informant interviews (not included in these data due to issues with confidentiality), agricultural timelines, innovation histories and communication maps – a mixture of textual and visual data.

From interviews with key informants and a document review the research team will build up a detailed picture of organisations and institutions that support and provide services to smallholder farmers in Kenya, Sudan and Uganda. They will then carry out a detailed investigation of recent innovation activity in four sites in each country and of the factors that have constrained and those that have supported innovation.

Participatory research tools will include innovation histories, communication maps, value chain analysis and timelines. The analysis will generate hypotheses linking institutional arrangements, innovation activity, and changes in farm output, livelihoods, and incomes.
