This dataset of names and addresses for individual census records is organised per country (England and Wales; Scotland) and per census year. Within each data file each census record contains first and last name, street address and an individual identification code (RecID) that allows linking with the corresponding anonymised I-CeM record. The data cannot be used for true linking of individual census records across census years for commercial genealogy purposes nor for any other commercial purposes. The SL arrangements are required to ensure that commercial sensitivity is protected. For information on making an application, see the Access section.
The data were updated in February 2020, with some files redeposited with longer field length limits. Users should note that some name and address fields are truncated due to the limits set by the LDS project that transcribed the original data. No more than 10,000 records out of some 210 million across the study should be affected. Examples include:
England and Wales:
1851 - truncated at the 24th character (maximum I-CeM field length 95 characters)1881 - truncated at the 16th character (maximum I-CeM field length 50 characters).
Scotland: for 1851‐71, truncations affect less than 0.01% of all addresses and for 1851 around 1% at most
1851 - truncated at the 70th character1861 - truncated at the 76th character1871 - truncated at the 82th character1881 - truncated at the 50th character.
