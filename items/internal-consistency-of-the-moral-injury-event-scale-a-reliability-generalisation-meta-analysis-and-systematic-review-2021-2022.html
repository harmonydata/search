While it reported satisfactory psychometric properties in its early development studies, it has since been used in multiple contexts and populations without assessment of its changing reliability or validity. A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the MIES psychometric properties across settings and to determine the factors influencing its variability. A systematic search of electronic databases (PsychINFO; PTSD Pubs; MEDLINE; Scopus; Web of Science) was undertaken to identify studies reporting MIES reliability and validity data. A total of 42 records were found up-to-April-2022. Most papers reported Cronbach&#x27;s Alpha so analyses of other reliability and validity metrics (e.g., test-retest, inter-rater reliability) were not possible. The review found the MIES to be a generally internally consistent tool based on alpha estimates at both Full-scale (α=.88) and Sub-scales (⍺=.82-.92). The review uncovered high heterogeneity and inconsistencies in its administration and modification although figures generally remained above acceptable levels (⍺≥.70). Based on the review, the MIES represents an internally reliably tool for measuring potentially morally injurious events and distress at both Full and Sub-Scales according to pooled Cronbach&#x27;s Alpha estimates.
