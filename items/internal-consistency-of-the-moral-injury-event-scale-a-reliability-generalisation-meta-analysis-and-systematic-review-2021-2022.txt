The review found the MIES to be a generally internally consistent tool based on alpha estimates at both Full-scale (α=.88) and Sub-scales (⍺=.82-.92). The review uncovered high heterogeneity and inconsistencies in its administration and modification although figures generally remained above acceptable levels (⍺≥.70). Based on the review, the MIES represents an internally reliably tool for measuring potentially morally injurious events and distress at both Full and Sub-Scales according to pooled Cronbach's Alpha estimates.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"The Internal Consistency of the Moral Injury Event Scale: A Reliability Generalisation Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"The Internal Consistency of the Moral Injury Event Scale: A Reliability Generalisation Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/internal-consistency-of-the-moral-injury-event-scale-a-reliability-generalisation-meta-analysis-and-systematic-review-2021-2022"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"The Internal Consistency of the Moral Injury Event Scale: A Reliability Generalisation Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The Internal Consistency of the Moral Injury Event Scale: A Reliability Generalisation Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
