An exploratory all-languages analysis yielded both main effects, and a predicted interaction, such that the effect of PND was greater for forms with lower surface-form frequency, which are less available for direct retrieval from memory. Cross-linguistic differences were investigated with exploratory analyses of case variance, affix syncretism and stem changes.

It will use multiple methods to address central issues, create new technology products, and communicate evidence-based information directly to other researchers and to parents, practitioners and policy-makers. 
LuCiD's RESEARCH AGENDA will address four key questions in language and communicative development: 1) ENVIRONMENT: How do children combine the different kinds of information that they see and hear to learn language? 2) KNOWLEDGE: How do children learn the word meanings and grammatical categories of their language? 3) COMMUNICATION: How do children learn to use their language to communicate effectively? 4) VARIATION: How do children learn languages with different structures and in different cultural environments?
The fifth stream, the LANGUAGE 0-5 PROJECT, will connect the other four streams. It will follow 80 English learning children from 6 months to 5 years, studying how and why some children's language development is different from others. A key feature of this project is that the children will take part in studies within the other four streams. This will enable us to build a complete picture of language development from the very beginning through to school readiness.
Applying different methods to study children's language development will constrain the types of explanations that can be proposed, helping us create much more accurate theories of language development. We will observe and record children in natural interaction as well as studying their language in more controlled experiments, using behavioural measures and correlations with brain activity (EEG). Transcripts of children's language and interaction will be analysed and used to model how these two are related using powerful computer algorithms.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"International Centre for Language and Communicative Development: Language-general and Language-specific Phenomena in the Acquisition of Inflectional Noun Morphology: A Cross-linguistic Elicited-production Study of Polish, Finnish and Estonian, 2014-2020"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"International Centre for Language and Communicative Development: Language-general and Language-specific Phenomena in the Acquisition of Inflectional Noun Morphology: A Cross-linguistic Elicited-production Study of Polish, Finnish and Estonian, 2014-2020"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/international-centre-for-language-and-communicative-development-language-general-and-language-specific-phenomena-in-the-acquisition-of-inflectional"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"International Centre for Language and Communicative Development: Language-general and Language-specific Phenomena in the Acquisition of Inflectional Noun Morphology: A Cross-linguistic Elicited-production Study of Polish, Finnish and Estonian, 2014-2020"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"International Centre for Language and Communicative Development: Language-general and Language-specific Phenomena in the Acquisition of Inflectional Noun Morphology: A Cross-linguistic Elicited-production Study of Polish, Finnish and Estonian, 2014-2020"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
