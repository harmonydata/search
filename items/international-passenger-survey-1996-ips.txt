 There are three versions of the IPS data, the travelpac version the simplest both in format and ease of use, the reduced version used for fuller queries but restricted in the number of variables and the main data for expert users which contain all analysable variables.
Travelpac dataset - for simple data queries, users may prefer to use these data as they are extremely simple and can be joined together to form a time series.  The results should be consistent with those published by ONS in Travel Trends.
Reduced dataset - the depositor recommends using this dataset for fuller queries as it contains most of the important analysable information and will due to their nature be much easier to understand and tabulate. Although the variable list is the same from year to year, care must be taken with these files when trying to perform time series operations as codes can also vary from year to year for some variables.
Main dataset - The depositor recommends that only expert users who are very familiar with the coding and weighting structures use this dataset as limited support is available.  Some considerable understanding of the data is required before meaningful analyses can be made, care must be taken when performing time series operations  as codes can vary from year to year and not all variables from one  years dataset are used in other years.  The data comprises four files, ALCOHOL, AIRMILES, QREGTOWN and QCONTACT with four quarters  per file for QREGTOWN and QCONTACT.  ALCOHOL and AIRMILES cover all four quarters  in one file.  These can be joined together using the  variables YEAR,  SERIAL, FLOW  and QUARTER.  The weighting of IPS data is  complex and  done in several  stages.  When working with the system  weights, great  care should be  taken to read the documentation  concerning weighting procedures as  not all records are treated in  exactly the same way (this does not  apply to the smaller datasets).  The travelpac dataset for 1996 contains the following 14 variables:
Year; quarter; ukos; mode of travel; purpose of visit; package tour; country of visit/residence; age group; gender; length of stay; visits; expenditure; number of nights spent on trip; sample.

The reduced dataset for 1996 contains the following 23 variables:
Year; quarter; month; flow; purpose of visit; package tour; country of visit/residence; states within countries for overseas residents; nationality of contact; age group; gender; people; United Kingdom airport,  sea route or tunnel mode; direct leg overseas port; final overseas port;  ossport; mode of travel used; number in vehicle; type of flight;  class of travel; number of nights spent on trip; expenditure; weight of  contact.

The main dataset for 1996 contains 127 variables and covers:
AIRMILES - quarter; flow; serial; United Kingdom port or route; direct leg overseas port; final overseas port; distance from United Kingdom port to first port; from first to second port; from United Kingdom port to second port.

QREGTOWN - year; quarter; month; flow; serial; towns stayed in overnight; number of nights spent in towns; expenditure in towns; regional stay weight; regional visit weight; regional expenditure weight; various validation checks.
