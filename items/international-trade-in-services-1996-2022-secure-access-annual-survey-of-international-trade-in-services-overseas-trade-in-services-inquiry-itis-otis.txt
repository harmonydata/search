The ITIS inquiry (formally called the Overseas Trade in Services Inquiry) was forged as a result of the merging of the Annual and Quarterly Inquiries into Royalties and Services (RASI) and the Annual and Quarterly Inquiries of Overseas Trade of Consultants (CONS) in 1996. The ITIS survey collects data on UK resident companies’ international transactions in services, and includes the type and value of service imports/exports and the country of origin/destination of the services. (Note: companies are not required to identify the country for transactions less than £10,000.)The ITIS survey is also supplemented by information collected via the Annual Business Survey (ABS) (UK Data Archive SN 7451) in relation to amounts paid or received for the imports or exports of services.ITIS covers the whole economy, with the exception of: finance, travel and transport, higher education, charities, and most activities in the legal profession, which are collected from other sources. For the 2021 collection onwards, the ITIS sample has been expanded to include new industries, notably in the financial sector and higher education. For the 2022 collection onwards, the ITIS sample has also been expanded to cover transport and travel industries.The results contribute to the key components of the measurement of the UK’s Balance of Payments and of Gross Domestic Product.

2d:Taec,The UK's International Trade in Services (ITIS) data are collected from a number of different survey and administrative sources. The ITIS inquiry (formally called the Overseas Trade in Services Inquiry) was forged as a result of the merging of the Annual and Quarterly Inquiries into Royalties and Services (RASI) and the Annual and Quarterly Inquiries of Overseas Trade of Consultants (CONS) in 1996. The ITIS survey collects data on UK resident companies’ international transactions in services, and includes the type and value of service imports/exports and the country of origin/destination of the services. (Note: companies are not required to identify the country for transactions less than £10,000.)The ITIS survey is also supplemented by information collected via the Annual Business Survey (ABS) (UK Data Archive SN 7451) in relation to amounts paid or received for the imports or exports of services.ITIS covers the whole economy, with the exception of: finance, travel and transport, higher education, charities, and most activities in the legal profession, which are collected from other sources. For the 2021 collection onwards, the ITIS sample has been expanded to include new industries, notably in the financial sector and higher education. For the 2022 collection onwards, the ITIS sample has also been expanded to cover transport and travel industries.The results contribute to the key components of the measurement of the UK’s Balance of Payments and of Gross Domestic Product. In addition, the results are used in the industrial and non-industrial services breakdown within the current price Input-Output Supply and Use Tables. For further information, the latest ITIS UK Statistical Bulletins are available from the Office for National Statistics web site.Linking to other business studiesThese data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register reference numbers.  These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations.  Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together.  Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research.Latest edition informationFor the thirteenth edition (May 2025), the two separate 2021 imports and exports data files have been replaced by a single combined imports-exports 2021 data file. A combined 2022 data file has also been added to the study. In addition, the documentation has been updated.
