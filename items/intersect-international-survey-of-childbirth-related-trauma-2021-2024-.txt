2b:Taeb,The International Survey of Childbirth-Related Trauma, 2021-2024 (INTERSECT) study aims to examine birth-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) internationally. Being pregnant and having a baby is a time of huge physiological, psychological and social change. Although the birth of a baby is generally viewed positively, research suggests that between 20% and 40% of women find childbirth psychologically traumatic. Some of these women go on to develop PTSD as a result. Variation in the prevalence of birth-related PTSD and experiences of birth trauma and the expression of PTSD between countries has yet to be determined. The specific aims of the study were to undertake the following actions across countries: Estimate the prevalence of birth trauma and PTSD; Examine differences in symptom presentation; and Determine risk factors associated with childbirth-related PTSD symptoms.
Methods: INTERSECT is an international cross-sectional survey of birth trauma and birth-related PTSD, including related outcomes of birth satisfaction and depression, and risk factors. Women were recruited when attending routine maternity or family services. Participants completed the survey 6-12 weeks after birth, online, on paper, or by telephone interview. The data from all participating countries were combined to form the international dataset on childbirth-related trauma. The data were largely collected at local levels and should not be considered representative of any national population. It is anticipated that the next round of the survey will be conducted by the end of 2025 and will include additional countries.
Dataset: The INTERSECT dataset includes 11,302 participants from 31 countries: Australia, Brazil, Chile, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Malawi, Nepal, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and United Kingdom. Survey variables include the City Birth Trauma Scale, Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised, and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, as well as sociodemographic characteristics and variables related to the pregnancy, birth, infant, maternal mental health and previous trauma. The data can be used to examine relationships between any of these variables in all or a subset of countries.Latest edition informationFor the second edition (January 2025), the data and documentation were updated. Data on education for Saudi Arabia have been added, and the variables ptsd_dissoc and ptsd_delayed have been corrected; previously they excluded participants who might have a differential diagnosis of PTSD.
