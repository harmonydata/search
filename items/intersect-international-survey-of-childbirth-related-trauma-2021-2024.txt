Women were recruited when attending routine maternity or family services. Participants completed the survey 6-12 weeks after birth, online, on paper, or by telephone interview. The data from all participating countries were combined to form the international dataset on childbirth-related trauma. The data were largely collected at local levels and should not be considered representative of any national population. It is anticipated that the next round of the survey will be conducted by the end of 2025 and will include additional countries.
Dataset: The INTERSECT dataset includes 11,302 participants from 31 countries: Australia, Brazil, Chile, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Malawi, Nepal, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and United Kingdom. Survey variables include the City Birth Trauma Scale, Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised, and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, as well as sociodemographic characteristics and variables related to the pregnancy, birth, infant, maternal mental health and previous trauma. The data can be used to examine relationships between any of these variables in all or a subset of countries.Latest edition informationFor the second edition (January 2025), the data and documentation were updated. Data on education for Saudi Arabia have been added, and the variables ptsd_dissoc and ptsd_delayed have been corrected; previously they excluded participants who might have a differential diagnosis of PTSD.
