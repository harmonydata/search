It has also resulted in a significant focus on engaged research projects and the non-academic outputs include a graphic novel about abortion in Mexico City, podcasts about abortion in Peru, and a global abortion database about abortion access. 

The primary findings of the research are:
- the argument that states in Latin America are 'states of uncare' in relation to abortion
- that abortion care activists provide spaces of care where that is denied by the state
- the development of 'strategic ignorance' in abortion scholarship to better understand how abortion clandestinity is maintained
- the development of a 'chemical geography' of the abortion pill misoprostol 
- a conceptual development of a 'geography of abortion'This research project concerns the spatiality of reproductive health in Latin America. I am interested in the spatial dynamics of abortion access and the ways in which abortion prohibition has been resisted using different technologies. My interest in mobility and the regulation of mobility takes into account both bodies that move and medication and medical technologies that are transported. 

The project involves fieldwork in Mexico, Peru, and Argentina and is a qualitative project that mainly focuses on interviews with abortion activists and experts. It also has a significant focus on engaged research projects and non-academic outputs include a graphic novel about abortion in Mexico City, podcasts about abortion in Peru, and a global abortion database about abortion access. 

This research project has the following aims:
1) To explore how governmental regimes and non-legislative barriers prohibit safe, legal abortions in Latin America.
2) To understand how pregnant women and activists devise strategies, form networks, and resist these barriers to seek
reproductive healthcare through travel and the transportation of abortion medication.
3) To highlight women's experiences of being forced to undertake travel in search of abortions and use their testimonies for
