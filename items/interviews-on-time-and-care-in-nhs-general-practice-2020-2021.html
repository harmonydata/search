Its original aim was to study the relationship between care and time during long periods of ‘watchful waiting’ in general practice. The emphasis on achieving clinical outcomes by adhering to tightly controlled timeframes when providing access, advice and treatments was at odds with the temporalities of much of the healthcare falling within its remit (intractable, complicated, long term and medically unexplained health conditions often with no clear ‘outcomes’). Responding to the discrepancy, this research investigated what forms of care could issue from time in general practice in situations in which nothing appeared to improve or get better. Based on interviews with healthcare workers in clinical and non-clinical roles, observations of routine GP appointments, observations of Balint group meetings and personal testimonies of general practitioners made publicly available online, it explored this understudied area of everyday healthcare through a series of ethnographically derived cases. The study formed part of ‘Waiting Times’, a wider interdisciplinary research project funded by the Wellcome Trust [205400]. This wider project – which ran from 2017 to 2023 and included the work of artists, psychoanalysts, historians and literary scholars – was a collaboration between Exeter University and Birkbeck, University of London, to investigate the temporalities of waiting in healthcare by taking a multi-stranded approach to understanding its significance as a cultural and psychosocial concept, and as an embodied and historical experience. Through this research, we sought to produce a critical theory of temporal endurance that could help to explain why experiences of suspension and waiting are so difficult to tolerate in the present time, and what are the potentialities of waiting as a form of care [https://waitingtimes.exeter.ac.uk/].\",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/interviews-on-time-and-care-in-nhs-general-practice-2020-2021\",\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-857332\"],\"keywords\":[\"ARRANGEMENT OF WORKING TIME\",\"MEDICAL CARE\",\"COVID-19\",\"GENERAL PRACTITIONERS\",\"CHRONIC ILLNESS\"],\"temporalCoverage\":\"2020-07-09/2021-04-30\"}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"c:[\"$\",\"$5\",null,{\"fallback\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":\"Loading...\"}],\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$L16\",null,{\"strategy\":\"beforeInteractive\",\"id\":\"structured-data\",\"type\":\"application/ld+json\",\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"$17\"}}],\"$L18\"]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"19:I[78977,[\"9692\",\"static/js/9692.83f9877c.js\",\"1759\",\"static/js/1759.b13f3ee1.js\",\"690\",\"static/js/690.e023e61b.js\",\"3535\",\"static/js/3535.878ceef2.js\",\"5332\",\"static/js/5332.4ca3e6c6.js\",\"2410\",\"static/js/2410.ec36c5aa.js\",\"5183\",\"static/js/5183.9f1a7545.js\",\"5738\",\"static/js/5738.d28a9943.js\",\"3055\",\"static/js/3055.87b66c06.js\",\"8977\",\"static/js/8977.25169e64.js\",\"6387\",\"static/js/app/items/%5Bslug%5D/page.0819d17d.js\"],\"default\"]\n1a:Tb1b,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"These data were collected as part of a four-year Wellcome Trust funded research project tracking the relation between waiting and care in general practice in a moment of overlapping crises for the NHS.
