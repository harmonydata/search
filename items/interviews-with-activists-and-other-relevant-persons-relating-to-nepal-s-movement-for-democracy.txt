2e:Tbfe,This data collection describes the experiences of being a human rights volunteer in Nepal during the period 2004-6, when repression by the state was severe; and to the establishment and involvement in a citizens’ movement against autocracy between 2005-2008. In-depth interviews with human rights activists, NGO personnel and other citizen's movements activists, contribute to an understanding of how violence and civil conflict impinge on and transform the organisation and meaning of non-governmental action, from a perspective grounded in the everyday world of NGO workers. 

The research contributes to building theory around non-governmental public action by enhancing current understanding of how the organisation and meaning of non-governmental public action is transformed under civil conflict; and generate new and detailed empirical knowledge on the day to day activities of non-governmental organisations under conflict.

The research explored how violence and civil conflict impinge on and transform the organisation and meaning of non-governmental action, from a perspective grounded in the everyday world of NGO workers. Focusing on development NGOs in Nepal at a time of considerable political turmoil, it described and analysed the impact of violence and conflict on the experience of NGO workers, and on everyday practices in the NGO setting.

The research was guided by the following:
1. How have NGO workers at different levels experienced the conflict?
2. What strategies have organisational actors developed at individual and institutional level in response?
3. How have the experience of conflict and individual and institutional responses to it transformed the nature and meaning of NGO work and activity?
4. What have been the consequences for the ability of NGOs to carry out 'civil society' functions and to claim a space within Nepal's civil society?

It was based on intensive fieldwork in the headquarters and the field offices of two national NGOs, and informal and formal discussions with managers and staff of the organisations at all levels. These data werebe supplemented with documentary evidence of the implications of the conflict on NGOs (eg newspapers, NGO reports and publications) collected in situ.

The study:
1. built theory around non-governmental public action;
2. contributed by enhancing current understanding of how the organisation and meaning of non-governmental public action is transformed under civil conflict;
3. generated new and detailed empirical knowledge on the day to day activities of non-governmental organisations under conflict; 
 4. and strengthened the co-production of knowledge between researcher and researched, practitioner and academic communities, in particular, through exploring collaboratively methodological issues and approaches to doing research under conditions of civil conflict.

User groups include:
1. NGO sector in Nepal and internationally;
2. Academic audience in Nepal and internationally; 
3. Donors, bilateral agencies in Nepal/UK; agencies involved in NGO training and support.29:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2e"}]
