Interviews include discussions of reasons for moving to neighbourhood; previous neighbourhood histories; schooling strategies; attitudes to and involvement in neighbourhood; attitudes to social mix; political and social outlooks.

This forms part of a study investigates the contemporary characteristics of the &#x27;new urban&#x27; middle classes in France and Britain by comparing Paris and London in terms of the different types of neighbourhoods in which middle-class people have settled, particularly over the last 25 years: gentrified, gentrifying, gated communities, suburban and exurban neighbourhoods. 

The study investigates to what extent middle-class attitudes and activities vary across these locations and the impact of Paris and London as global cities on these activities. The study finds that neighbourhood location is a strong factor for distinguishing social identity and activities and social norms of different middle-class fractions. Strong gender distinctions persist across the different neighbourhoods that are further distinguished by generational differences in the fortunes and aspirations of the middle classes. The degrees of investment in and identification with neighbourhood varies - within and between London and Paris - as do the responses to social mix, sometimes in unexpected ways. All the neighbourhoods show specific types of what we call &#x27;selective neighbourhood advocacy&#x27; by middle-class residents. This neighbourhood-specific selective advocacy challenges the assumptions of nationally-based urban and neighbourhood policy that sees middle-class residents as advocates in socially-mixed neighbourhoods helping to improve services and political responsiveness to these neighbourhoods. 

The study of middle-class attitudes and activities within these neighbourhoods and the political and social implications of these affiliations and engagements are explored at neighbourhood, city, national and transnational scales.
This comparative study investigates the contemporary social and political characteristics and activities of the urban middle classes in Paris and London. It investigates a range of neighbourhood types in each city: inner city gentrified (not socially mixed); gentrifying (socially mixed); suburban; exurban and gated communities.

Aim was to ask to what extent the middle classes compare or contrast across these different locations in terms of their social relations and political attitudes and engagements, including, for example, schooling, use of public services and neighbourhood activism.

The research consists of depth interviews with middle class residents and elite actors in each neighbourhood as well as an analysis of relevant documents that discuss middle class identity and activity in these cities.

The study will to draw out the implications of the findings for urban politics and policies (compared with the role the middle classes are assumed to play in these policies) at the neighbourhood, city, national and transnational scales.

This is a fully comparative bilateral project with colleagues in Paris who are equivalently funded by the Agence de Nationale de la Recherche."/><meta property="og:title" content="Interviews with middle class residents in the city: a comparison of Paris and London"/><meta property="og:description" content="Transcripts of 154 in-depth interviews with middle class residents of inner urban gentrifying (Peckham), inner urban gentrified (Balham), suburban (Berrylands) and exurban (West Horsely and Effingham) neighbourhoods in London.

with middle class residents in the city: a comparison of Paris and London\",\"description\":\"Transcripts of 154 in-depth interviews with middle class residents of inner urban gentrifying (Peckham), inner urban gentrified (Balham), suburban (Berrylands) and exurban (West Horsely and Effingham) neighbourhoods in London. Interviews include discussions of reasons for moving to neighbourhood; previous neighbourhood histories; schooling strategies; attitudes to and involvement in neighbourhood; attitudes to social mix; political and social outlooks.\\n\\nThis forms part of a study investigates the contemporary characteristics of the 'new urban' middle classes in France and Britain by comparing Paris and London in terms of the different types of neighbourhoods in which middle-class people have settled, particularly over the last 25 years: gentrified, gentrifying, gated communities, suburban and exurban neighbourhoods. \\n\\nThe study investigates to what extent middle-class attitudes and activities vary across these locations and the impact of Paris and London as global cities on these activities. The study finds that neighbourhood location is a strong factor for distinguishing social identity and activities and social norms of different middle-class fractions. Strong gender distinctions persist across the different neighbourhoods that are further distinguished by generational differences in the fortunes and aspirations of the middle classes. The degrees of investment in and identification with neighbourhood varies - within and between London and Paris - as do the responses to social mix, sometimes in unexpected ways. All the neighbourhoods show specific types of what we call 'selective neighbourhood advocacy' by middle-class residents. This neighbourhood-specific selective advocacy challenges the assumptions of nationally-based urban and neighbourhood policy that sees middle-class residents as advocates in socially-mixed neighbourhoods helping to improve services and political responsiveness to these neighbourhoods. \\n\\nThe study of middle-class attitudes and activities within these neighbourhoods and the political and social implications of these affiliations and engagements are explored at neighbourhood, city, national and transnational scales.\\nThis comparative study investigates the contemporary social and political characteristics and activities of the urban middle classes in Paris and London.
