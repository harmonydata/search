In phase one, 50 biographical interviews were conducted with LGBT migrants from Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union living in Scotland. The interviews were semi-structured and covered themes such as: socio-economic background and place of origin; life as an LGBT person in the country of origin; motivations to migrate; experiences of migration and settlement; plans for the future. At the end of the interview, participants were asked to draw a sociogram (a diagram representing their most meaningful social relations); this was discussed in the last part of the interview; 49 sociograms were collected (one participant did not complete the sociogram).
A selection of stage one participants were asked to take part in the second phase of the study. 
In phase two we collected 18 photo diaries; the task involved collating personal pictures (portraying objects, landscapes and people) representing  their ideas of ‘home’ into a template provided by the researchers. Participants were free to submit pictures taken especially for the photo diary and/or old pictures. The format is either digital pictures taken on participants&#x27; devices or Polaroid pictures (camera provided by research team). It also involved conducting 18 follow-up interviews with participants who completed the photo diary, expanding on the meaning of and stories behind the pictures, and on some matters arising from interviews in stage one.
Despite a growing body of empirical research focusing on migration and same-sex sexualities, this work has thus far mainly focussed on North America. To date, little empirical research has been conducted on intra-European queer migration, despite very uneven levels of recognition of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) rights across Europe. This raises questions as to whether transnational migration can be a strategy for enabling non-heteronormative practices and identities, and for accessing sexual citizenship rights.
The project explores how sexuality may shape intra-European migration through a focus on the lived experiences of LGBT migrants who have moved to Scotland from the postsocialist region [Eastern Europe (EE) and the Former Soviet Union (FSU)]. The project&#x27;s geographical scope is timely, as comparative surveys point to an East/West divide within Europe in terms of policy, legislation and attitudes towards LGBT citizens, with the UK ranked among the most progressive European countries and most countries from the post-socialist region lagging behind (FRA 2013). Moreover, since the mid-2000s the UK has experienced high rates of immigration from the region, with an estimated 653,000 Eastern Europeans settling in the UK in the period 2004-2011 (Vargas-Silva 2013:4). 
A focus on Scotland as a migration destination can illuminate broader issues related to UK and intra-European queer migration, whilst also presenting a distinctive case, owing to: i) the significant recent influx of migrants from the post-socialist region to Scotland ii) the higher proportion of European to non-European migrants in Scotland compared to most other UK regions; iii) Scotland&#x27;s recent shift from a country of emigration to a country with a positive migration balance; iv) Scotland&#x27;s devolved government and specific demographic and socio-legal context within the UK, despite migration remaining a &#x27;reserved&#x27; Westminster matter.
This project provides an in-depth and nuanced exploration of the lived experiences of LGBT migrants, generating significant original data and fresh insights into the role of sexuality in the migration process. The project is interdisciplinary in nature, and draws on empirical, theoretical and methodological insights from sociology, area studies, human geography and anthropology. The research innovatively brings together theoretical frameworks previously used in isolation (intersectionality, transnationalism and personal communities). It combines biographical interviews (phase 1) with visual methods (photo diaries, sociograms) and follow-up interviews (phase 2), in order to capture the complexity of migrants&#x27; experiences, multiple belongings and emotional attachments. The research explores how sexuality and gender identity affect reasons for migrating, experiences of migration and plans for long-term settlement. It also contextualises migrants&#x27; sense of (dis)comfort, (in)security and belonging within the social networks they cultivate across home and host societies, and considers the role played by sexuality and ethnicity in shaping migrants&#x27; &#x27;personal communities&#x27; (Pahl and Spencer 2004) and their engagements with them."/><meta property="og:title" content="Intimate migrations: LGBT migrants from Central Eastern Europe and Former Soviet Union in Scotland 2015-2016"/><meta property="og:description" content="The project generated a set of qualitative data.

In phase one, 50 biographical interviews were conducted with LGBT migrants from Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union living in Scotland. The interviews were semi-structured and covered themes such as: socio-economic background and place of origin; life as an LGBT person in the country of origin; motivations to migrate; experiences of migration and settlement; plans for the future. At the end of the interview, participants were asked to draw a sociogram (a diagram representing their most meaningful social relations); this was discussed in the last part of the interview; 49 sociograms were collected (one participant did not complete the sociogram).\\nA selection of stage one participants were asked to take part in the second phase of the study. \\nIn phase two we collected 18 photo diaries; the task involved collating personal pictures (portraying objects, landscapes and people) representing  their ideas of ‘home’ into a template provided by the researchers. Participants were free to submit pictures taken especially for the photo diary and/or old pictures. The format is either digital pictures taken on participants' devices or Polaroid pictures (camera provided by research team). It also involved conducting 18 follow-up interviews with participants who completed the photo diary, expanding on the meaning of and stories behind the pictures, and on some matters arising from interviews in stage one.\\nDespite a growing body of empirical research focusing on migration and same-sex sexualities, this work has thus far mainly focussed on North America. To date, little empirical research has been conducted on intra-European queer migration, despite very uneven levels of recognition of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) rights across Europe. This raises questions as to whether transnational migration can be a strategy for enabling non-heteronormative practices and identities, and for accessing sexual citizenship rights.\\nThe project explores how sexuality may shape intra-European migration through a focus on the lived experiences of LGBT migrants who have moved to Scotland from the postsocialist region [Eastern Europe (EE) and the Former Soviet Union (FSU)]. The project's geographical scope is timely, as comparative surveys point to an East/West divide within Europe in terms of policy, legislation and attitudes towards LGBT citizens, with the UK ranked among the most progressive European countries and most countries from the post-socialist region lagging behind (FRA 2013). Moreover, since the mid-2000s the UK has experienced high rates of immigration from the region, with an estimated 653,000 Eastern Europeans settling in the UK in the period 2004-2011 (Vargas-Silva 2013:4). \\nA focus on Scotland as a migration destination can illuminate broader issues related to UK and intra-European queer migration, whilst also presenting a distinctive case, owing to: i) the significant recent influx of migrants from the post-socialist region to Scotland ii) the higher proportion of European to non-European migrants in Scotland compared to most other UK regions; iii) Scotland's recent shift from a country of emigration to a country with a positive migration balance; iv) Scotland's devolved government and specific demographic and socio-legal context within the UK, despite migration remaining a 'reserved' Westminster matter.\\nThis project provides an in-depth and nuanced exploration of the lived experiences of LGBT migrants, generating significant original data and fresh insights into the role of sexuality in the migration process. The project is interdisciplinary in nature, and draws on empirical, theoretical and methodological insights from sociology, area studies, human geography and anthropology. The research innovatively brings together theoretical frameworks previously used in isolation (intersectionality, transnationalism and personal communities).
