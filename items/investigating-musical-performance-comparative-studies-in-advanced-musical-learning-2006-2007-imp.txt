 The quantitative survey covered the following areas:musical biographies (age, sex, musical genre, instrumental type, experience, experience of teaching)psychological and social-psychological issues related to performance experiences (performance anxiety, self-esteem, self-efficacy, musical identity, and the development of expertise) attitudes to, and experience of, learning (practice behaviours, views on teaching, social and environmental learning contexts (such as on the process of transition from undergraduate to professional career)) The semi-structured interviews focused on a range of issues related to each musician’s personal development and experiences. Questions were clustered under overarching themes that embraced early influences on their musical development, self-efficacy and confidence as performers, reflections on performance experiences, the occurrence and possible influence of performance anxiety, the influence of the institution on learning, their thoughts on the process of transition from student to professional, any experiences of teaching and, finally, their experiences and views regarding formal and informal learning in music.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Investigating Musical Performance: Comparative Studies in Advanced Musical Learning, 2006-2007 / IMP"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Investigating Musical Performance: Comparative Studies in Advanced Musical Learning, 2006-2007 / IMP"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/investigating-musical-performance-comparative-studies-in-advanced-musical-learning-2006-2007-imp"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Investigating Musical Performance: Comparative Studies in Advanced Musical Learning, 2006-2007 / IMP"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Investigating Musical Performance: Comparative Studies in Advanced Musical Learning, 2006-2007 / IMP"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
