The pathophysiology of frailty is poorly understood but the immune and endocrine systems appear to be involved in its development or response. Age and frailty have been proven to be independently predictive of outcomes in patients admitted with an acute illness. 

In COVID-19, routine frailty identification has been used to inform decision making about high level of treatment. This is because frailty usually moderates the effect of age on mortality. Anecdotally, this effect has not been recognised by clinicians looking after older COVID-19 patients. Four papers have been published so far on the effect of frailty on COVID-19 with differing results.  However, all papers show the independent predictive value of age when controlling for frailty, which is not usually seen in studies of age and frailty in other acute illnesses.
