Due to the discontinuation of the MQ5 publication, there will be no opportunity to incorporate annual survey data for 2018. This quality assurance process is used to align quarterly survey data with annual survey data and can lead to significant revisions, but the 2018 estimates in this final MQ5 publication will not be subject to annual alignment. Similarly, there will be no further revisions to 2018 data following this publication, due to respondent revisions. Therefore, the 2018 estimates should be regarded with due caution. It is sometimes necessary to suppress figures for certain items to avoid disclosing investment activity by individual institutions. In these cases, the figures are usually combined with those for another item, and this will be indicated in the tables with a footnote. All estimates are reported on a current price basis (that is, they are not adjusted to remove the effects of inflation). 

A Glossary is available to assist your understanding of the terms used in this release.
