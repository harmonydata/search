Experiment 1 investigated whether repetition of the subject noun (e.g., arts, “doctor”) boosted structural priming and Experiment 2 investigated whether repetition of the verb (e.g., bracht, “brought”) did. Structural priming was stronger when the verb was repeated between the prime and target (Experiment 2), but not when the subject noun was (Experiment 1). We conclude that the recency of the repeated word relative to the primed structure does not affect the lexical boost and that the lexical boost only occurs with the repetition of the syntactic head of the primed argument structure.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Is the Lexical Boost Due to the Recency of the Repeated Word: Experimental Data, 2017-2022"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Is the Lexical Boost Due to the Recency of the Repeated Word: Experimental Data, 2017-2022"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/is-the-lexical-boost-due-to-the-recency-of-the-repeated-word-experimental-data-2017-2022"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Is the Lexical Boost Due to the Recency of the Repeated Word: Experimental Data, 2017-2022"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Is the Lexical Boost Due to the Recency of the Repeated Word: Experimental Data, 2017-2022"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
