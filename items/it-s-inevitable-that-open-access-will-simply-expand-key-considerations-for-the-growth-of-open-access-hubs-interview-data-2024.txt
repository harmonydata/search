They underscore the critical importance of embedding equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) principles within OA practices while advocating for robust funding models to ensure long-term sustainability. By addressing these challenges, OA hubs can evolve to support a more equitable and accessible academic publishing landscape. By prioritising sustainability and inclusivity, OA platforms can fulfil their potential to revolutionise scholarly communication, paving the way for a more equitable and accessible academic landscape.Open access hubs, including platforms like ArXiv, REPEC, SocArxiv, CrimRxiv, and institutional repositories, provide free and unrestricted access to preprint and postprint versions of academic publications. By offering an alternative to traditional peer reviewed journals, often owned by commercial publishers, through light-touch moderation these platforms accelerate the dissemination of academic work and enhance global accessibility.
However, open access hubs are not yet widely adopted in many fields, particularly in the Humanities and Social Sciences. This project investigates the legal, ethical, and technical challenges of establishing and maintaining online repositories for open access to academic literature.
Using semi-structured qualitative interviews with experts—such as open access hub founders, academic librarians, and leaders in the open science movement—the project explores:
- The legal challenges faced by open access platforms.
- Key ethical considerations involved in their operation.
- Technical barriers to wider usability and adoption.
The study identifies strategies to address these challenges and aims to inspire the development and growth of open access hubs within the social sciences. By drawing on lessons from existing platforms, the project contributes to a more inclusive, accessible, and efficient academic publishing landscape.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"It’s Inevitable That Open Access Will Simply Expand: Key Considerations for the Growth of Open Access Hubs: Interview Data, 2024"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"It’s Inevitable That Open Access Will Simply Expand: Key Considerations for the Growth of Open Access Hubs: Interview Data, 2024"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/it-s-inevitable-that-open-access-will-simply-expand-key-considerations-for-the-growth-of-open-access-hubs-interview-data-2024"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"It’s Inevitable That Open Access Will Simply Expand: Key Considerations for the Growth of Open Access Hubs: Interview Data, 2024"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"It’s Inevitable That Open Access Will Simply Expand: Key Considerations for the Growth of Open Access Hubs: Interview Data, 2024"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
