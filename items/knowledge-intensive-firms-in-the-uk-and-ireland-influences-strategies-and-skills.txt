Prior research in this area has been limited and, given the growth of employment in the sector in both economies, there are important questions about the workforce in this sector that the study will explore. The first stage will involve a comparison of relevant national-level data across the UK and Ireland, followed by eight in-depth, matched-pair case studies in firms in two key knowledge-intensive sectors in each country: pharmaceuticals and software development. The findings from these will be used to inform a survey of companies in both sectors employing 100 or more staff aimed at exploring management practices in knowledge-intensive firms.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Knowledge-Intensive Firms in the UK and Ireland: Influences, Strategies and Skills"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Knowledge-Intensive Firms in the UK and Ireland: Influences, Strategies and Skills"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/knowledge-intensive-firms-in-the-uk-and-ireland-influences-strategies-and-skills"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Knowledge-Intensive Firms in the UK and Ireland: Influences, Strategies and Skills"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Knowledge-Intensive Firms in the UK and Ireland: Influences, Strategies and Skills"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
