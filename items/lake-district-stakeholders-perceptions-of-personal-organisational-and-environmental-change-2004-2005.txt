This information would allow the members of the RELU CBP to gain a thorough understanding of their research and policy priorities, and be sensitive to their values and implicit assumptions in order to develop a smoother and more robust long term working relationship;

More specifically, to examine how expectations of change are embedded within perceptions of the (in)ability of organisations/regulatory frameworks/research tools to lead/adapt to environmental and socio-economic transformations.

The interviews cover the following issues:
1)	Personal and professional background and reasons for pursuing a career in the environment/conservation/development; 
2)	How interviewees’ perceptions of what they are doing are changing;
3)	How interviewees are trying to understand the present in the light of an emerging future;
