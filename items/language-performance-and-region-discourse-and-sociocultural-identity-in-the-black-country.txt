The project will record two live performances and transcribe these. Interviews with members of the audience at these performances will then be conducted. Analysing this data in the light of what is already known about the social values of linguistic features to the wider community will provide an inroad into looking at the values which these features have for performance artists, and the way in which they use these features in their shows.

The project will also mark the start of the creation of a web resource titled 'Midlands English: Speech and Society'.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Language, Performance, and Region: Discourse and Sociocultural Identity in the Black Country"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Language, Performance, and Region: Discourse and Sociocultural Identity in the Black Country"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/language-performance-and-region-discourse-and-sociocultural-identity-in-the-black-country"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Language, Performance, and Region: Discourse and Sociocultural Identity in the Black Country"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Language, Performance, and Region: Discourse and Sociocultural Identity in the Black Country"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
