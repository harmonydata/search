This is particularly relevant to the Black Country, where the associated speech variety is linked in media and UK wide perceptions to lower social status and lack of intelligence. Our data show that performers, using as they do a variety by definition refined and rehearsed and thus, one can argue, consciously deployed as a meaning-making resource, can choose aspects of their local speech variety depending on audience, purpose, location and other situational and social factors. The linguistic features they use to create meaning are not always those which a UK-wide view of Black Country dialect might suggest. Interviews with performers discussing their own views about language reveal sophisticated and complex metalinguistic beliefs about the intrinsic value of their own variety and its suitability as a vehicle for performance. The variants comedians discuss at interview are not necessarily those they draw on in creating humour. Thus while metalinguistic data can add to the sum of our knowledge about a speaker’s beliefs surrounding their variety, it is objective, and the semi-structured interview method may not be the only tool for gleaning attitudinal data from informants.
