By building on youth strategies the research illuminates our understanding of youth realities and rights, and how to support them to confront their feelings of marginalisation and find pathways out of poverty. \\nThe data set includes: an international summary report; thematic briefings on migration, street connection and disability; national briefings; site briefings for the eight sites; detailed site reports lead authored by national researchers; methodology and management guides; youth and participant profiles on excel that are coded but indicate aspects of youth and adult identity, migration and education experience and living situation; analysis data from C2 workshops of marginalised youth during the co-construction in Phase 2; a data base of around 300 C3 analysis sheets from in-depth case studies with marginalised youth conducted in Phase 3 (NVivo un-coded version); focused C4 analysis sheets and films from marginalised youth on thematic issues in Phase 4 (integrated into site reports); a selection of adult and stakeholder analysis sheets (integrated into the site reports); youth seminars and declarations and examples of launches and impact from Phase 5.Youth Uncertainty Rights (YOUR) World Research has carried out detailed large scale qualitative and participatory research with over 1000 of the most marginalised young people (aged 15-25 years), across eight fragile environments in Ethiopia and Nepal.
