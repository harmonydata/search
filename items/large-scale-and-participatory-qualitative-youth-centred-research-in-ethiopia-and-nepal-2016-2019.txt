YOUR World Research shows that when we include youth in the research process and listen to their views, a picture emerges of creativity and innovative ideas in the face of significant challenges and uncertainty in their lives and their environments.  The research, 2016-2019, has generated new knowledge about how marginalised youth perceive, navigate, negotiate and respond to uncertainty. By building on youth strategies the research illuminates our understanding of youth realities and rights, and how to support them to confront their feelings of marginalisation and find pathways out of poverty.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Large Scale and Participatory Qualitative Youth-Centred Research in Ethiopia and Nepal, 2016-2019"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$15"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Large Scale and Participatory Qualitative Youth-Centred Research in Ethiopia and Nepal, 2016-2019"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/large-scale-and-participatory-qualitative-youth-centred-research-in-ethiopia-and-nepal-2016-2019"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Large Scale and Participatory Qualitative Youth-Centred Research in Ethiopia and Nepal, 2016-2019"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Large Scale and Participatory Qualitative Youth-Centred Research in Ethiopia and Nepal, 2016-2019"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
