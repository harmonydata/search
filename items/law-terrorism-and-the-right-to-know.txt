The collection includes an explanatory note, the information and consent form, a list of transcripts by randomised code, and the collection of 65 interview transcripts. These cover 70 interviewees, as some interviews were done with two interviewees. This is almost the complete set of interviews.  One further interview was done but I was not given permission to record it and thus there is no transcript.  
With one exception, the transcripts are very heavily redacted. While unfortunate for anyone wishing to use them in future, this was unavoidable. The exception is transcript LTRK-063. 

Further detail is in the "data sourcing, processing and preparation" information. 

A complex, far-reaching, legal framework governs the way information about terrorism is obtained by the media and conveyed to the public. Counter-terrorism legislation is important, but so are defamation, contempt, official secrets, freedom of information, free speech rights, the protection of journalists' sources, and the legal and ethical rules surrounding how lawyers deal with the media. 

This research programme aims to examine, within that framework, how democratic traditions of media freedom which characterise and sustain our liberal democracy through open, informed public debate - the basis of the public's right to know - can best be balanced against the contemporary demands of national and international security.

The first of three linked projects looks at the media experience of reporting on terrorism. Using interviews with journalists and lawyers, the project will study the impact of the legal framework and consider also how agencies of the government manage and release information. The second project analyses legislative and judicial approaches to balancing openness and secrecy. The third project brings key stakeholders together at a conference to elicit and analyse their perspectives on how openness and secrecy should be balanced to achieve both liberty and security.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Law, terrorism and the right to know"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Law, terrorism and the right to know"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/law-terrorism-and-the-right-to-know"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Law, terrorism and the right to know"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Law, terrorism and the right to know"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
