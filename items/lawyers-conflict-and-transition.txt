to explore the contribution of lawyers in shaping local and international understandings of the ‘rule of law’

to interrogate the extent to which transitional contexts may be viewed as ‘exceptional’ from the experiences of settled democracies

to chart the relevance (or not) of key themes on the relationship between law, lawyers and political and social change in such contexts, in particular legal culture, colonial and post-colonial lawyering and legal pluralism.
