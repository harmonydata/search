A further study, &lt;i&gt;Life Before Death, 1987&lt;/i&gt; is held at the Data Archive as Study No. 2985.  Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
A) Questions asked of doctors
Whether anticipated deaths should be allowed in the home, ease of admission into suitable National Health Service institutions for different types of patient, types of beds needed most, adequacy of consultation between respondent and hospital staff over admission to and discharge from hospital.
Number of domiciliary consultations requested during last 12 months, number of nights on call per week for cases other than obstetrics, whether emergency services used/should be used for night calls. Helpfulness and adequacy of district nursing services for patients at home with terminal illnesses.
Suggestions for other services which could be helpful.
Whether relatives of patients in local area accept responsibility for care (reasons). Attitude to informing terminal patients of the nature of their illness, prescriptions or medical supervision given to bereaved. Direct access to hospital beds for terminally ill.
B) Questions asked of person who registered patient&#x27;s death.
Whether death expected, whether patient bedridden before death (duration), whether capabilities restricted, age at death, place of death, length of time in hospital, date of last visit to practitioner, whether employed during last 12 months, home help needed and received near time of death.
If respondent did not live in same house as deceased: distance away, cost of journey, frequency of visits to deceased in last 12 months, place of work, employment status, changes in work pattern/financial situation/other resulting from caring for deceased.
Help received from official services, opinion on whether deceased was better off at home/in hospital, changes in lifestyle since death.
C) Questions asked of domiciliary staff
Respondents were asked to indicate, from a list, services in the area which were available/they had used/they would like extended or introduced.
Amount of time respondent wanted to give to terminal cases, adequacy of contact with general practitioners/hospitals.
Symptoms suffered by deceased in last 12 months, details of type of help needed, equipment had/needed, expenditure incurred, knowledge of organisations providing equipment for invalids, whether deceased was unconscious/able to recognise relatives before death, whether respondent was present at death. Help needed/wanted after death, religion, visits from GP/health officials since death. Worries/anxieties since death, relative seen most since death (distance away).
Background Variables
A) Doctors
Type of practice, number of National Health Service patients, number of local authority or ancillary helpers available.
B) Person who registered patient&#x27;s death
Relation to deceased or length of friendship, marital status of deceased, household members at time of death/hospitalization (age, sex, relation to deceased). Age, sex and marital status of respondent.
