Two principal approaches were taken to creating the data from sources in groups 1-3. For the parish register material, data was entered into a relational database, whilst for the parish records and lists of inhabitants ‘semi-structured’ transcriptions were made. These latter comprise verbatim transcriptions with core information – usually relating to named individuals or payments made and received – organised in a tabular structure, sometimes with (clearly identified) added analytical apparatus. In all cases all material has followed the original orthography. These source-specific datasets were subsequently processed and reconfigured for various research strands as required. The current data collection contains the pre-processed transcripts, subjected to editing and cleaning10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Life in the Suburbs: Health, Domesticity and Status in Early Modern London, 1523-1720"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Life in the Suburbs: Health, Domesticity and Status in Early Modern London, 1523-1720"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/life-in-the-suburbs-health-domesticity-and-status-in-early-modern-london-1523-1720"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Life in the Suburbs: Health, Domesticity and Status in Early Modern London, 1523-1720"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Life in the Suburbs: Health, Domesticity and Status in Early Modern London, 1523-1720"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
