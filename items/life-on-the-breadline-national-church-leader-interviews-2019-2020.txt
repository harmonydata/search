The project arose from a recognition that as the state withdrew during the Age of Austerity begun after the 2010 UK General Election, the Church was increasingly stepping in to fill the gap, as seen, for example, in relation to the siting of 75% of UK food banks in local church buildings.

The aim of the project, which drew on theology and the social sciences, was to explore, describe and analyse the the nature, extent and impact of Christian responses to poverty in the UK since the 2008 global financial crash. We sought to develop resources and a variety of outputs that would enable Churches to become more effective and informed in their anti-poverty activism and help policymakers to develop a greater awareness of the role played by faith groups in responding to poverty.
