The aim was to better understand the long term impact of adoption on adopted people and adoptive parents, including the arrival of the next generation (children of adopted people). Parents and grandparents were interviewed using a  &#x27;life story&#x27; interview method (adapted from the work of Dan McAdams) where participants gave an account of their whole life, including adoption and becoming a  parent/grandparent. This method generated very rich data about how people viewed their whole life and the role of adoption in their life, with interviews lasting from 1-5 hours. The archive consists of the anonymised transcripts of in-depth interviews with the two groups of participants: (1) 38 people who were adopted as children and who have now become parents (20 mothers and 18 fathers, age range 21-54 years, mean = 33. Age at adoption varied from 0-12, with 60% being adopted over age 1 - median 1.5 years, mean 3.2 years). (2) 43 adoptive parents who are now grandparents through their adopted child/ren (23  grandmothers and 20 grandfathers, age range 47-75 years). This is almost the full dataset from the project - only 2 fathers withheld consent for their transcript to go in the archive. NB adopted adults are described as mothers or fathers; adoptive parents are described as grandmothers or grandfathers. Almost all participants were living in England and had adopted/been adopted in England. Small numbers were living in Scotland or Wales. Interviews took place in 2019-2020. Also archived is data about the demographics of the participants. About half the sample consisted of &#x27;linked&#x27; cases - where more than one member of a family had taken part, and information is given about which interviews are linked to each other.  Finally, study materials are archived (leaflets, information and debrief sheets, interview schedules, demographic data collection form, consent form).For 20 years UK policy has encouraged the adoption of children from care, and tens of thousands are now of an age where they could become a parent. This compulsory form of adoption is controversial at home and abroad and it is vital to fully research the lifespan effects - including what happens when adoptees become parents to the next generation. A child&#x27;s birth is a key event in any family, bringing joys and challenges. This study will provide a new understanding of the lived experiences and needs of people adopted from care who are now parents, and of adoptive parents who are now grandparents. It will inform support to help adopted young people to prepare for parenthood, promote their resilience, and support them as parents. 
The majority of children adopted from care will have experienced early adversities such as loss, abuse and neglect. Adoption offers permanence in a new family, but even so about half of adopted young people are likely to have psychological problems which carry on into adulthood. Studies of vulnerable parents (e.g. care leavers) show they are at risk of early parenthood, parenting difficulties, even their own children going into care. But for some, having a child is a positive choice and a healing experience. This study will explore the positives and the challenges of becoming a parent from the perspective of people adopted from care. The concept of &#x27;resilience&#x27; (healthy development after exposure to risk) is key and the risk and protective factors that can affect resilience in the context of parenting will be a central focus.
This study will also shine a light on the lifelong identity issues for adopted people. For adoptees, building identity can be hampered by gaps in their known life history, feelings of being different or stigmatised, and a lack of connection with birth relatives. Becoming a parent can stir up identity concerns and trigger a search for birth family, but these issues are unexplored for people adopted from care, many of whom will have retained some form of contact with birth relatives. We will explore how adopted people make meaning of their whole life history, including being adopted and being a parent, adding to our understanding of narrative identity development for adoptees in adulthood.
The research will also include the perspective of parents who adopted a child from care and who are now grandparents. Adoption has lifelong implications for adopters too, but there is no research on the grandparenting stage of family life in &#x27;from care&#x27; adoptions. Because of the ongoing vulnerability of many young people adopted from care, it is important to include grandparents because they may be providing vital support to their child and grandchild."/><meta property="og:title" content="Life Story Interviews with Adopted Adults Who Are Now Parents and Adoptive Parents Who Are Now Grandparents, 2018-2020"/><meta property="og:description" content="These data  were collected as part of an ESRC study exploring the experiences of adopted adults who were now parents, and adoptive parents who had become grandparents.

Story Interviews with Adopted Adults Who Are Now Parents and Adoptive Parents Who Are Now Grandparents, 2018-2020\",\"description\":\"These data  were collected as part of an ESRC study exploring the experiences of adopted adults who were now parents, and adoptive parents who had become grandparents. The aim was to better understand the long term impact of adoption on adopted people and adoptive parents, including the arrival of the next generation (children of adopted people). Parents and grandparents were interviewed using a  'life story' interview method (adapted from the work of Dan McAdams) where participants gave an account of their whole life, including adoption and becoming a  parent/grandparent. This method generated very rich data about how people viewed their whole life and the role of adoption in their life, with interviews lasting from 1-5 hours. The archive consists of the anonymised transcripts of in-depth interviews with the two groups of participants: (1) 38 people who were adopted as children and who have now become parents (20 mothers and 18 fathers, age range 21-54 years, mean = 33. Age at adoption varied from 0-12, with 60% being adopted over age 1 - median 1.5 years, mean 3.2 years). (2) 43 adoptive parents who are now grandparents through their adopted child/ren (23  grandmothers and 20 grandfathers, age range 47-75 years). This is almost the full dataset from the project - only 2 fathers withheld consent for their transcript to go in the archive. NB adopted adults are described as mothers or fathers; adoptive parents are described as grandmothers or grandfathers. Almost all participants were living in England and had adopted/been adopted in England. Small numbers were living in Scotland or Wales. Interviews took place in 2019-2020. Also archived is data about the demographics of the participants. About half the sample consisted of 'linked' cases - where more than one member of a family had taken part, and information is given about which interviews are linked to each other.  Finally, study materials are archived (leaflets, information and debrief sheets, interview schedules, demographic data collection form, consent form).For 20 years UK policy has encouraged the adoption of children from care, and tens of thousands are now of an age where they could become a parent. This compulsory form of adoption is controversial at home and abroad and it is vital to fully research the lifespan effects - including what happens when adoptees become parents to the next generation. A child's birth is a key event in any family, bringing joys and challenges. This study will provide a new understanding of the lived experiences and needs of people adopted from care who are now parents, and of adoptive parents who are now grandparents. It will inform support to help adopted young people to prepare for parenthood, promote their resilience, and support them as parents. \\nThe majority of children adopted from care will have experienced early adversities such as loss, abuse and neglect. Adoption offers permanence in a new family, but even so about half of adopted young people are likely to have psychological problems which carry on into adulthood. Studies of vulnerable parents (e.g. care leavers) show they are at risk of early parenthood, parenting difficulties, even their own children going into care. But for some, having a child is a positive choice and a healing experience. This study will explore the positives and the challenges of becoming a parent from the perspective of people adopted from care. The concept of 'resilience' (healthy development after exposure to risk) is key and the risk and protective factors that can affect resilience in the context of parenting will be a central focus.\\nThis study will also shine a light on the lifelong identity issues for adopted people. For adoptees, building identity can be hampered by gaps in their known life history, feelings of being different or stigmatised, and a lack of connection with birth relatives. Becoming a parent can stir up identity concerns and trigger a search for birth family, but these issues are unexplored for people adopted from care, many of whom will have retained some form of contact with birth relatives. We will explore how adopted people make meaning of their whole life history, including being adopted and being a parent, adding to our understanding of narrative identity development for adoptees in adulthood.\\nThe research will also include the perspective of parents who adopted a child from care and who are now grandparents. Adoption has lifelong implications for adopters too, but there is no research on the grandparenting stage of family life in 'from care' adoptions. Because of the ongoing vulnerability of many young people adopted from care, it is important to include grandparents because they may be providing vital support to their child and grandchild.\",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/life-story-interviews-with-adopted-adults-who-are-now-parents-and-adoptive-parents-who-are-now-grandparents-2018-2020\",\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-855382\"],\"keywords\":[\"ADOPTION\",\"PARENTS\",\"GRANDPARENTS\",\"ADOPTIVE PARENTS\",\"FAMILY LIFE\"],\"temporalCoverage\":\"2018-06-01/2020-11-30\"}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"17:T12ac,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"These data  were collected as part of an ESRC study exploring the experiences of adopted adults who were now parents, and adoptive parents who had become grandparents.

Becoming a parent can stir up identity concerns and trigger a search for birth family, but these issues are unexplored for people adopted from care, many of whom will have retained some form of contact with birth relatives. We will explore how adopted people make meaning of their whole life history, including being adopted and being a parent, adding to our understanding of narrative identity development for adoptees in adulthood.\nThe research will also include the perspective of parents who adopted a child from care and who are now grandparents. Adoption has lifelong implications for adopters too, but there is no research on the grandparenting stage of family life in 'from care' adoptions. Because of the ongoing vulnerability of many young people adopted from care, it is important to include grandparents because they may be providing vital support to their child and grandchild."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"10:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Life Story Interviews with Adopted Adults Who Are Now Parents and Adoptive Parents Who Are Now Grandparents, 2018-2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$18\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"Life Story Interviews with Adopted Adults Who Are Now Parents and Adoptive Parents Who Are Now Grandparents, 2018-2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"$19\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/life-story-interviews-with-adopted-adults-who-are-now-parents-and-adoptive-parents-who-are-now-grandparents-2018-2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:site_name\",\"content\":\"Academic Resource Discovery\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:locale\",\"content\":\"en_US\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:image:width\",\"content\":\"1200\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:image:height\",\"content\":\"630\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"og:image:alt\",\"content\":\"Life Story Interviews with Adopted Adults Who Are Now Parents and Adoptive Parents Who Are Now Grandparents, 2018-2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"website\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary_large_image\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"Life Story Interviews with Adopted Adults Who Are Now Parents and Adoptive Parents Who Are Now Grandparents, 2018-2020\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$1a\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"17\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:null\n"])</script></body></html>
