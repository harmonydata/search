As a result of a considerable team effort, the project has delivered a fully functioning, sophisticated, cross-platform app for data collection that has a visually pleasing design and smooth user interface and that is available to the public for participation. The app has yielded a rich data set containing self-report measures, questionnaires, and a set of ‘games” requiring choices and actions that are monitored. The data deposited here is the first tranche of data obtained and contains partial or complete entries from 389 registrants from 31 countries around the globe. The data set contains a range of measures concerning basic demographics, health, eating, exercise and lifestyle, economic well-being, and social network size. The data set also reports a range of personality measures. Many of the measures reported in the data set reflect performance on the various games in the app. The measures are either the proportion of times a particular choice was made, the average time it took to make that choice within each game, or an average rating scale measure of how participants felt after particular trials in the game. The games are (a) a risk-taking choice task, (b) a risk aversion game, (c) desire/belief game where the participant guesses the choices another person would make (d) a perspective taking game where the participant reports what s/he or another person can see, (e) a visual search task with different types of distractors, (f) a value learning task, and (g) a short term visual memory task.Do you feel just like you did when you were 20? Are you as mentally nimble? Are your intuitions better or worse? How have the years (or perhaps decades) of experience affected the way you make decisions about whether to exercise or eat healthily or how much to save for retirement? While few would doubt that they had changed during their adult life, the surprising working assumption in Psychology is that our thinking and decision-making abilities reach a plateau after the turmoil of adolescence and stay at about the same level, until we experience a relatively rapid decline in our post-retirement years. Our project will explore this supposed \"plateau\" in thinking capacity by testing predictions about which kinds of ability should improve or decline across five decades of adult life. This project could potentially transform current understanding of development across the lifespan and help develop a much better basis for understanding how and why cognitive problems onset with advanced age.\n\nThe project is timely for both societal and academic reasons. Adulthood is the period during which people make the greatest societal and economic contribution, making critical decisions about the health and economic future of themselves and others. We are currently in a period of significant demographic change, with growing numbers of older and elderly adults, many still in the workforce making important decisions. Academically, there is increasing recognition that reasoning and decision-making depends upon two distinct kinds of process, suited to faster \"intuitive\" and slower \"reflective\" decisions, and that our reasoning is more often \"hot\" than \"cold\", being strongly influenced by emotion and motivation. Understanding how these processes and factors influence cognition differently as we mature through adulthood is the central academic goal of the project. An additional very exciting aspect of our project is that we will combine our academic questions with a series of practical inquiries about how people make real decisions about their own health and lifestyle, allowing us to link theory and practice within the same project. \n\nOur methods are innovative and novel in their application to these questions. Though grounded in well-established laboratory tasks from developmental, cognitive, and social psychology, our primary source of data will come from custom made software apps installed on mobile tablets. We can use these apps to 'crowdsource' the data we need (by getting a large number of people to contribute), thereby using modern technologies to power our research. This will allow us to access a far larger number of participants who are more representative of the general population than those tested in typical laboratory studies.

Our methods are innovative and novel in their application to these questions. Though grounded in well-established laboratory tasks from developmental, cognitive, and social psychology, our primary source of data will come from custom made software apps installed on mobile tablets. We can use these apps to 'crowdsource' the data we need (by getting a large number of people to contribute), thereby using modern technologies to power our research. This will allow us to access a far larger number of participants who are more representative of the general population than those tested in typical laboratory studies. We will recruit people to help us with the study at a number of important public events (e.g., science and arts festivals) where we will also communicate to the public about our work.17:T125c,The main aim of this research project was to develop a cross-platform custom app to assess a wide range of higher cognitive processes in adults and to monitor how they change across the middle years of adulthood (25-65 years). As a result of a considerable team effort, the project has delivered a fully functioning, sophisticated, cross-platform app for data collection that has a visually pleasing design and smooth user interface and that is available to the public for participation. The app has yielded a rich data set containing self-report measures, questionnaires, and a set of ‘games” requiring choices and actions that are monitored. The data deposited here is the first tranche of data obtained and contains partial or complete entries from 389 registrants from 31 countries around the globe. The data set contains a range of measures concerning basic demographics, health, eating, exercise and lifestyle, economic well-being, and social network size. The data set also reports a range of personality measures. Many of the measures reported in the data set reflect performance on the various games in the app. The measures are either the proportion of times a particular choice was made, the average time it took to make that choice within each game, or an average rating scale measure of how participants felt after particular trials in the game. The games are (a) a risk-taking choice task, (b) a risk aversion game, (c) desire/belief game where the participant guesses the choices another person would make (d) a perspective taking game where the participant reports what s/he or another person can see, (e) a visual search task with different types of distractors, (f) a value learning task, and (g) a short term visual memory task.Do you feel just like you did when you were 20? Are you as mentally nimble? Are your intuitions better or worse? How have the years (or perhaps decades) of experience affected the way you make decisions about whether to exercise or eat healthily or how much to save for retirement? While few would doubt that they had changed during their adult life, the surprising working assumption in Psychology is that our thinking and decision-making abilities reach a plateau after the turmoil of adolescence and stay at about the same level, until we experience a relatively rapid decline in our post-retirement years. Our project will explore this supposed "plateau" in thinking capacity by testing predictions about which kinds of ability should improve or decline across five decades of adult life. This project could potentially transform current understanding of development across the lifespan and help develop a much better basis for understanding how and why cognitive problems onset with advanced age.

The project is timely for both societal and academic reasons. Adulthood is the period during which people make the greatest societal and economic contribution, making critical decisions about the health and economic future of themselves and others. We are currently in a period of significant demographic change, with growing numbers of older and elderly adults, many still in the workforce making important decisions. Academically, there is increasing recognition that reasoning and decision-making depends upon two distinct kinds of process, suited to faster "intuitive" and slower "reflective" decisions, and that our reasoning is more often "hot" than "cold", being strongly influenced by emotion and motivation.
