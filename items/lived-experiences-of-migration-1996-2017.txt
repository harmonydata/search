Additionally, 42 ‘prospective’ migrants were interviewed at home in Bulgaria, Romania, Italy, Spain about their plans to migrate in less than 12 months to a EU country. Further the collection contains 40 interviews with experts from public and private recruiting agencies. Additionally, three-page summaries of all interviews in English are included in the collection.The study focuses on the ‘lived’ experiences of migration. It builds upon the understanding that mobility is a complex and dynamic process starting with the decisions that are made before and along the journey and proceeding with examination of the challenges to migrants’ early adaptation, work and social integration, and the changes in their feelings of belonging and citizenship status. The research examines the impact of crosscutting factors such as gender, nationality, skill level and occupational sector. Using qualitative methodology of in-depth interviews, the study looks into the motivations, mobility channels and assessments that migrants make of the sending context, as well as of the receiving context – in terms of the climate of reception and levels of discrimination by employers, of the transferability of their own human capital and the success with which they will be admitted and encouraged to stay.
