2b:Tba8,The purpose of the project was to investigate the character of Liverpool society during the first century of its rapid commercial expansion, and in particular to address the question whether its social characteristics help to explain the dynamic nature of its economic growth.  The particular questions addressed include the origins of in-migrants to Liverpool, occupational structure and change, family and business networks, and the character of the governing elite and their use of power. The method was to input major sources for the history of Liverpool into computer files, to link names and compile information about Liverpool inhabitants.  This allowed information to be built up about geographical origins, occupations, wealth, residential location, family and business or political networks and inter-generational continuity in the town.  The topics covered by these data are:
