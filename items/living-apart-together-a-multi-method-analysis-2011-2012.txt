Strand 2: The semi-structured interviews covered details of current relationship, details of previous relationships, views on commitment, who they would turn to for practical, emotional and financial support, responsibilities in the relationship and views on legal rights of LATs. The interview also included an exercise where respondents were asked to create two lists, one with the people who were most important to the respondent and one with the people with whom they were closest to.

Strand 3: The Biographical Narrative Interpretive Method (BNIM) was used so respondents were asked to tell the story of their life and personal relationships and to include all the events and experiences which have been important to them.18:T1228,This is a mixed methods data collection. The research aimed to provide definitive evidence about the nature and experience of 'living apart together' (LAT) in Britain. While LATs feature in recent sociological literature and popular debate, there has been little systematic social research carried out into this type of relationship. There are also policy implications in how people who live apart together (LATs) live their family and personal lives.

The research had six linked objectives:to distinguish different types of LAT relationship, and to map the social location of those in LATs by class, age, and genderto map LAT social practices and relationshipsto evaluate the complex of biographical, material and psychosocial factors leading individuals to live apart togetherto examine the meanings, understandings and narratives produced by LATs about partnering, personal life, and caringto examine the benefits, ambivalences and stresses experienced by LATs, both materially and emotionallyto establish how far LATs represent a move 'beyond the family' or remain 'within the family'The project used a multi-method analysis based on three methodological strands. This was designed to yield both a detailed and representative description of LAT in Britain, and an in-depth knowledge of the practices, understandings, and feelings of people who live apart together.

Strand 1 consisted of a national survey of LATs in 2011. This included combined data from three statistically representative general population surveys. These were the NatCen Social Research Omnibus, the British Social Attitudes Survey (held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33168), and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Opinions Survey (held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33441). All three constituent surveys used face-to-face interviews, and were based on random probability sample designs in which interviewers were sent to a randomly selected list of addresses and then required to randomly select an individual to take part. The combined sample covers Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). The surveys identified 572 LATs.

Strand 2 took 50 semi-structured, conversational, interviews of around one hour with people in a LAT relationship, which accessed individual practices, meanings and understandings about living apart together in more depth. The sample took the national survey as a sampling frame in which respondents were purposively selected according to the reasons for living apart given in their survey responses. This had the advantage of creating an interview sample which - while not statistically representative – reflected the range and diversity of living apart together in Britain. Two interviews have not been archived due to consent restrictions; therefore the collection comprises of 48 interviews.

Strand 3 involved 16 different survey respondents, chosen purposively to reflect a diversity of life experience and LAT type, used biographical narrative interviews, to examine individual histories, subjectivities and narrative meaning-making practices in relation to LAT relationships. These data have a particular advantage of enabling us to look at how issues arose in-vivo in the course of self-directed narratives. Also included are 16 relationship maps which were created by respondents as part of the interview process.

In combination these three sources provide a comprehensive database for understanding living apart together relationships in Britain. Further information is available on the Centre for Applied Social Research's Living Apart Together project webpages and the ESRC Living Apart Together: a multi-method analysis webpage.

 Strand 1: Survey respondents were asked questions on their relationship history and plans, their relationship practices and understandings, why they lived apart together, and attitudes about LAT. Standard socio-demographic information was also collected.

Strand 2: The semi-structured interviews covered details of current relationship, details of previous relationships, views on commitment, who they would turn to for practical, emotional and financial support, responsibilities in the relationship and views on legal rights of LATs. The interview also included an exercise where respondents were asked to create two lists, one with the people who were most important to the respondent and one with the people with whom they were closest to.
