The Living in Wales survey closed in 2008.  From 2009/2010 onwards, it has been replaced by the National Survey for Wales (held at the Archive under GN 33435). Further information can be found on the Welsh Assembly Government Living in Wales web page.
 To enable analysis of the data at lower geographical levels than Wales, data files for a number of years have been combined. This has only been possible where the same questions have been asked in all the relevant years. 

Before analysing the 2006, 2007 and 2008 combined LIW data, users are recommended to download the documentation that accompanies the individual year datasets for 2006, 2007 and 2008, from:SN 6131 Living in Wales: Household Survey, 2006SN 6132 Living in Wales: Household Survey, 2007SN 6351 Living in Wales: Household Survey, 2008 The 2006, 2007 and 2008 combined data files include the following topics:household composition, ethnicity, religion, employmentdisability and long-term limiting illnesstravelquality of lifeinternet accessdiscriminationhousing historytenure/area featureseconomic statusincome10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Living in Wales: Household Survey; 2006, 2007 and 2008 Combined Data Files / LIW; Welsh Household and Dwelling Survey; Welsh House Condition Survey"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Living in Wales: Household Survey; 2006, 2007 and 2008 Combined Data Files / LIW; Welsh Household and Dwelling Survey; Welsh House Condition Survey"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/living-in-wales-household-survey-2006-2007-and-2008-combined-data-files-liw-welsh-household-and-dwelling-survey-welsh-house-condition-survey"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Living in Wales: Household Survey; 2006, 2007 and 2008 Combined Data Files / LIW; Welsh Household and Dwelling Survey; Welsh House Condition Survey"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Living in Wales: Household Survey; 2006, 2007 and 2008 Combined Data Files / LIW; Welsh Household and Dwelling Survey; Welsh House Condition Survey"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
