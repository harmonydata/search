The LIW survey had two separate but linked components: the Household Survey and the Property Survey.  The Household Survey was completed annually from 2004 and was conducted as a face-to-face interview with the household reference person (HRP) or another appropriate adult. It aimed to provide additional information to complement the Property Survey, but also to provide information about the community, the use of the Welsh language, the health of the members of the household, the values and opinions of the respondent as well as demographic characteristics. The Property Survey was conducted in 2004 and 2008 (held under SNs 7201 and 7202 respectively) and comprised an internal and external assessment of the property which was completed by a qualified surveyor. 

The Living in Wales survey closed in 2008.  From 2009/2010 onwards, it has been replaced by the National Survey for Wales (held at the Archive under GN 33435). Further information can be found on the Welsh Assembly Government Living in Wales web page.
