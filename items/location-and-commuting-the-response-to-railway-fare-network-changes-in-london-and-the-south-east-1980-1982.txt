2e:Tca3,This dataset consists of five separate surveys with varying purposes, as described below.
(a) Pilot survey at a central London office: to test both the method of distributing and collecting questionnaires via the internal mail system of the participating organisation and to assess the style and content of the questionnare.
(b) Central London Office employees survey: to gather information about those characteristics of individuals and attributes of their journey to work which might play an important role in determining their choice of home, or workplace, and means of commuting to work. Information was sought on those factors which may influence an individual's response to changes in the cost of rail travel and service level changes.
(c) Workplace interviews of recent home movers: to investigate aspects of the residential search process.
(d) Hertfordshire rail commuters survey: to investigate the impact of rail fare increases and service level changes on the locational and commuting behaviour of Central London commuters.
(e) Household and (f) Individual interviews in Hertfordshire: to obtain a detailed history of the household's composition since its formation (or within the last ten years, if shorter), enabling decisions about location or mode choice to be viewed against the appropriate circumstances.
