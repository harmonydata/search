Answers to frequently asked questions about LEO, and applying to use LEO, are available through the 'Accessing_LEO_via_ONS_SRS_I2_FAQ' link in the Associated Media section

Additional information:
The LEO via SRS Research Community is now available to join. The community and its knowledge base are for researchers who are interested in or who are currently accessing LEO data via the SRS. They allow researchers to access relevant information and to ask questions of each other regarding LEO analysis on the SRS. Additionally, they help DfE and ONS to make the LEO service as useful and accessible as possible and to develop the LEO knowledge base further. To access the community you require a Knowledge Hub (KHUB) account (https://khub.net/) and UKSA researcher Accreditation (https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/digitaleconomyact-research-statistics/better-useofdata-for-research-information-for-researchers/) . To gain access once you have a KHUB account and accreditation, please submit an access request to the community via https://khub.net/ and send an email to DfE’s LEO mailbox (leo.programme@education.gov.uk) with your UKSA accreditation number.
