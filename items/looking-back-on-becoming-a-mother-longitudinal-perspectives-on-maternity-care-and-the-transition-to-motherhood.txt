We will explore their reflections on what makes for a smooth transition to motherhood with positive long-term effects. This can be important on both a societal and personal level, taking into account: the long-term costs to society and mothers of depression and low emotional wellbeing; the desirability of avoiding dysfunctional families; and mothers' capacities to be part of the paid work force. We will also ask the women to reflect on the social and health care practices that contributed to their transitions to motherhood, and their subsequent experiences of such practices within the context of their own changing personal social situations.
