The surveys had, respectively, tested the intelligence of almost every child born in 1921 or 1936 and attending school in Scotland in those years. Therefore, tracing and re-testing people who had taken part in the Surveys much later in their lives offered a rare opportunity to examine the distribution and causes of cognitive ageing across most of the life course. The studies were initially set up to study the determinants of non-pathological cognitive ageing, rather than focussing principally on dementia or other pathological cognitive disorders.

Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 (LBC1921) is a longitudinal study that follows individuals who were part of the Scottish Mental Survey of 1932. This survey originally tested the intelligence of nearly all children born in 1921 and attending school in Scotland. The LBC1921 study aims to explore the factors influencing cognitive aging by re-assessing these individuals later in life. Participants have been followed up with multiple waves of data collection, including cognitive tests, health assessments, and lifestyle questionnaires. The study's primary focus is on understanding non-pathological cognitive aging, rather than dementia or other cognitive disorders. Key findings from the LBC1921 have contributed to the understanding of how early-life intelligence, health, and lifestyle factors influence cognitive abilities in older age. The study is significant for its unique longitudinal design, allowing researchers to track cognitive changes over an extensive period and providing insights into the aging process.\"}}]]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 (LBC1921)\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"The Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936 are follow-up studies of the Scottish Mental Surveys of 1932 and 1947.
