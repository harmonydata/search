The surveys had, respectively, tested the intelligence of almost every child born in 1921 or 1936 and attending school in Scotland in those years. Therefore, tracing and re-testing people who had taken part in the Surveys much later in their lives offered a rare opportunity to examine the distribution and causes of cognitive ageing across most of the life course. The studies were initially set up to study the determinants of non-pathological cognitive ageing, rather than focussing principally on dementia or other pathological cognitive disorders.
