UK government departments and devolved administrations will use this information to assess and develop policies relating to green job creation, potential growth and investment opportunities both nationally and regionally. The LCRES was conducted for the first time in 2015, for the reporting year 2014. Continuity between the first and second year of the survey was ensured with minimal changes made to the questionnaire in the second year.  The survey provides a number of high-level indicators of Low Carbon and Renewable Energy Economy (LCREE) activity such as turnover, number of businesses, imports, exports, employees and capital assets. Results from the LCRES can be used to show business activity in 17 specific sectors which can be aggregated into 6 LCREE groups.  All businesses with an employment of 250 or above are selected, together with a random sample of businesses from each of the other strata, defined by 2-digit SIC 2007 industry classification, country and employment size-band. Businesses that are randomly sampled are generally expected to remain in the sample for 2 years. Further information about the LCRES is available on the ONS web pages.Linking to other business studies
These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) reference
 numbers.  These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to 
business organisations.  Their inclusion allows researchers to combine 
different business survey sources together.  Researchers may consider 
applying for other business data to assist their research.For Secure Lab projects applying for access to this study as well as to SN 6697 Business Structure Database and/or SN 7683 Business Structure Database Longitudinal, only postcode-free versions of the data will be made available.Latest Edition Information For the ninth edition (September 2024), the 2022 data have been added to the study, and the 2020 and 2021 data have been updated, along with the User Guide and ONS data dictionaries. The dataset is produced from the results of the annual LCREE survey and allows for UK and country level estimates of turnover, employment, imports, exports, acquisitions and disposals from this part of the UK economy, broken down by seventeen sectors that make up the UK LCRES (onshore wind, offshore wind, solar, hydropower, other renewable electricity, bioenergy, alternative fuels, renewable heat, renewable combined heat and power, energy efficient lighting, energy efficient products, energy monitoring, saving or control systems, low carbon consultancy financial and advisory services, low emission vehicles and infrastructure, carbon capture and storage, nuclear power, fuel cells and energy storage system)."/><meta property="og:title" content="Low Carbon and Renewable Energy Economy Survey, 2014-2022: Secure Access / LCRES; UK LCRE; LCREE Survey; LCREES"/><meta property="og:description" content="The Low Carbon and Renewable Energy Economy Survey (LCRES) is an annual survey designed to collect information from businesses working within the green economy, including low carbon and renewable energy activities.

survey designed to collect information from businesses working within the green economy, including low carbon and renewable energy activities. UK government departments and devolved administrations will use this information to assess and develop policies relating to green job creation, potential growth and investment opportunities both nationally and regionally. The LCRES was conducted for the first time in 2015, for the reporting year 2014. Continuity between the first and second year of the survey was ensured with minimal changes made to the questionnaire in the second year.  The survey provides a number of high-level indicators of Low Carbon and Renewable Energy Economy (LCREE) activity such as turnover, number of businesses, imports, exports, employees and capital assets. Results from the LCRES can be used to show business activity in 17 specific sectors which can be aggregated into 6 LCREE groups.  All businesses with an employment of 250 or above are selected, together with a random sample of businesses from each of the other strata, defined by 2-digit SIC 2007 industry classification, country and employment size-band. Businesses that are randomly sampled are generally expected to remain in the sample for 2 years. Further information about the LCRES is available on the ONS web pages.Linking to other business studies\\nThese data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) reference\\n numbers.
