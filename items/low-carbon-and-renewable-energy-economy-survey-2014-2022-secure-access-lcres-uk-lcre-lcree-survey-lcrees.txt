Further information about the LCRES is available on the ONS web pages.Linking to other business studies
These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) reference
 numbers.  These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to 
business organisations.  Their inclusion allows researchers to combine 
different business survey sources together.  Researchers may consider 
applying for other business data to assist their research.For Secure Lab projects applying for access to this study as well as to SN 6697 Business Structure Database and/or SN 7683 Business Structure Database Longitudinal, only postcode-free versions of the data will be made available.Latest Edition Information For the ninth edition (September 2024), the 2022 data have been added to the study, and the 2020 and 2021 data have been updated, along with the User Guide and ONS data dictionaries.
