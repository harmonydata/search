The LCRES was conducted for the first time in 2015, for the reporting year 2014. Continuity between the first and second year of the survey was ensured with minimal changes made to the questionnaire in the second year.  The survey provides a number of high-level indicators of Low Carbon and Renewable Energy Economy (LCREE) activity such as turnover, number of businesses, imports, exports, employees and capital assets. Results from the LCRES can be used to show business activity in 17 specific sectors which can be aggregated into 6 LCREE groups.  All businesses with an employment of 250 or above are selected, together with a random sample of businesses from each of the other strata, defined by 2-digit SIC 2007 industry classification, country and employment size-band.
