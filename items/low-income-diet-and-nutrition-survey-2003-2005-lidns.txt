2b:Tbb4,In the United Kingdom, the diet and nutritional status of the general population is
monitored by the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) programme (held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33275). Results from the NDNS surveys indicate that differences exist in food consumption and nutritional status between lower and higher social economic groups.

The Low Income Diet and Nutrition Survey (LIDNS) was commissioned to provide for the first time robust, nationally representative, baseline data on food consumption, nutrient intake and nutritional status and factors affecting these in low-income/materially-deprived consumers. Data were collected between 2003 and 2005 and the survey report was published in July 2007. The survey included over 3,700 adults and children throughout the UK and had a number of components. It collected detailed quantitative information on food consumption, which was used to assess nutrient intakes. Physical measurements (e.g. height, weight, blood pressure) were also taken, and a blood sample for analysis of nutritional status indices. Finally, information on socio-economic, demographic and lifestyle characteristics was collected in a detailed interview and assessments of physical activity and oral health were made by questionnaire. 

Specific aims of LIDNS were toprovide quantitative data on the food and nutrient intakes, sources of nutrients and nutritional status of low-income groups describe the characteristics of individuals with intakes of specific nutrients above or below the national averageassess the diets of low-income consumers to determine the extent to which they are sufficiently nutritiousevaluate the extent to which the diets of low-income consumers vary from expert recommendationsprovide physical measurements of health-related factors closely associated with diet, namely height, weight and other anthropometric measurements and blood pressure for a representative sample of low-income individualsmeasure blood indices that provide evidence of nutritional status or dietary biomarkersassess physical activity levels of low-income groupsprovide basic information on smoking and oral health status in relation to dietexamine the relationship between dietary intake and factors affecting food choice in low-income groupsexamine possible relationships between diet and risk factors in later life. The survey questionnaires covered: household demographics; shopping habits; food preparation; cooking skills; food provided at school for children; eating habits; food avoidance and feeding advice; health; dental health; physical activity; smoking; alcohol consumption; education; employment; management of finances; household income; and coping strategies. Self-completion questionnaires were also given to children and young people aged 8-12, 13-15 and 16-24 years. In addition, a nurse visit was also conducted as part of the survey, to gather anthropometric measurements and blood samples.
