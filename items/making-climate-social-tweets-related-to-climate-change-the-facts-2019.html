Some commentators suggest that this is having profound effects across society, that social media has revolutionised the communication of controversial public issues such as climate change, and that this has significantly increased the volume and variety of scientists, politicians, journalists, non-governmental organisations, think tanks and members of the public in contact with each other. 
Tweets were collected in response to the airing of the BBC programme &quot;Climate Change: The Facts&quot;, broadcast on April 18th, 2019. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10095266/ https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m00049b1/climate-change-the-facts The data deposited is a list of 87,177 tweet IDs, which can be used to retrieve tweets.Social media is a transformative digital technology, collapsing the &quot;six degrees of separation&quot; which have previously characterised many social networks, and breaking down many of the barriers to individuals communicating with each other. Some commentators suggest that this is having profound effects across society, that social media has revolutionised the communication of controversial public issues such as climate change, and that this has significantly increased the volume and variety of scientists, politicians, journalists, non-governmental organisations, think tanks and members of the public in contact with each other. For example, in 2012 over 4000 tweets about climate change were sent every day. 

Social media communication can act as a trusted source of public information about climate change, foster public participation in climate science, be a campaigning tool and trigger polarising events with far-reaching effects (e.g. Climategate). However, despite these broad changes in the communication environment, we lack a detailed understanding of the characteristics of social media climate change communications, the wider contexts for these communications, and what the social media revolution means for the relationship between science, politics and publics. Using an innovative interdisciplinary methodological approach that combines social media big data analysis with fine grained ethnographic description, this project aims to: 1) discover the key contributors to social media climate change communication, the content they discuss, and how these change over time and space; 2) locate the connections between contributors, explore how social media usage is influenced by personal, professional and intellectual backgrounds, and how these influences vary over time and space; 3) identify the opportunities and challenges presented by social media for future public discussions of climate change. In this way, Making Climate Social will establish the contributors, content, connections and contexts which make up social media climate change communications, how these change over time and space, and what they mean for future public discussions of the science and politics of climate change. 

The Met Office is a project partner, hosting a knowledge exchange visit by the PI, where he will interact with key climate scientists, the Communications Team and Customer Centre and give a seminar to research staff in both climate and weather research. The PI will also meet regularly with the Met Office, Department for Energy and Climate Change and the cross-sector project Advisory Board to ensure that research findings reach and affect relevant audiences: i) academic audiences in science and technology studies, climate change communication and social media researchers; ii) publics interested in climate change and/or social media usage; iii) government, scientific organisations and universities with responsibility for supporting social media usage by climate change researchers. The project will achieve this through: i) high-quality research articles published in leading journals across a range of specialist academic journals; ii) a dedicated project blog, Twitter account @MakCliSoc, and series of Guardian blogposts to build awareness with, and disseminate findings to, a broad range of stakeholders and publics; iii) the Climate Change Social Radar: an innovative and interactive collaboration with digital developers to provide an engaging web interface through which to explore project data and reflect on broader ethical issues of social media; iv) succinct policy briefings tailored for key stakeholders and written in plain English."/><meta property="og:title" content="Making Climate Social: Tweets Related to &quot;Climate Change: The Facts&quot;, 2019"/><meta property="og:description" content="Social media is a transformative digital technology, collapsing the &quot;six degrees of separation&quot; which have previously characterised many social networks, and breaking down many of the barriers to individuals communicating with each other.
