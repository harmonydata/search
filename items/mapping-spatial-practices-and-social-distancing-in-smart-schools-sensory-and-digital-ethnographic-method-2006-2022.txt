Descriptions of the methods and protocols applied to the data collection are included in the respective folders. The folder also contains artifacts connected to the data analysis, including speculative maps and speculative 3D digital prototypes. The maps include: one map of living landscapes formed inside the school building, and one map of space-times mapping the journeys of students to school. Both maps have their keys. There is a map that presents the transformation of the urban territory around the school in the past 100 years. The 3D digital prototypes include images of the prototypes, a video animation and memos of how the prototypes connect and extend. Finally, in terms of dissemination, the folder contains drafts of publications finalised and in-process, and posters created for an exhibition of the project.28:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2c"}]
