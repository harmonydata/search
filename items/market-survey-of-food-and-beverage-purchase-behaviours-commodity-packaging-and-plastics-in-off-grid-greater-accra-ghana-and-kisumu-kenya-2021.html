and their packaging as sold at a sample of retail outlets in
urban Greater Accra, Ghana and Kisumu, Kenya. It also
comprises responses to a short shopper questionnaire and
all data were collected in areas classified as slums. The data
set was collected with the aim of quantifying packaging
waste associated with food and beverage purchases. It also
aimed to develop and evaluate a low-cost method for
identifying plastic resin types in resource-poor settings
lacking laboratory facilities. At each sampled retail outlet,
observations were made of vendor or consumer packaging
behaviours when food or beverage purchases took place.
Short interviews were conducted with shoppers. Where
foods or beverages were wrapped in plastics, packaging
samples were collected and further characterised in a basic
laboratory. Alongside recording labelling and other
packaging characteristics, the laboratory protocol also
completed a simple observation checklist (e.g. testing if
packaging floated; how it behaved on cutting), so as to infer
the packaging&#x27;s plastic resin type. The data set should thus
be of interest to researchers wishing to understand waste
generation and packaging in urban Africa.According to WHO/UNICEF, whilst 91.8% of urban households in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) had access to piped or protected groundwater sources in 2015, only 46.2% had safely managed water available when needed. Vendors provide a key role in supplying urban off-grid populations, with consumption of bottled or bagged water (sachets, water sold in 500ml plastic bags) growing in SSA. Whilst several studies show bottles and bags are usually free from faecal contamination, given that many off-grid urban populations lack solid waste disposal services, when people drink such water, there can be problems disposing of the plastic bags and bottles afterwards.
This project aims to deliver evidence on the different ways that people sell water to off-grid populations and what this means for plastic waste management. We plan to do this in Ghana, where most urban household now drink bagged water, and by way of contrast, Kenya, where the government has banned plastic bags. In this way, we want to widen access to safe water and waste management services among urban off-grid populations, by supporting water-sellers and waste collectors to fill the gaps in municipal services.
Both countries (and many others elsewhere) already have nationwide household surveys that collect data on the food and goods people consume and the services they have. However, as yet, these surveys have not been connected to the problem of waste management. We plan to visit marketplaces, buying foods and then recording packaging and organic waste. By combining this information with the household survey data, we can work out how much domestic waste like plastics gets collected and how much is discarded or burned, ultimately entering the atmosphere or oceans.
In Ghana, we will also survey informal waste collectors in urban Greater Accra. We want to find out how much these small businesses support waste collection and recycling across this urban region (particularly plastic from bagged water), so we can help government identify gaps in waste collection coverage. We also believe highlighting the important role of small waste collectors could lead to greater business support for such collectors. We will also evaluate whether community education campaigns to encourage domestic waste recycling reduce the amount of waste and plastic observed in the local environment. Such campaigns are currently pursued by several local charities with support from the Plastic Waste Management Project. 
In Kenya, where water is usually sold in jerrycans rather than bagged, the jerrycan water often gets contaminated. We plan to find out whether this jerrycan water is safer under an arrangement known as delegated management. This involves a water utility passing on management of the piped network to a local business in slum areas, so as to reduce vandalism of pipes and bring water closer to slum-dwellers. We will compare water quality in areas with and without this arrangement to see if it makes the water sold safer. We also plan to bring water-sellers and consumers together to find and test ways of reducing contamination of water between a jerry-can being filled and water being drunk at home. Rather than imposing a solution, we want to work together with vendors and consumers on this issue, but there are for example containers designed to keep water cleaner that we could explore."/><meta property="og:title" content="Market Survey of Food and Beverage Purchase Behaviours, Commodity Packaging and Plastics in Off-Grid Greater Accra, Ghana and Kisumu, Kenya, 2021"/><meta property="og:description" content="This data set comprises a market survey of foods and beverages

of foods and beverages\\nand their packaging as sold at a sample of retail outlets in\\nurban Greater Accra, Ghana and Kisumu, Kenya. It also\\ncomprises responses to a short shopper questionnaire and\\nall data were collected in areas classified as slums. The data\\nset was collected with the aim of quantifying packaging\\nwaste associated with food and beverage purchases. It also\\naimed to develop and evaluate a low-cost method for\\nidentifying plastic resin types in resource-poor settings\\nlacking laboratory facilities. At each sampled retail outlet,\\nobservations were made of vendor or consumer packaging\\nbehaviours when food or beverage purchases took place.\\nShort interviews were conducted with shoppers. Where\\nfoods or beverages were wrapped in plastics, packaging\\nsamples were collected and further characterised in a basic\\nlaboratory. Alongside recording labelling and other\\npackaging characteristics, the laboratory protocol also\\ncompleted a simple observation checklist (e.g. testing if\\npackaging floated; how it behaved on cutting), so as to infer\\nthe packaging's plastic resin type. The data set should thus\\nbe of interest to researchers wishing to understand waste\\ngeneration and packaging in urban Africa.According to WHO/UNICEF, whilst 91.8% of urban households in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) had access to piped or protected groundwater sources in 2015, only 46.2% had safely managed water available when needed. Vendors provide a key role in supplying urban off-grid populations, with consumption of bottled or bagged water (sachets, water sold in 500ml plastic bags) growing in SSA. Whilst several studies show bottles and bags are usually free from faecal contamination, given that many off-grid urban populations lack solid waste disposal services, when people drink such water, there can be problems disposing of the plastic bags and bottles afterwards.\\nThis project aims to deliver evidence on the different ways that people sell water to off-grid populations and what this means for plastic waste management. We plan to do this in Ghana, where most urban household now drink bagged water, and by way of contrast, Kenya, where the government has banned plastic bags. In this way, we want to widen access to safe water and waste management services among urban off-grid populations, by supporting water-sellers and waste collectors to fill the gaps in municipal services.\\nBoth countries (and many others elsewhere) already have nationwide household surveys that collect data on the food and goods people consume and the services they have. However, as yet, these surveys have not been connected to the problem of waste management. We plan to visit marketplaces, buying foods and then recording packaging and organic waste. By combining this information with the household survey data, we can work out how much domestic waste like plastics gets collected and how much is discarded or burned, ultimately entering the atmosphere or oceans.\\nIn Ghana, we will also survey informal waste collectors in urban Greater Accra. We want to find out how much these small businesses support waste collection and recycling across this urban region (particularly plastic from bagged water), so we can help government identify gaps in waste collection coverage. We also believe highlighting the important role of small waste collectors could lead to greater business support for such collectors. We will also evaluate whether community education campaigns to encourage domestic waste recycling reduce the amount of waste and plastic observed in the local environment. Such campaigns are currently pursued by several local charities with support from the Plastic Waste Management Project. \\nIn Kenya, where water is usually sold in jerrycans rather than bagged, the jerrycan water often gets contaminated. We plan to find out whether this jerrycan water is safer under an arrangement known as delegated management. This involves a water utility passing on management of the piped network to a local business in slum areas, so as to reduce vandalism of pipes and bring water closer to slum-dwellers. We will compare water quality in areas with and without this arrangement to see if it makes the water sold safer. We also plan to bring water-sellers and consumers together to find and test ways of reducing contamination of water between a jerry-can being filled and water being drunk at home.
