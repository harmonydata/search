The main aims of the earlier project were a) to conduct a detailed qualitative investigation into the transition to fatherhood and b) to explore the meaning of the men's accounts and experiences of becoming a father, taking into account the diverse social and cultural contexts of their lives and by attuning, also, to their subjective concerns, phenomenologies or sense-making. Under Timescapes the study was extended in a number of ways, including secondary analysis, interviews with an additional sample, and the use of innovative methodological techniques. A substantive and methodologically innovative meta- and re-analysis of existing longitudinal data collected in East Anglia before and after the birth of the men's first child was conducted to provide a more focused understanding of temporalities in the experiences of fathers over a time of intensive change in their lives. A fourth round of interviews with participants from the same sample provided a unique opportunity for a long-term follow up of the men as fathers almost a decade later. The sample was also widened to include a more diverse cohort of first-time fathers from South Wales, providing the means for comparative investigations across a geographically, socially and culturally diverse sample.
