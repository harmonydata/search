The overall aim of the proposed study is to understand better what and how British citizens have thought about formal politics since the late 1930s (when relevant datasets begin). This overall aim translates into three objectives: 1) to establish the range of popular understandings of politics among British citizens; 2) to establish changes in prominence of certain popular understandings over time; and 3) to suggest causes for these changes.

To achieve these objectives, three interconnected stages of research will be completed:
1. A contextual review of relevant and existing survey data will be used to establish broad trends, fluctuations, and cycles of public opinion regarding formal politics. Sources to be consulted, some of which date back to 1937, include Gallup poll results, National Opinion Poll results, and Ipsos-MORI results.
2. Analysis of qualitative data found in the Mass Observation Archive. On eight occasions between 1945 and 2010, hundreds of Mass-Observation panellists were asked to write about politicians, elections, and political parties. Responses will be analysed for displays of shared understandings of politics in British society at particular historical moments.
3. Integration of findings from the historical research - stages 1 and 2 - with relevant contemporary research including work from the last decade involving the ESRC and the Hansard Society seeking to audit political engagement in twenty-first century Britain.

Potential benefits for politicians, political parties, civil servants, social scientists, and, ultimately, citizens include: a better knowledge of various popular understandings of formal politics and how these have changed over the decades; a better understanding of how people think and act - and come to think and act - in relation to formal politics; a better understanding of the historical specificity and, related to that, the likely causes of current disenchantment and disengagement from formal politics; a set of evidence-based reform options in the field of democratic renewal; and, ultimately, if such reform options are taken up, the increased engagement of citizens with the democratic process, and more legitimate and effective government.18:T119e,In Spring 2014, the Mass Observation Project asked its panel of volunteer writers the following questions:

Consider the following people: a) Politicians; b) Doctors; c) Lawyers; d) Scientists. Do you associate any characteristics with each group? If you were in conversation with somebody and these kinds of people were referred to, what would be your attitude be?

How do you feel about: a) David Cameron; b) Ed Miliband; c) Nick Clegg; d) William Hague; e) George Osborne? Please feel free to share any other comments about any other politicians.

How do you feel about: a) The Conservative Party; b) The Labour Party; c) The Liberal Democrats; d) The Scottish National Party; e) The UK Independence Party? We are interested in your immediate reaction to these political parties, but would also like to know more about how your attitude towards them has developed over the years.

Turnout at the most recent General Election in 2010 was 65.1%. This is an increase on the previous Election, but still the third lowest figure since 1945. Is it important to vote? Could anything be done to increase the number of people voting?

How much interest do you and other people you know take in local elections? How important do you think that they are? Did you vote in your last local election? Do you consider your local council to be an effective/ineffective one? Why?

175 responses were received, ranging from a couple of lines to many pages in length. They are archived at the Mass Observation Archive, University of Sussex.There is alienation and withdrawal from formal politics in many countries at the present time. In Britain, election turnout, party membership, and trust in politicians are all declining. This worries governments who respond with policies to renew democracy. But such policies have struggled because the causes for such disenchantment and disengagement are not clear. Relationships between measures of political participation and numerous other variables, from levels of political corruption to levels of social capital, have been explored. But few clear patterns have emerged. Missing from research to date on this topic are the voices of citizens, in which can be found their shifting understandings, expectations, and judgements regarding politics and politicians.
