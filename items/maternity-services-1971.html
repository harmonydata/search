The surveys are, therefore, very specific in nature and the subjects covered diverse. The Data Archive holds 19 such surveys.
Readers are asked to note that, with the exception of the surveys on the Telephone Service - 69004, 69016, respondents surveyed are self selected from subscribers to the Association&#x27;s magazine &lt;i&gt;Which?&lt;/i&gt; and so the surveys cannot singly be used in descriptive accounts of the British public.
Surveys 69005-69012 cover various aspects of the housing experiences of &lt;i&gt;Which?&lt;/i&gt; readers who moved house in 1967 and 1968. It is here particularly important to remember that the choice strategies and the resources of &lt;i&gt;Which?&lt;/i&gt; readers are unlikely to be typical.  Data include whether child was born in: hospital; GP unit; home or in a nursing home.
Ante-natal care: where received; number of visits; type of classes attended; travelling time to and from classes etc.; waiting time; satisfaction with care and information given; and, finally, any criticisms of the service.
Home births: satisfaction with arrangements; whether husband was present during labour/delivery; whether doctor was present; whether respondent had enough help with coping with pain; whether midwife encouraged the use of relaxation methods learnt in ante-natal classes. Any difficulties encountered in the birth are noted together with the distance from home to the nearest hospital maternity unit. Arrangements made for other children whilst mother was giving birth are recorded. Post-natal data include: whether respondent felt she got enough rest in the first week after baby&#x27;s birth; whether baby or mother was referred to hospital during the first 2 weeks after birth; respondent satisfaction with care received. Finally, she is asked to state the advantages and disadvantages of having a baby at home.
Birth in hospital (nursing home or GP unit): choice available; difficulties in getting to hospital (including distance from home to hospital); how long before birth respondent was admitted (and whether she was in labour on admittance); whether respondent had seen the labour and maternity wards before having baby or whether she was an in-patient during pregnancy (i.e. but discharged before birth); whether respondent was encouraged during labour to use relaxation techniques learnt; whether she felt that she had enough personal attention; whether husband was present (i.e. during labour and delivery) - hospital policy on this is noted; whether baby was delivered by doctor; whether respondent felt that she had enough help with coping with pain. Any difficulties in the baby&#x27;s birth are noted. Post-natal information includes: number of beds in ward respondent was in after baby&#x27;s birth; amount seen of baby whilst in hospital; whether respondent bottle fed or breast fed and whether nurses and midwives were helpful with feeding and other problems (a record is made of advice and information received, particularly whether this was ever conflicting). Also the respondent is asked to assess the bathroom and lavatory facilities available and the general atmosphere in the hospital (e.g. whether friendly). The length of time spent in hospital after baby&#x27;s birth is recorded and respondent satisfaction with care received is noted. Finally, she is asked to list the advantages and disadvantages of having a baby in hospital.
Background Variables
Age cohort, occupation of head of household, family income, number of children (with ages), birth of youngest child, and finally, a record of where each of the children was born (i.e. hospital, home, GP unit or nursing home)."/><meta property="og:title" content="Maternity Services, 1971"/><meta property="og:description" content="Data accumulated from Consumers&#x27; Association surveys are designed to be used by the consumer.
