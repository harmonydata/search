The experiments aimed at understanding possible sources of heterogeneity in important economic outcomes such as saving and wealth accumulation.

The second experiment, concerning intertemporal decision making, was conducted in June and September 2011 with 1,425 panel members. Subjects were presented with a sequence of decision problems: under uncertainty in the first experiment and over time in the second experiment.
