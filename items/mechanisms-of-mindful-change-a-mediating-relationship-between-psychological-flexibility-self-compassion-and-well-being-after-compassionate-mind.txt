Hypothesis two (H2) stated that participants’ levels of well-being and compassionate engagement and action would have significant positive correlations with each other and measures of psychological flexibility, suggesting possible mediating factors between them. After data analysis, the results of this study supported the first hypothesis, revealing significant increases in self-compassionate engagement and action and well-being, as well as unexpected increases in psychological flexibility. In terms of the second hypothesis, a serial mediation analysis supported previous theoretical accounts and studies which have suggested that the soothing benefits of compassion are mediated via mindfulness, a process which, in this study appeared to be represented by the psychological flexibility dimensions of present-moment-awareness, defusion and self-as-context in that mediating order.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Mechanisms of Mindful Change: A Mediating Relationship Between Psychological Flexibility, Self-compassion, and Well-being after Compassionate Mind Training, 2022"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Mechanisms of Mindful Change: A Mediating Relationship Between Psychological Flexibility, Self-compassion, and Well-being after Compassionate Mind Training, 2022"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/mechanisms-of-mindful-change-a-mediating-relationship-between-psychological-flexibility-self-compassion-and-well-being-after-compassionate-mind"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Mechanisms of Mindful Change: A Mediating Relationship Between Psychological Flexibility, Self-compassion, and Well-being after Compassionate Mind Training, 2022"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Mechanisms of Mindful Change: A Mediating Relationship Between Psychological Flexibility, Self-compassion, and Well-being after Compassionate Mind Training, 2022"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
