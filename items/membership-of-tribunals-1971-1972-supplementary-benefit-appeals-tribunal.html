Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
The survey assesses member&#x27;s prior knowledge of, and familiarity with, the work of Appeals Tribunals and method of choice of members (i.e. whether through personal application or through suggestion of individual or organisation). Respondents are asked for their opinion of reasons for their selection, and whether they were appointed as Minister&#x27;s nominee or as Trades Council nominee. If the member has been promoted to Chairman since his appointment, the importance of remuneration is obtained. If he is an ordinary member, the importance of fee for service and any eventual financial loss to the member through service are ascertained.
Respondent, opinion on frequency of sittings of tribunals, necessary experience, qualifications and personal qualities required of a good chairman and effective ordinary member, and own personal satisfaction or dissatisfaction in service are elicited. In a final section, comments are invited on methods of recruiting and selecting members, on changes needed in kinds of people appointed, and on the general work of Tribunals.
Background Variables
Age, highest formal education or professional qualifications, status of employment (i.e. whether self-employed, employed, retired or housewife), last paid occupation, husband&#x27;s occupation (if housewife), judicial or semi-judicial or committee experience (with details and dates), membership of professional, occupational or trade union organisations and any voluntary work done during the period, 1962 - 72.
