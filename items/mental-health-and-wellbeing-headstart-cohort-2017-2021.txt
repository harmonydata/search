The six HeadStart partnerships were based in Blackpool, Cornwall, Hull, Kent, Newham and Wolverhampton. As a test and learn programme, the HeadStart programme ended in July 2022, with many of the approaches having been sustained and embedded locally. The national evaluation of HeadStart was completed in May 2023.During each year of HeadStart, young people from schools involved in the HeadStart programme completed survey questionnaires. The survey contained the following measures: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale; Student Resilience Survey; Self-regulation subscale of TEIQue-ASF; and a 4-item version of the Perceived Stress Scale. Young carer status was measured using the following question: \"Young carers are children and young people under 18 who provide regular or ongoing care to a family member who has an illness, disability, mental health condition or drug/alcohol dependency.\"The survey collection in 2021 also included questions about gender and sexual identity (only completed by Year 11s), as well as information on adolescents' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (completed by Year 9s and 11s).Data were collected from two samples.
