It was conducted by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on behalf of the Department of Health (now known as the Department of Health and Social Care, or DHSC), The Scottish Health Executive and the National Assembly for Wales. The following survey in the series was conducted in 2002 and focused on children looked after by their local authority. The third survey was conducted in 2004 and collected information from 5 to 16-year-olds. Follow-ups to this survey were conducted after 6 months and again after 3 years.NHS Digital commissioned the 2017 survey on behalf of the DHSC. It collected information on 2 to 19-year-olds living in England. The survey was carried out by a consortium led by NatCen Social Research, which included the ONS and Youth In Mind.The MHCYP 2020 survey was a Wave 1 follow-up to the 2017 survey and was conducted under the COVID-19 Public Health Directions 2020, as directed by the then Secretary of State for Health. The Wave 2 follow-up was conducted in 2021, and Wave 3 in 2022.Further information can be found on the NHS Digital Mental Health of Children and Young People Surveys webpage.A similar series covering adults, the Adult Surveys of Psychiatric Morbidity, is also commissioned by NHS Digital.  The primary purpose of the Mental Health of Children and Adolescents in Great Britain, 1999 survey was to produce prevalence rates  of three main categories of mental disorder:  
conduct disorder; 
hyperactivity; 
emotional disorders (and their comorbidity); 
based on ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, tenth   revision) and DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth  revision) criteria. Where there were sufficient numbers, the survey  also aimed to provide prevalence rates of type of problem (e.g.,  separation anxiety, social phobia etc.) and to investigate the  comorbidity or co-occurrence of disorders.  The data contain Information about 10, 438 children from up to 3 sources:
Parent/primary care giver;
Young person (11-15 year olds) themselves;
Teacher (nominated by parent/child);
Clinical assessment variables assigned to each case based on ICD-10 and DSM-IV diagnostic criteria.  (Clinical raters carried out a review of all survey data for each child and assigned diagnoses).
