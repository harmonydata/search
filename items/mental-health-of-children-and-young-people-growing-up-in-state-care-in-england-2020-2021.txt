The Wave 2 survey data contains information on 681 children and young people in care from 14 LAs in England. Of these, 262 children and young people responded to both the Wave 1 and 2 survey.Around two-thirds of children are taken into State care due to experiences of severe maltreatment such as abuse or neglect.

Despite this, numerous research studies indicate that mental health concerns in this vulnerable child population remains very high. Mental ill health experienced in childhood and adolescence impacts the short and long-term health, well-being, socioeconomic trajectories and family life of children and young people. This also exerts pressure and a financial toll on the health and social care systems, and the State through its impact on mental health services, the cost of interventions and pressure on State benefits systems.
