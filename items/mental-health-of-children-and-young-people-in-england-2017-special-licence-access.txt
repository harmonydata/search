The MHCYP 2017 collected information about mental health and well-being from a stratified probability sample of children and young people living in England and registered with a GP. Information was collected on 9,117 children aged 2 to 19 between January and October 2017. The survey combines reports from children, their parents and teachers (depending on the age of the selected child). This survey for the first time provides findings on the prevalence of the mental disorder in 2 to 4-year-olds and spans the transition into adulthood by covering 17 to 19-year-olds. 

The main aims of the survey were:

to collect robust data on a range of topics relating to the mental health of children and young people;to estimate what proportion of children and young people in England are living with a mental disorder (and the types of mental disorders experienced);produce trends in disorders through comparisons with previous surveys in the seriesenable the circumstances of children and young people with different mental disorders to be compared with those of children and young people without;improve understanding of the state of children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing;inform the design of mental health services for children and young people.

The third survey was conducted in 2004 and collected information from 5 to 16-year-olds. Follow-ups to this survey were conducted after 6 months and again after 3 years.NHS Digital commissioned the 2017 survey on behalf of the DHSC.
