It was conducted by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on behalf of the Department of Health (now known as the Department of Health and Social Care, or DHSC), The Scottish Health Executive and the National Assembly for Wales. The following survey in the series was conducted in 2002 and focused on children looked after by their local authority. The third survey was conducted in 2004 and collected information from 5 to 16-year-olds. Follow-ups to this survey were conducted after 6 months and again after 3 years.NHS Digital commissioned the 2017 survey on behalf of the DHSC. It collected information on 2 to 19-year-olds living in England. The survey was carried out by a consortium led by NatCen Social Research, which included the ONS and Youth In Mind.The MHCYP 2020 survey was a Wave 1 follow-up to the 2017 survey and was conducted under the COVID-19 Public Health Directions 2020, as directed by the then Secretary of State for Health. The Wave 2 follow-up was conducted in 2021, and Wave 3 in 2022.Further information can be found on the NHS Digital Mental Health of Children and Young People Surveys webpage.A similar series covering adults, the Adult Surveys of Psychiatric Morbidity, is also commissioned by NHS Digital.  The main aims of the Mental Health of Children and Young People in Great Britain, 2004 survey were:to examine whether there were any changes between 1999 and 2004 in the prevalence of the three main categories of mental disorder: conduct disorders, emotional disorders and hyperkinetic disordersto describe the characteristics and behaviour patterns of children in each main disorder category and subgroups within those categoriesto look in more detail at children with autistic spectrum disorderto examine the relationship between mental disorder and aspects of children’s lives not covered in the previous survey, for example, medication, absence from school, empathy and social capitalto collect baseline information to enable identification of the protective and risk factors associated with the main categories of disorder and the precursors of personality disorder through future follow-up surveys The data file contains:a subset of information collected in the previous 1999 survey on 10,438 children aged 5-15; these variables included those which were repeated in comparable form in 2004. The full 1999 dataset has also been deposited at UKDA (see &#x27;Abstract&#x27; section above)the full data collected in the 2004 survey on 7,977 children aged 5-16any potentially disclosive variables have been removedInformation was provided for the survey from up to three sources: the primary care giver, the child/young person (aged 11-15/16 years) and the child/young person’s teacher (nominated by child/parent).

Topics covered in the 2004 survey included: housing, general health, strengths and difficulties, friendship, development, separation anxiety, social and specific phobias, panic attacks and agoraphobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, compulsions and obsessions, generalised anxiety, depression, self-harm, attention and activity, awkward and troublesome behaviours, eating disorders, tics, personality issues, stress and life events, school exclusions. Some data were gathered by self-completion, for example drink and drug use (from child/young person) and parent&#x27;s/parents&#x27; education, employment, income, strengths and difficulties (parent).

Clinical raters reviewed the survey data from all sources and then assigned International Classification of Diseases (ICD_10) ratings as necessary (see the documentation for a full description of the methodology). The file also contains derived variables (specifications provided).

It was conducted by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on behalf of the Department of Health (now known as the Department of Health and Social Care, or DHSC), The Scottish Health Executive and the National Assembly for Wales. The following survey in the series was conducted in 2002 and focused on children looked after by their local authority. The third survey was conducted in 2004 and collected information from 5 to 16-year-olds. Follow-ups to this survey were conducted after 6 months and again after 3 years.NHS Digital commissioned the 2017 survey on behalf of the DHSC. It collected information on 2 to 19-year-olds living in England. The survey was carried out by a consortium led by NatCen Social Research, which included the ONS and Youth In Mind.The MHCYP 2020 survey was a Wave 1 follow-up to the 2017 survey and was conducted under the COVID-19 Public Health Directions 2020, as directed by the then Secretary of State for Health.
