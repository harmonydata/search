These surveys are conducted periodically and involve a large, stratified probability sample, which includes interviews with children, young people, their parents, and teachers. The primary objective is to gather reliable data on various aspects of mental health and wellbeing among this demographic. The findings from these surveys are crucial for understanding trends and changes in mental health over time, identifying risk factors, and informing the development and implementation of mental health services and policies tailored to the needs of children and young people. The data collected helps in shaping interventions and supports aimed at improving mental health outcomes for this population."}}]]
