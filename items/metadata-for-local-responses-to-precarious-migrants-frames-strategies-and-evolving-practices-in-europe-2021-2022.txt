Through case studies conducted in Cardiff, Frankfurt, and Vienna, in collaboration with city councils and stakeholder consultations, the initiative examined various service delivery methods within different legal environments, highlighting the cooperation between public services and civil society. Interviews were conducted with policy makers and service providers, and NGOs regarding the experiences of migrants with precarious status. A total of 21 interviews were recorded with experts in Wales, in Cardiff in particular. To reach these experts, we partnered with the city of Cardiff and were granted access to various local authorities and NGOs. The data cannot be shared due to the protocols used.This project aims at mapping and enhancing local strategies to address the exclusion from essential services of migrants with precarious residential status. It will explore the challenges migrants face, emphasising the particular experiences of women, the services available in some cities such as healthcare and shelter, and the rationales for them. Case studies in Cardiff, Frankfurt and Vienna, in partnership with city councils and consultation with stakeholders, will explore differing approaches to provision within contrasting legal frameworks, including collaboration between public services and civil society. The project will strengthen transnational networking and knowledge exchange, to inform and enhance future practice.\nMigrants with precarious immigration status present a significant challenge to European municipalities. Largely excluded from work and welfare services as a matter of law, their exclusion runs counter to the socio-economic goals of urban policies, undermining strategies to promote social integration, participation and sustainable development. Groundbreaking research by the applicants, and a unique, Oxford university led, 3 year knowledge-exchange programme engaging European cities, have explored city practices towards inclusion of these migrants in municipal services.
