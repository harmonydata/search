migrant children from a child-centred perspective. Therefore, a mixture of online and paper surveys that assessed various aspects of wellbeing and school life were carried out with both migrant and none migrant children aged 9-17 years, including groups of new arrivals, long-term migrants and local children. The topics covered in the surveys included life satisfaction, leisure activities, satisfaction with school, friendship, relationships with peers and teachers and experiences of bullying. The surveys also collected demographic information including age, ethnicity, religion, gender, language, citizenship, area of residence, socioeconomic status and language. children were also questioned regarding their migratory status. This allowed for analysis to be carried out based on different characteristics.The overall objective of the project is to stimulate the inclusion of diverse groups of migrant children by adopting a childcentred approach to their integration at the educational and policy level. Stemming from the need to revisit the integration policies on the one hand and consistent with the specific focus of the call on the other hand, the research project aims at comprehensive examination of contemporary integration processes of migrant children in order to empower them. The project starts from the fact that European countries and their education systems encounter manifold challenges due to growing ethnic, cultural, linguistic diversity and thereby aims at: 1) Identifying existing measures for the integration of migrant children at the regional and local level through secondary data analysis; 2) Analysis of the social impacts of these integration programmes through case studies in ten countries applying qualitative and quantitative child-centred research; 3) Development of integration measures and identification of social investment particularly in educational policies and school systems that aim to empower children. The project is problem-driven and exploratory at the same time.
