The research set  itself five more specific objectives, as follows: i) to review the existing  literature on migration behaviour and residential preferences relating to  the city; ii) to identify the cities and parts of cities which in the  recent past have proved more able to attract and hold on to residents  and examine the characteristics that distinguish these places; iii) to  investigate the extent to which different population groups are  participating in these residential movements and seek out the reasons  behind these differences; iv) to evaluate the implications of these  findings for policy development; and v) to contribute to the theoretical  literature on urban change.
