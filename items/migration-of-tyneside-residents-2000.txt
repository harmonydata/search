This  project, one of 23 funded by the ESRC Cities Programme sought to improve  understanding of the factors which bind, attract and repel residents in  the larger cities and their inner areas. The project approached this task  from the perspective of migration and residential mobility, focusing on  overall population trends and the role of migration in these, social  differences in the migration balances of Britain's largest conurbations,  and the factors influencing people's migration behaviour. The research set  itself five more specific objectives, as follows: i) to review the existing  literature on migration behaviour and residential preferences relating to  the city; ii) to identify the cities and parts of cities which in the  recent past have proved more able to attract and hold on to residents  and examine the characteristics that distinguish these places; iii) to  investigate the extent to which different population groups are  participating in these residential movements and seek out the reasons  behind these differences; iv) to evaluate the implications of these  findings for policy development; and v) to contribute to the theoretical  literature on urban change.  The work was carried out as a set of eight  sub-projects, which included studies in collaboration with the Housing  Corporation, Newcastle City Council and colleagues at Newcastle University.  The survey of Tyneside residents was one of these sub-projects.  The primary purpose of this survey was to obtain better intelligence  about the causes of recent population movements affecting Newcastle and  the surrounding region. The survey was undertaken by household  questionnaire, which asked about how long people have lived at their  present address, about the place they had moved from and the reason for  their move, about their current intentions of moving and about basic  demographic characteristics.  The principal focus of the survey was on  people living in and around Newcastle that have moved home within the  last five years or so, i.e. since the start of 1995. It was targeted  primarily at households of family-raising age or older moving into owner  occupied housing. The survey was focused on ten, fairly compact localities.  Half are located within the City boundary, four of them containing  significant amounts of relatively new housing (Little Benton, Gosforth,  Blakelaw/Kingston Park, Westerhope) and one picked as representative of a  more established family area (Jesmond). The five in the surrounding region  were selected on the basis of containing much new housing and being located  in an area that has traditionally been popular among those moving out of  Newcastle (Gateshead/Ryton, Prudhoe, Ponteland/Darras Hall, West Allotment,  Cramlington).","url":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/migration-of-tyneside-residents-2000","identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-4631-1"],"keywords":[]}15:Tb58,This survey was carried out as part of a study entitled 'Migration,  residential preferences and the changing environment of cities'.

The work was carried out as a set of eight  sub-projects, which included studies in collaboration with the Housing  Corporation, Newcastle City Council and colleagues at Newcastle University.  The survey of Tyneside residents was one of these sub-projects.  The primary purpose of this survey was to obtain better intelligence  about the causes of recent population movements affecting Newcastle and  the surrounding region. The survey was undertaken by household  questionnaire, which asked about how long people have lived at their  present address, about the place they had moved from and the reason for  their move, about their current intentions of moving and about basic  demographic characteristics.  The principal focus of the survey was on  people living in and around Newcastle that have moved home within the  last five years or so, i.e. since the start of 1995. It was targeted  primarily at households of family-raising age or older moving into owner  occupied housing. The survey was focused on ten, fairly compact localities.  Half are located within the City boundary, four of them containing  significant amounts of relatively new housing (Little Benton, Gosforth,  Blakelaw/Kingston Park, Westerhope) and one picked as representative of a  more established family area (Jesmond). The five in the surrounding region  were selected on the basis of containing much new housing and being located  in an area that has traditionally been popular among those moving out of  Newcastle (Gateshead/Ryton, Prudhoe, Ponteland/Darras Hall, West Allotment,  Cramlington).e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Migration of Tyneside Residents, 2000"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Migration of Tyneside Residents, 2000"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/migration-of-tyneside-residents-2000"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Migration of Tyneside Residents, 2000"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Migration of Tyneside Residents, 2000"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
