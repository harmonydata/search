The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is a large-scale, multi-purpose longitudinal dataset providing information about babies born at the beginning of the 21st century, their progress through life, and the families who are bringing them up, for the four countries of the United Kingdom. The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were:to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born at the start of the 21st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will requireto provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229)to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers&#x27; involvement in children&#x27;s care and developmentto focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children&#x27;s &#x27;background&#x27;, charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may beto emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents&#x27; own childhoodto investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when availableAdditional objectives subsequently included for MCS were:to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion)to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom, and include disadvantaged areas of EnglandFurther information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies web pages.The content of MCS studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website. The first sweep (MCS1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, the fifth sweep (MCS5) in 2012-2013, when they were eleven years old, the sixth sweep (MCS6) in 2015, when they were fourteen years old, and the seventh sweep (MCS7) in 2018, when they were seventeen years old.
End User Licence versions of MCS studies:The End User Licence (EUL) versions of MCS1, MCS2, MCS3, MCS4, MCS5, MCS6 and MCS7 are held under UK Data Archive SNs 4683, 5350, 5795, 6411, 7464, 8156 and 8682 respectively. The longitudinal family file is held under SN 8172.

Sub-sample studies:
Some studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see EUL SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see EUL SN 5614).Release of Sweeps 1 to 4 to Long Format (Summer 2020)To support longitudinal research and make it easier to compare data from different time points, all data from across all sweeps is now in a consistent format. The update affects the data from sweeps 1 to 4 (from 9 months to 7 years), which are updated from the old/wide to a new/long format to match the format of data of sweeps 5 and 6 (age 11 and 14 sweeps). The old/wide formatted datasets contained one row per family with multiple variables for different respondents. The new/long formatted datasets contain one row per respondent (per parent or per cohort member) for each MCS family. Additional updates have been made to all sweeps to harmonise variable labels and enhance anonymisation.

Secure Access datasets:
Secure Access versions of the MCS have more restrictive access conditions than versions available under the standard End User Licence or Special Licence (see &#x27;Access data&#x27; tab above).

Secure Access versions of the MCS include:detailed sensitive variables not available under EUL. These have been grouped thematically and are held under SN 8753 (socio-economic, accommodation and occupational data), SN 8754 (self-reported health, behaviour and fertility), SN 8755 (demographics, language and religion) and SN 8756 (exact participation dates).

CLS/ NHS Digital Sub-licence agreement
NHS Digital has given CLS permission for onward sharing of the MCS/HES dataset via the UKDS Secure Lab. In order to ensure data minimisation, NHS Digital require that researchers only access the HES variables needed for their approved research project. Therefore, the HES linked data provided by the UKDS to approved researchers will be subject to sub-setting of variables. The researcher will need to request a specific sub-set of variables from the MCS HES data dictionary, which will subsequently be made available within their UKDS Secure Account. Once the researcher has finished their research, the UKDS will delete the tailored dataset for that specific project.

Any party wishing to access the data deposited at the UK Data Service will be required to enter into a Licence agreement with CLS (UCL), in addition to the agreements signed with the UKDS. The UKDS will include the &#x27;CLS Licence Agreement for Linked NHS Digital data&#x27; in the documentation pack provided to researchers at the point of registration. UCL researchers will need to complete the &#x27;CLS Licence Agreement for Linked NHS Digital data-UCL researchers&#x27;.

The Licensee shall acknowledge in any publication, whether printed, electronic or broadcast, based wholly or in part on such materials, both the source of the data and UCL. An example of an appropriate acknowledgement can be found on the CLS Citing our data webpage.  CLS Hospital Episode Statistics data access update July 2025From March 2027, HES data linked to all four CLS studies will no longer be available via the UK Data Service. For projects ending before March 2027, uses should continue to apply via UKDS. However, if access to a wider range of linked Longitudinal Population Studies data is needed, UKLLC might be more suitable. For projects ending after March 2027, users must apply via UKLLC. Latest edition informationFor the third edition (July 2025), the Consent Linkage data file has been updated to correct nine cases misclassified as &#x27;no data returned&#x27;. The user guide has also been updated to reflect these figures.
The data cover diverse topics including: diagnosis, maternity, mortality, mental health, types of therapies, lengths of treatment, Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), service providers, organisations, and regional geographical location."/><meta property="og:title" content="Millennium Cohort Study: Linked Health Administrative Datasets (Hospital Episode Statistics), England, 2000-2023: Secure Access"/><meta property="og:description" content="Background:

The Millennium Cohort Study: Linked Health Administrative Datasets (Hospital Episode Statistics), England, 2000-2023: Secure Access (SN 9030) includes data files from the NHS Digital HES database for those cohort members who provided consent to health data linkage in the Age 17 sweep. The HES database contains information about all hospital admissions in England. The following linked HES data are available:

1)            Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) 
The A&amp;E dataset details each attendance to an Accident and Emergency care facility in England, between 01-04-2007 and 31-03-2020 (inclusive). It includes major A&amp;E departments, single specialty A&amp;E departments, minor injury units and walk in centres in England.

2)            Admitted Patient Care (APC)
The APC data summarises episodes of care for admitted patients, where the episode occurred between 01-04-2001and 31-03-2023  (inclusive).

3)            Critical Care (CC)
The CC dataset covers records of critical care activity between 01-04-2008 and 31-03-2023 (inclusive).

4)            Out Patient (OP)
The OP dataset lists the outpatient appointments between 01-04-2003 and 31-03-2023 (inclusive).

5)           Emergency Care Dataset (ECDS)
The ECDS contains emergency care appointments from 01-04-2017 to 31-03-2023 (inclusive).
6)          Consent dataThe consents dataset describes consent to linkage, and is current at the time of deposit.

CLS/ NHS Digital Sub-licence agreement
NHS Digital has given CLS permission for onward sharing of the MCS/HES dataset via the UKDS Secure Lab. In order to ensure data minimisation, NHS Digital require that researchers only access the HES variables needed for their approved research project. Therefore, the HES linked data provided by the UKDS to approved researchers will be subject to sub-setting of variables. The researcher will need to request a specific sub-set of variables from the MCS HES data dictionary, which will subsequently be made available within their UKDS Secure Account. Once the researcher has finished their research, the UKDS will delete the tailored dataset for that specific project.

Any party wishing to access the data deposited at the UK Data Service will be required to enter into a Licence agreement with CLS (UCL), in addition to the agreements signed with the UKDS. The UKDS will include the &#x27;CLS Licence Agreement for Linked NHS Digital data&#x27; in the documentation pack provided to researchers at the point of registration. UCL researchers will need to complete the &#x27;CLS Licence Agreement for Linked NHS Digital data-UCL researchers&#x27;.

The Licensee shall acknowledge in any publication, whether printed, electronic or broadcast, based wholly or in part on such materials, both the source of the data and UCL. An example of an appropriate acknowledgement can be found on the CLS Citing our data webpage.  CLS Hospital Episode Statistics data access update July 2025From March 2027, HES data linked to all four CLS studies will no longer be available via the UK Data Service. For projects ending before March 2027, uses should continue to apply via UKDS. However, if access to a wider range of linked Longitudinal Population Studies data is needed, UKLLC might be more suitable. For projects ending after March 2027, users must apply via UKLLC. Latest edition informationFor the third edition (July 2025), the Consent Linkage data file has been updated to correct nine cases misclassified as &#x27;no data returned&#x27;. The user guide has also been updated to reflect these figures.
The data cover diverse topics including: diagnosis, maternity, mortality, mental health, types of therapies, lengths of treatment, Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), service providers, organisations, and regional geographical location."/><meta name="twitter:image" content="https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"/><link rel="icon" href="/search/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"

class="MuiBox-root mui-twhvv7"><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Millennium Cohort Study: Linked Health Administrative Datasets (Hospital Episode Statistics), England, 2000-2023: Secure Access","description":"Background:\nThe Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is a large-scale, multi-purpose longitudinal dataset providing information about babies born at the beginning of the 21st century, their progress through life, and the families who are bringing them up, for the four countries of the United Kingdom. The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were:to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born at the start of the 21st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will requireto provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229)to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and developmentto focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may beto emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhoodto investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when availableAdditional objectives subsequently included for MCS were:to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion)to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom, and include disadvantaged areas of EnglandFurther information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies web pages.The content of MCS studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website. The first sweep (MCS1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, the fifth sweep (MCS5) in 2012-2013, when they were eleven years old, the sixth sweep (MCS6) in 2015, when they were fourteen years old, and the seventh sweep (MCS7) in 2018, when they were seventeen years old.\nEnd User Licence versions of MCS studies:The End User Licence (EUL) versions of MCS1, MCS2, MCS3, MCS4, MCS5, MCS6 and MCS7 are held under UK Data Archive SNs 4683, 5350, 5795, 6411, 7464, 8156 and 8682 respectively. The longitudinal family file is held under SN 8172.\n\nSub-sample studies:\nSome studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see EUL SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see EUL SN 5614).Release of Sweeps 1 to 4 to Long Format (Summer 2020)To support longitudinal research and make it easier to compare data from different time points, all data from across all sweeps is now in a consistent format. The update affects the data from sweeps 1 to 4 (from 9 months to 7 years), which are updated from the old/wide to a new/long format to match the format of data of sweeps 5 and 6 (age 11 and 14 sweeps). The old/wide formatted datasets contained one row per family with multiple variables for different respondents. The new/long formatted datasets contain one row per respondent (per parent or per cohort member) for each MCS family. Additional updates have been made to all sweeps to harmonise variable labels and enhance anonymisation.  \n\nHow to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:For information on how to access biomedical data from MCS that are not held at the UKDS, see the CLS Genetic data and biological samples webpage.\n\nSecure Access datasets:\nSecure Access versions of the MCS have more restrictive access conditions than versions available under the standard End User Licence or Special Licence (see 'Access data' tab above).\n\nSecure Access versions of the MCS include:detailed sensitive variables not available under EUL. These have been grouped thematically and are held under SN 8753 (socio-economic, accommodation and occupational data), SN 8754 (self-reported health, behaviour and fertility), SN 8755 (demographics, language and religion) and SN 8756 (exact participation dates). These files replace previously available studies held under SNs 8456 and 8622-8627detailed geographical identifier files which are grouped by sweep held under SN 7758 (MCS1), SN 7759 (MCS2), SN 7760 (MCS3), SN 7761 (MCS4), SN 7762 (MCS5 2001 Census Boundaries), SN 7763 (MCS5 2011 Census Boundaries), SN 8231 (MCS6 2001 Census Boundaries), SN 8232 (MCS6 2011 Census Boundaries), SN 8757 (MCS7), SN 8758 (MCS7 2001 Census Boundaries) and SN 8759 (MCS7 2011 Census Boundaries). These files replace previously available files grouped by geography SN 7049 (Ward level), SN 7050 (Lower Super Output Area level), and SN 7051 (Output Area level)linked education administrative datasets for Key Stages 1, 2, 4 and 5 held under SN 8481 (England).  This replaces previously available datasets for Key Stage 1 (SN 6862) and Key Stage 2 (SN 7712)linked education administrative datasets for Key Stage 1 held under SN 7414 (Scotland)linked education administrative dataset for Key Stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 under SN 9085 (Wales)linked NHS Patient Episode Database for Wales (PEDW) for MCS1 – MCS5 held under SN 8302linked Scottish Medical Records data held under SNs 8709, 8710, 8711, 8712, 8713 and 8714;Banded Distances to English Grammar Schools for MCS5 held under SN 8394linked Health Administrative Datasets (Hospital Episode Statistics) for England for years 2000-2019 held under SN 9030linked Health Administrative Datasets (SAIL) for Wales held under SN 9310linked Hospital of Birth data held under SN 5724.The linked education administrative datasets held under SNs 8481,7414 and 9085 may be ordered alongside the MCS detailed geographical identifier files only if sufficient justification is provided in the application. Researchers applying for access to the Secure Access MCS datasets should indicate on their ESRC Accredited Researcher application form the EUL dataset(s) that they also wish to access (selected from the MCS Series Access web page).\n\n\nThe Millennium Cohort Study: Linked Health Administrative Datasets (Hospital Episode Statistics), England, 2000-2023: Secure Access (SN 9030) includes data files from the NHS Digital HES database for those cohort members who provided consent to health data linkage in the Age 17 sweep. The HES database contains information about all hospital admissions in England. The following linked HES data are available:\n\n1)            Accident and Emergency (A&E) \nThe A&E dataset details each attendance to an Accident and Emergency care facility in England, between 01-04-2007 and 31-03-2020 (inclusive). It includes major A&E departments, single specialty A&E departments, minor injury units and walk in centres in England.\n\n2)            Admitted Patient Care (APC)\nThe APC data summarises episodes of care for admitted patients, where the episode occurred between 01-04-2001and 31-03-2023  (inclusive).\n\n3)            Critical Care (CC)\nThe CC dataset covers records of critical care activity between 01-04-2008 and 31-03-2023 (inclusive).\n\n4)            Out Patient (OP)\nThe OP dataset lists the outpatient appointments between 01-04-2003 and 31-03-2023 (inclusive).\n\n5)           Emergency Care Dataset (ECDS)\nThe ECDS contains emergency care appointments from 01-04-2017 to 31-03-2023 (inclusive).\n6)          Consent dataThe consents dataset describes consent to linkage, and is current at the time of deposit.\n\nCLS/ NHS Digital Sub-licence agreement\nNHS Digital has given CLS permission for onward sharing of the MCS/HES dataset via the UKDS Secure Lab. In order to ensure data minimisation, NHS Digital require that researchers only access the HES variables needed for their approved research project. Therefore, the HES linked data provided by the UKDS to approved researchers will be subject to sub-setting of variables. The researcher will need to request a specific sub-set of variables from the MCS HES data dictionary, which will subsequently be made available within their UKDS Secure Account. Once the researcher has finished their research, the UKDS will delete the tailored dataset for that specific project.\n\nAny party wishing to access the data deposited at the UK Data Service will be required to enter into a Licence agreement with CLS (UCL), in addition to the agreements signed with the UKDS. The UKDS will include the 'CLS Licence Agreement for Linked NHS Digital data' in the documentation pack provided to researchers at the point of registration. UCL researchers will need to complete the 'CLS Licence Agreement for Linked NHS Digital data-UCL researchers'.\n\nThe Licensee shall acknowledge in any publication, whether printed, electronic or broadcast, based wholly or in part on such materials, both the source of the data and UCL. An example of an appropriate acknowledgement can be found on the CLS Citing our data webpage.  CLS Hospital Episode Statistics data access update July 2025From March 2027, HES data linked to all four CLS studies will no longer be available via the UK Data Service. For projects ending before March 2027, uses should continue to apply via UKDS.

The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is a large-scale, multi-purpose longitudinal dataset providing information about babies born at the beginning of the 21st century, their progress through life, and the families who are bringing them up, for the four countries of the United Kingdom. The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were:to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born at the start of the 21st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will requireto provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229)to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers&#x27; involvement in children&#x27;s care and developmentto focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children&#x27;s &#x27;background&#x27;, charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may beto emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents&#x27; own childhoodto investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when availableAdditional objectives subsequently included for MCS were:to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion)to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom, and include disadvantaged areas of EnglandFurther information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies web pages.The content of MCS studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website. The first sweep (MCS1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, the fifth sweep (MCS5) in 2012-2013, when they were eleven years old, the sixth sweep (MCS6) in 2015, when they were fourteen years old, and the seventh sweep (MCS7) in 2018, when they were seventeen years old.
End User Licence versions of MCS studies:The End User Licence (EUL) versions of MCS1, MCS2, MCS3, MCS4, MCS5, MCS6 and MCS7 are held under UK Data Archive SNs 4683, 5350, 5795, 6411, 7464, 8156 and 8682 respectively. The longitudinal family file is held under SN 8172.

Sub-sample studies:
Some studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see EUL SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see EUL SN 5614).Release of Sweeps 1 to 4 to Long Format (Summer 2020)To support longitudinal research and make it easier to compare data from different time points, all data from across all sweeps is now in a consistent format. The update affects the data from sweeps 1 to 4 (from 9 months to 7 years), which are updated from the old/wide to a new/long format to match the format of data of sweeps 5 and 6 (age 11 and 14 sweeps). The old/wide formatted datasets contained one row per family with multiple variables for different respondents. The new/long formatted datasets contain one row per respondent (per parent or per cohort member) for each MCS family. Additional updates have been made to all sweeps to harmonise variable labels and enhance anonymisation.  

How to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:For information on how to access biomedical data from MCS that are not held at the UKDS, see the CLS Genetic data and biological samples webpage.

Secure Access datasets:
Secure Access versions of the MCS have more restrictive access conditions than versions available under the standard End User Licence or Special Licence (see &#x27;Access data&#x27; tab above).

Secure Access versions of the MCS include:detailed sensitive variables not available under EUL. These have been grouped thematically and are held under SN 8753 (socio-economic, accommodation and occupational data), SN 8754 (self-reported health, behaviour and fertility), SN 8755 (demographics, language and religion) and SN 8756 (exact participation dates). These files replace previously available studies held under SNs 8456 and 8622-8627detailed geographical identifier files which are grouped by sweep held under SN 7758 (MCS1), SN 7759 (MCS2), SN 7760 (MCS3), SN 7761 (MCS4), SN 7762 (MCS5 2001 Census Boundaries), SN 7763 (MCS5 2011 Census Boundaries), SN 8231 (MCS6 2001 Census Boundaries), SN 8232 (MCS6 2011 Census Boundaries), SN 8757 (MCS7), SN 8758 (MCS7 2001 Census Boundaries) and SN 8759 (MCS7 2011 Census Boundaries). These files replace previously available files grouped by geography SN 7049 (Ward level), SN 7050 (Lower Super Output Area level), and SN 7051 (Output Area level)linked education administrative datasets for Key Stages 1, 2, 4 and 5 held under SN 8481 (England).  This replaces previously available datasets for Key Stage 1 (SN 6862) and Key Stage 2 (SN 7712)linked education administrative datasets for Key Stage 1 held under SN 7414 (Scotland)linked education administrative dataset for Key Stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 under SN 9085 (Wales)linked NHS Patient Episode Database for Wales (PEDW) for MCS1 – MCS5 held under SN 8302linked Scottish Medical Records data held under SNs 8709, 8710, 8711, 8712, 8713 and 8714;Banded Distances to English Grammar Schools for MCS5 held under SN 8394linked Health Administrative Datasets (Hospital Episode Statistics) for England for years 2000-2019 held under SN 9030linked Health Administrative Datasets (SAIL) for Wales held under SN 9310linked Hospital of Birth data held under SN 5724.The linked education administrative datasets held under SNs 8481,7414 and 9085 may be ordered alongside the MCS detailed geographical identifier files only if sufficient justification is provided in the application. Researchers applying for access to the Secure Access MCS datasets should indicate on their ESRC Accredited Researcher application form the EUL dataset(s) that they also wish to access (selected from the MCS Series Access web page).


The Millennium Cohort Study: Linked Health Administrative Datasets (Hospital Episode Statistics), England, 2000-2023: Secure Access (SN 9030) includes data files from the NHS Digital HES database for those cohort members who provided consent to health data linkage in the Age 17 sweep. The HES database contains information about all hospital admissions in England. The following linked HES data are available:

1)            Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) 
The A&amp;E dataset details each attendance to an Accident and Emergency care facility in England, between 01-04-2007 and 31-03-2020 (inclusive). It includes major A&amp;E departments, single specialty A&amp;E departments, minor injury units and walk in centres in England.

2)            Admitted Patient Care (APC)
The APC data summarises episodes of care for admitted patients, where the episode occurred between 01-04-2001and 31-03-2023  (inclusive).

3)            Critical Care (CC)
The CC dataset covers records of critical care activity between 01-04-2008 and 31-03-2023 (inclusive).

4)            Out Patient (OP)
The OP dataset lists the outpatient appointments between 01-04-2003 and 31-03-2023 (inclusive).

5)           Emergency Care Dataset (ECDS)
The ECDS contains emergency care appointments from 01-04-2017 to 31-03-2023 (inclusive).
6)          Consent dataThe consents dataset describes consent to linkage, and is current at the time of deposit.

CLS/ NHS Digital Sub-licence agreement
NHS Digital has given CLS permission for onward sharing of the MCS/HES dataset via the UKDS Secure Lab. In order to ensure data minimisation, NHS Digital require that researchers only access the HES variables needed for their approved research project. Therefore, the HES linked data provided by the UKDS to approved researchers will be subject to sub-setting of variables. The researcher will need to request a specific sub-set of variables from the MCS HES data dictionary, which will subsequently be made available within their UKDS Secure Account. Once the researcher has finished their research, the UKDS will delete the tailored dataset for that specific project.

Any party wishing to access the data deposited at the UK Data Service will be required to enter into a Licence agreement with CLS (UCL), in addition to the agreements signed with the UKDS. The UKDS will include the &#x27;CLS Licence Agreement for Linked NHS Digital data&#x27; in the documentation pack provided to researchers at the point of registration. UCL researchers will need to complete the &#x27;CLS Licence Agreement for Linked NHS Digital data-UCL researchers&#x27;.

The Licensee shall acknowledge in any publication, whether printed, electronic or broadcast, based wholly or in part on such materials, both the source of the data and UCL. An example of an appropriate acknowledgement can be found on the CLS Citing our data webpage.  CLS Hospital Episode Statistics data access update July 2025From March 2027, HES data linked to all four CLS studies will no longer be available via the UK Data Service. For projects ending before March 2027, uses should continue to apply via UKDS. However, if access to a wider range of linked Longitudinal Population Studies data is needed, UKLLC might be more suitable. For projects ending after March 2027, users must apply via UKLLC. Latest edition informationFor the third edition (July 2025), the Consent Linkage data file has been updated to correct nine cases misclassified as &#x27;no data returned&#x27;. The user guide has also been updated to reflect these figures.
The data cover diverse topics including: diagnosis, maternity, mortality, mental health, types of therapies, lengths of treatment, Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), service providers, organisations, and regional geographical location.</p><div class="MuiBox-root mui-10c8zph"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 mui-k2l056">Show More</p><svg

large-scale, multi-purpose longitudinal dataset providing information about babies born at the beginning of the 21st century, their progress through life, and the families who are bringing them up, for the four countries of the United Kingdom. The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were:to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born at the start of the 21st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will requireto provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229)to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and developmentto focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may beto emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhoodto investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when availableAdditional objectives subsequently included for MCS were:to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion)to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom, and include disadvantaged areas of EnglandFurther information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies web pages.The content of MCS studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website. The first sweep (MCS1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, the fifth sweep (MCS5) in 2012-2013, when they were eleven years old, the sixth sweep (MCS6) in 2015, when they were fourteen years old, and the seventh sweep (MCS7) in 2018, when they were seventeen years old.\\nEnd User Licence versions of MCS studies:The End User Licence (EUL) versions of MCS1, MCS2, MCS3, MCS4, MCS5, MCS6 and MCS7 are held under UK Data Archive SNs 4683, 5350, 5795, 6411, 7464, 8156 and 8682 respectively. The longitudinal family file is held under SN 8172.\\n\\nSub-sample studies:\\nSome studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see EUL SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see EUL SN 5614).Release of Sweeps 1 to 4 to Long Format (Summer 2020)To support longitudinal research and make it easier to compare data from different time points, all data from across all sweeps is now in a consistent format. The update affects the data from sweeps 1 to 4 (from 9 months to 7 years), which are updated from the old/wide to a new/long format to match the format of data of sweeps 5 and 6 (age 11 and 14 sweeps). The old/wide formatted datasets contained one row per family with multiple variables for different respondents. The new/long formatted datasets contain one row per respondent (per parent or per cohort member) for each MCS family. Additional updates have been made to all sweeps to harmonise variable labels and enhance anonymisation.  \\n\\nHow to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:For information on how to access biomedical data from MCS that are not held at the UKDS, see the CLS Genetic data and biological samples webpage.\\n\\nSecure Access datasets:\\nSecure Access versions of the MCS have more restrictive access conditions than versions available under the standard End User Licence or Special Licence (see 'Access data' tab above).\\n\\nSecure Access versions of the MCS include:detailed sensitive variables not available under EUL.

In order to ensure data minimisation, NHS Digital require that researchers only access the HES variables needed for their approved research project. Therefore, the HES linked data provided by the UKDS to approved researchers will be subject to sub-setting of variables. The researcher will need to request a specific sub-set of variables from the MCS HES data dictionary, which will subsequently be made available within their UKDS Secure Account. Once the researcher has finished their research, the UKDS will delete the tailored dataset for that specific project.\\n\\nAny party wishing to access the data deposited at the UK Data Service will be required to enter into a Licence agreement with CLS (UCL), in addition to the agreements signed with the UKDS. The UKDS will include the 'CLS Licence Agreement for Linked NHS Digital data' in the documentation pack provided to researchers at the point of registration. UCL researchers will need to complete the 'CLS Licence Agreement for Linked NHS Digital data-UCL researchers'.\\n\\nThe Licensee shall acknowledge in any publication, whether printed, electronic or broadcast, based wholly or in part on such materials, both the source of the data and UCL. An example of an appropriate acknowledgement can be found on the CLS Citing our data webpage.  CLS Hospital Episode Statistics data access update July 2025From March 2027, HES data linked to all four CLS studies will no longer be available via the UK Data Service. For projects ending before March 2027, uses should continue to apply via UKDS. However, if access to a wider range of linked Longitudinal Population Studies data is needed, UKLLC might be more suitable. For projects ending after March 2027, users must apply via UKLLC. Latest edition informationFor the third edition (July 2025), the Consent Linkage data file has been updated to correct nine cases misclassified as 'no data returned'. The user guide has also been updated to reflect these figures.\\nThe data cover diverse topics including: diagnosis, maternity, mortality, mental health, types of therapies, lengths of treatment, Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), service providers, organisations, and regional geographical location.\",\"url\":\"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/millennium-cohort-study-linked-health-administrative-datasets-hospital-episode-statistics-england-2000-2023-secure-access\",\"keywords\":[\"Migration and immigration\",\"Social care - need\",\"Work and employment\",\"Language and literacy\",\"Reproductive health\",\"Diet and nutrition\",\"Covid-19 data collection\",\"Education\",\"Sexuality and gender identity\",\"Physical health assessment\",\"Loneliness and social isolation\",\"Neighbourhood\",\"Digital technology and social media\",\"Social care - provision\",\"Housing\",\"Sleep problems\",\"Socioeconomic status and deprivation\",\"Political and social attitudes\",\"Ethnicity and race\",\"Puberty\",\"Parenting and family\",\"Victimisation and life events\",\"Cognitive measures\",\"Social care - receipt\"],\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-9030-3\"],\"includedInDataCatalog\":[{\"@type\":\"DataCatalog\",\"name\":\"UK Data Service\",\"url\":\"https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=9030\"}],\"size\":\"56744\"}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"12:T29e3,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Background:\nThe Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is a large-scale, multi-purpose longitudinal dataset providing information about babies born at the beginning of the 21st century, their progress through life, and the families who are bringing them up, for the four countries of the United Kingdom.

The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were:to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born at the start of the 21st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will requireto provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229)to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and developmentto focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may beto emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhoodto investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when availableAdditional objectives subsequently included for MCS were:to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion)to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom, and include disadvantaged areas of EnglandFurther information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies web pages.The content of MCS studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website. The first sweep (MCS1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, the fifth sweep (MCS5) in 2012-2013, when they were eleven years old, the sixth sweep (MCS6) in 2015, when they were fourteen years old, and the seventh sweep (MCS7) in 2018, when they were seventeen years old.\nEnd User Licence versions of MCS studies:The End User Licence (EUL) versions of MCS1, MCS2, MCS3, MCS4, MCS5, MCS6 and MCS7 are held under UK Data Archive SNs 4683, 5350, 5795, 6411, 7464, 8156 and 8682 respectively.

Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see EUL SN 5614).Release of Sweeps 1 to 4 to Long Format (Summer 2020)To support longitudinal research and make it easier to compare data from different time points, all data from across all sweeps is now in a consistent format. The update affects the data from sweeps 1 to 4 (from 9 months to 7 years), which are updated from the old/wide to a new/long format to match the format of data of sweeps 5 and 6 (age 11 and 14 sweeps). The old/wide formatted datasets contained one row per family with multiple variables for different respondents. The new/long formatted datasets contain one row per respondent (per parent or per cohort member) for each MCS family.

The third sweep (MCS3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, the fifth sweep (MCS5) in 2012-2013, when they were eleven years old, the sixth sweep (MCS6) in 2015, when they were fourteen years old, and the seventh sweep (MCS7) in 2018, when they were seventeen years old.\nEnd User Licence versions of MCS studies:The End User Licence (EUL) versions of MCS1, MCS2, MCS3, MCS4, MCS5, MCS6 and MCS7 are held under UK Data Archive SNs 4683, 5350, 5795, 6411, 7464, 8156 and 8682 respectively. The longitudinal family file is held under SN 8172.\n\nSub-sample studies:\nSome studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see EUL SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see EUL SN 5614).Release of Sweeps 1 to 4 to Long Format (Summer 2020)To support longitudinal research and make it easier to compare data from different time points, all data from across all sweeps is now in a consistent format. The update affects the data from sweeps 1 to 4 (from 9 months to 7 years), which are updated from the old/wide to a new/long format to match the format of data of sweeps 5 and 6 (age 11 and 14 sweeps). The old/wide formatted datasets contained one row per family with multiple variables for different respondents. The new/long formatted datasets contain one row per respondent (per parent or per cohort member) for each MCS family. Additional updates have been made to all sweeps to harmonise variable labels and enhance anonymisation.  \n\nHow to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:For information on how to access biomedical data from MCS that are not held at the UKDS, see the CLS Genetic data and biological samples webpage.\n\nSecure Access datasets:\nSecure Access versions of the MCS have more restrictive access conditions than versions available under the standard End User Licence or Special Licence (see 'Access data' tab above).\n\nSecure Access versions of the MCS include:detailed sensitive variables not available under EUL. These have been grouped thematically and are held under SN 8753 (socio-economic, accommodation and occupational data), SN 8754 (self-reported health, behaviour and fertility), SN 8755 (demographics, language and religion) and SN 8756 (exact participation dates). These files replace previously available studies held under SNs 8456 and 8622-8627detailed geographical identifier files which are grouped by sweep held under SN 7758 (MCS1), SN 7759 (MCS2), SN 7760 (MCS3), SN 7761 (MCS4), SN 7762 (MCS5 2001 Census Boundaries), SN 7763 (MCS5 2011 Census Boundaries), SN 8231 (MCS6 2001 Census Boundaries), SN 8232 (MCS6 2011 Census Boundaries), SN 8757 (MCS7), SN 8758 (MCS7 2001 Census Boundaries) and SN 8759 (MCS7 2011 Census Boundaries). These files replace previously available files grouped by geography SN 7049 (Ward level), SN 7050 (Lower Super Output Area level), and SN 7051 (Output Area level)linked education administrative datasets for Key Stages 1, 2, 4 and 5 held under SN 8481 (England).  This replaces previously available datasets for Key Stage 1 (SN 6862) and Key Stage 2 (SN 7712)linked education administrative datasets for Key Stage 1 held under SN 7414 (Scotland)linked education administrative dataset for Key Stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 under SN 9085 (Wales)linked NHS Patient Episode Database for Wales (PEDW) for MCS1 – MCS5 held under SN 8302linked Scottish Medical Records data held under SNs 8709, 8710, 8711, 8712, 8713 and 8714;Banded Distances to English Grammar Schools for MCS5 held under SN 8394linked Health Administrative Datasets (Hospital Episode Statistics) for England for years 2000-2019 held under SN 9030linked Health Administrative Datasets (SAIL) for Wales held under SN 9310linked Hospital of Birth data held under SN 5724.The linked education administrative datasets held under SNs 8481,7414 and 9085 may be ordered alongside the MCS detailed geographical identifier files only if sufficient justification is provided in the application. Researchers applying for access to the Secure Access MCS datasets should indicate on their ESRC Accredited Researcher application form the EUL dataset(s) that they also wish to access (selected from the MCS Series Access web page).\n\n\nThe Millennium Cohort Study: Linked Health Administrative Datasets (Hospital Episode Statistics), England, 2000-2023: Secure Access (SN 9030) includes data files from the NHS Digital HES database for those cohort members who provided consent to health data linkage in the Age 17 sweep. The HES database contains information about all hospital admissions in England. The following linked HES data are available:\n\n1)            Accident and Emergency (A\u0026E) \nThe A\u0026E dataset details each attendance to an Accident and Emergency care facility in England, between 01-04-2007 and 31-03-2020 (inclusive). It includes major A\u0026E departments, single specialty A\u0026E departments, minor injury units and walk in centres in England.\n\n2)            Admitted Patient Care (APC)\nThe APC data summarises episodes of care for admitted patients, where the episode occurred between 01-04-2001and 31-03-2023  (inclusive).\n\n3)            Critical Care (CC)\nThe CC dataset covers records of critical care activity between 01-04-2008 and 31-03-2023 (inclusive).\n\n4)            Out Patient (OP)\nThe OP dataset lists the outpatient appointments between 01-04-2003 and 31-03-2023 (inclusive).\n\n5)           Emergency Care Dataset (ECDS)\nThe ECDS contains emergency care appointments from 01-04-2017 to 31-03-2023 (inclusive).\n6)          Consent dataThe consents dataset describes consent to linkage, and is current at the time of deposit.\n\nCLS/ NHS Digital Sub-licence agreement\nNHS Digital has given CLS permission for onward sharing of the MCS/HES dataset via the UKDS Secure Lab. In order to ensure data minimisation, NHS Digital require that researchers only access the HES variables needed for their approved research project. Therefore, the HES linked data provided by the UKDS to approved researchers will be subject to sub-setting of variables. The researcher will need to request a specific sub-set of variables from the MCS HES data dictionary, which will subsequently be made available within their UKDS Secure Account. Once the researcher has finished their research, the UKDS will delete the tailored dataset for that specific project.\n\nAny party wishing to access the data deposited at the UK Data Service will be required to enter into a Licence agreement with CLS (UCL), in addition to the agreements signed with the UKDS. The UKDS will include the 'CLS Licence Agreement for Linked NHS Digital data' in the documentation pack provided to researchers at the point of registration. UCL researchers will need to complete the 'CLS Licence Agreement for Linked NHS Digital data-UCL researchers'.\n\nThe Licensee shall acknowledge in any publication, whether printed, electronic or broadcast, based wholly or in part on such materials, both the source of the data and UCL. An example of an appropriate acknowledgement can be found on the CLS Citing our data webpage.  CLS Hospital Episode Statistics data access update July 2025From March 2027, HES data linked to all four CLS studies will no longer be available via the UK Data Service. For projects ending before March 2027, uses should continue to apply via UKDS. However, if access to a wider range of linked Longitudinal Population Studies data is needed, UKLLC might be more suitable. For projects ending after March 2027, users must apply via UKLLC. Latest edition informationFor the third edition (July 2025), the Consent Linkage data file has been updated to correct nine cases misclassified as 'no data returned'. The user guide has also been updated to reflect these figures.\nThe data cover diverse topics including: diagnosis, maternity, mortality, mental health, types of therapies, lengths of treatment, Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), service providers, organisations, and regional geographical location."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"c:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Millennium Cohort Study: Linked Health Administrative Datasets (Hospital Episode Statistics), England, 2000-2023: Secure Access\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$13\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"Millennium Cohort Study: Linked Health Administrative Datasets (Hospital Episode Statistics), England, 2000-2023: Secure Access\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"$14\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/millennium-cohort-study-linked-health-administrative-datasets-hospital-episode-statistics-england-2000-2023-secure-access\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:site_name\",\"content\":\"Academic Resource Discovery\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:locale\",\"content\":\"en_US\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:image:width\",\"content\":\"1200\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:image:height\",\"content\":\"630\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"og:image:alt\",\"content\":\"Millennium Cohort Study: Linked Health Administrative Datasets (Hospital Episode Statistics), England, 2000-2023: Secure Access\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"website\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary_large_image\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"Millennium Cohort Study: Linked Health Administrative Datasets (Hospital Episode Statistics), England, 2000-2023: Secure Access\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$15\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"17\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]]\na:null\n"])</script></body></html>
