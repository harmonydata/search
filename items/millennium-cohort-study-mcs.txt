The MCS was designed as a multidisciplinary study that could capture the influence of early family context on child development and outcomes throughout childhood, into adolescence and subsequently through adulthood.\n\nToday the MCS covers a diversity of topics including, but not limited to, the cohort members’ health and physical growth, cognitive and socio-emotional development, schooling and leisure, identity and attitudes, relationships and risky behaviours; alongside family context, parenting, and family socio-economic circumstances. It is specially designed to help improve our understanding of smaller groups in the UK — namely those living in disadvantage, ethnic minorities, and families from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nEvidence from the MCS has impacted policy and practice, for example by demonstrating the benefits of breastfeeding on children’s health and cognitive development, the effects of poverty on cognitive development, and contributing to the national evaluation of Sure Start.\n\nStudy website: www.cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/millennium-cohort-study/","url":"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/millennium-cohort-study-mcs","keywords":["Migration and immigration","Social care - need","Work and employment","Language and literacy","Reproductive health","Diet and nutrition","Covid-19 data collection","Education","Sexuality and gender identity","Physical health assessment","Loneliness and social isolation","Neighbourhood","Digital technology and social media","Social care - provision","Housing","Sleep problems","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Political and social attitudes","Ethnicity and race","Puberty","Parenting and family","Victimisation and life events","Cognitive measures","Social care - receipt"],"identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.14301/llcs.v7i4.410","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-018-0506-1","https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyu001","https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyz006","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2008.00219.x","https://doi.org/10.14301/llcs.v7i4.410"],"variableMeasured":[{"name":"bnvist00","description":"S2 NA Visit number"},{"name":"bndowk00","description":"Day of Week","options":["Sat","Monday","Thurs","Sun","Tues","Weds","Fri"]},{"name":"bnctme00","description":"Time of Day","options":["Evening","Afternoon","Morning"]},{"name":"bngcnd00","description":"How would you rate the general condition of most of the residences or other buildings in the street?","options":["Well kept, good repair & exterior surfaces","Fair condition","Badly deteriorated","Poor condition, peeling paint, broken windows"]},{"name":"bnbsec00","description":"Do any of the fronts of residential or commercial units have metal security blinds, gates, or iron bars & grilles?","options":["None","Some","Most"]},{"name":"bntclm00","description":"Are there any traffic calming measures in place on the street?","options":["No","Yes"]},{"name":"bnvtrf00","description":"How would you rate the volume of traffic on the street?","options":["Heavy","Moderate","No traffic permitted","Light"]},{"name":"bnbocr00","description":"Are there any abandoned or burnt-out cars on the street?","options":["No","Yes"]},{"name":"bnlitr00","description":"Is there any of the following: rubbish, litter, broken glass, drug related items, beer cans etc, cigarette ends or discarded packs - in the street or on the pavement?","options":["Yes, just about everywhere you look","None or almost none","Yes, some"]},{"name":"bndfcs00","description":"Is there dog mess on the pavement?","options":["A lot","None","Some"]},{"name":"bngrft00","description":"Is there any graffiti on walls or on public spaces like bus shelters, telephone boxes or notice boards?","options":["A little","A lot","No"]},{"name":"bnvand00","description":"Is there any evidence of vandalism such as broken glass from car windows, bus shelters, telephone boxes?","options":["Yes","No"]},{"name":"bnrwdy00","description":"Are there any adults or teenagers in the street or on the pavements arguing, fighting, drinking, or behaving in any kind of hostile or threatening way?","options":["No-one seen in the street or pavement","Yes, at least one group of three or more","None observed behaving in hostile ways","Yes, one or two arguing etc."]},{"name":"bnsfty00","description":"How did you feel parking, walking, waiting at the door in the street?","options":["I felt afraid for my personal safety","Comfortable - a safe and friendly place","Fairly safe and comfortable","Very comfortable, can imagine living/ shopping here","I would be uncomfortable living/ working/shopping here","I felt like an outsider, looked on suspiciously"]},{"name":"BOPQ1A0","description":"Do you sometimes go to sports classes or sports clubs that are not connected to your school to do sport, gymnastics, swimming, martial arts, horse riding, chess and so on?

A renewed interest in child wellbeing in the late 1990s in the UK led to a new and distinctive child cohort study, after a gap of 30 years. The MCS was designed as a multidisciplinary study that could capture the influence of early family context on child development and outcomes throughout childhood, into adolescence and subsequently through adulthood.

Today the MCS covers a diversity of topics including, but not limited to, the cohort members’ health and physical growth, cognitive and socio-emotional development, schooling and leisure, identity and attitudes, relationships and risky behaviours; alongside family context, parenting, and family socio-economic circumstances. It is specially designed to help improve our understanding of smaller groups in the UK — namely those living in disadvantage, ethnic minorities, and families from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Evidence from the MCS has impacted policy and practice, for example by demonstrating the benefits of breastfeeding on children’s health and cognitive development, the effects of poverty on cognitive development, and contributing to the national evaluation of Sure Start.

Study website: www.cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/millennium-cohort-study/15:T117c,This data collection includes syntax needed to: (1) merge data and commands used for weighting data; (2) derive the sample for analysis 1 (same father-mother households s1-5); (3) derive father involvement (dependent) variables; (4) derive Independent variables; (5) derive mother’s annual pay; (6) derive the relationship breakdown variables for analysis 2. 
All variable manipulations were derived to explore i) paternal involvement in childcare and housework, and ii) the association between paternal involvement in childcare and relationship stability.One of the root causes of persistent gender inequalities in economic and political life is that women carry a heavier workload in the domestic domain where they still do most of the work involved in looking after children and other family members. Women's engagement in employment has risen over the last four decades but men's contribution to childcare and housework has grown more slowly. Sen's (1992) 'capability framework' elaborates how state and organisational policies, social norms, and household economic and demographic circumstances shape men and women's options, decisions and behaviours. This framework suggests there are many social, economic, demographic and cultural factors, which exert logistic pressures on the arrangement of the domestic division of labour in households. Yet the relative importance of these factors in shaping men's involvement in childcare remains under-researched and largely based on small-scale qualitative studies or cross-sectional survey data (Norman 2010; also see O'Brien 2005). 
Our earlier research (Norman 2010; Norman et al 2014; Norman and Elliot 2015) used the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) to develop measures of paternal involvement in childcare when the child was aged nine months and three years old. We found the mothers' employment hours had the strongest association with paternal involvement: if the mother worked full-time both nine months and three years after the child's birth then the father was more likely to be an involved parent when the child was aged three. Fathers were also more likely to be involved when the child was aged three if (i) they worked shorter hours in employment and (ii) if they were involved in childcare nine months after the child's birth; but the effect of both these variables was significantly weaker than that of the mothers' employment hours. 

This research project will build on this analysis, using the MCS, by developing more measures of paternal involvement in childcare to establish which employment and socio-demographic characteristics shape paternal involvement as children age from nine months to eleven years old. Part of the analysis will focus on intact households to remove the confounding impact of relationship breakdown. We will also analyse the relationship between paternal involvement and the probability of households remaining intact given previous research has found a correlation between paternal involvement and the quality of a couple relationship (e.g. Poole et al. 2014).

The research questions to be addressed are:
1. How can we develop measures of paternal involvement over time as the child develops?
2. What are the key employment, socio-demographic, and attitudinal characteristics of fathers in the UK who report involved parenting behaviour when their child is aged 9 months, 3, 5, 7 and 11 years old?
3. Do trajectories of paternal involvement over the child's lifecourse vary between fathers and if so, what are the predictors?
4. Does paternal involvement when the child is aged nine months predict whether a household is still intact when the child reaches age eleven?

In examining these questions, the project aims to contribute to scholarly and policy debates about what encourages or impedes fathers' involvement in providing care for their children. It will make an original contribution to the literature on parental involvement by using a representative sample of fathers to develop measures of paternal involvement, identify differences among fathers and explore how their involvement develops as the child grows older. This is particularly relevant in light of the growing attention to fathers within policy debates about work-family issues across Europe (e.g. European Union 2013), including UK policy, where the introduction of shared parental leave is the most recent reform designed to provide better support for fathers and their involvement in childcare (BIS 2014).16:T1f3b,Background:The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is a large-scale, multi-purpose longitudinal dataset providing information about babies born at the beginning of the 21st century, their progress through life, and the families who are bringing them up, for the four countries of the United Kingdom. The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were:to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born at the start of the 21st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will requireto provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229)to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and developmentto focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may beto emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhoodto investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when availableAdditional objectives subsequently included for MCS were:to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion)to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom, and include disadvantaged areas of EnglandFurther information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies web pages.The content of MCS studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website. The first sweep (MCS1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, the fifth sweep (MCS5) in 2012-2013, when they were eleven years old, the sixth sweep (MCS6) in 2015, when they were fourteen years old, and the seventh sweep (MCS7) in 2018, when they were seventeen years old.End User Licence versions of MCS studies:The End User Licence (EUL) versions of MCS1, MCS2, MCS3, MCS4, MCS5, MCS6 and MCS7 are held under UK Data Archive SNs 4683, 5350, 5795, 6411, 7464, 8156 and 8682 respectively. The longitudinal family file is held under SN 8172.Sub-sample studies:Some studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see EUL SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see EUL SN 5614).Release of Sweeps 1 to 4 to Long Format (Summer 2020)To support longitudinal research and make it easier to compare data from different time points, all data from across all sweeps is now in a consistent format. The update affects the data from sweeps 1 to 4 (from 9 months to 7 years), which are updated from the old/wide to a new/long format to match the format of data of sweeps 5 and 6 (age 11 and 14 sweeps). The old/wide formatted datasets contained one row per family with multiple variables for different respondents. The new/long formatted datasets contain one row per respondent (per parent or per cohort member) for each MCS family. Additional updates have been made to all sweeps to harmonise variable labels and enhance anonymisation.  How to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:For information on how to access biomedical data from MCS that are not held at the UKDS, see the CLS Genetic data and biological samples webpage.Secure Access datasets:Secure Access versions of the MCS have more restrictive access conditions than versions available under the standard End User Licence or Special Licence (see 'Access data' tab above).Secure Access versions of the MCS include:detailed sensitive variables not available under EUL.

MCS Health Visitor Survey:
The dataset is derived from a survey of health visitors undertaken as part of the MCS. The Health Visitor Survey was prepared at the same time as the MCS1 fieldwork, and conducted soon after the MCS1 survey was completed. This time the focus was not on individual MCS participants, but on local services for young families in the MCS electoral wards. It was felt that health visitors might be well placed to provide an expert overview of what was available in the local area, especially given their role in needs assessment. The idea was to provide a snapshot of information about the neighbourhoods in which MCS children would be growing up, so as to help explain health inequalities and ultimately improve the services available to those children. Topics covered include:Childcare available: e.g. local authority/private/employer-provided;Health facilities: e.g. psychologist, speech therapist, physiotherapist;Family support: Family Service Units, National Childbirth Trust etc.;Leisure facilities: open spaces, play areas, pools, sports facilities;Statutory initiatives – Housing (or Education) Action Zone, Sure Start, etc.17:T13dc,The Paternal Involvement and its Effects on Children's Education (PIECE) project explored whether and how fathers' childcare involvement had an association with children's educational attainment at the start of primary school (when children were about age 5), part-way through primary school (when children were about age 7) and at the end of primary school (at age 11). Structural Equation Models were run to explore the relationships between fathers and mothers' involvement, children's cognitive behaviour (measured by the strengths and difficulties questionnaire) and children's attainment in the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile (at age 5) and Key Stage Assessments (at age 7 and 11). (Please note that Age 7 and 11 data is secure from the National Pupil Database so datasets for that modelling have not been deposited here). Findings show how fathers' and mothers' involvement have different effects on a child's education and cognitive behaviour, which suggests that both parents bring something important and different to the child's educational development as they progress through primary school.Fathers spend more time on childcare than ever before (e.g. Fatherhood Institute 2017) but the implications of this on children are unclear. Fathers' childcare involvement should have a positive effect on children's cognitive and educational outcomes (Lamb 2010) but there is little direct evidence to support this. Our study proposes to conduct the first longitudinal analysis in England that explores the relationship between fathers' childcare involvement and their children's attainment at primary school.

Primary education is a pivotal stage of child development because it is the point at which children first make the transition from the home environment to school. Achievements at this early stage can shape educational pathways and thus future employment prospects and opportunities. Previous research with mothers or 'parents' more generally suggests that early parental involvement is critical for child development (e.g. Hsin and Felfe 2014) but we do not know whether fathers impact their children's education differently to mothers, or whether paternal care is particularly important for boys, girls or at certain stages in the child's life regardless of gender. There is an urgent need to explore the potential effect of paternal childcare involvement given the Department for Education (2018) now report that over a quarter of children in England are not primary 'school-ready' because they fall below the expected level for communication and literacy, whilst UNICEF (2018) ranks the UK in the bottom third of 41 of the world's richest countries for inequalities in primary school education. We propose that paternal pre- or school age care could help to support progression in particular academic subjects, close gender gaps in attainment and even moderate the detrimental effects of poverty. 

Using household data from the Millennium Cohort Survey (MCS) linked with official educational records of children from the National Pupil Database (NPD) in England, we will explore whether, how and at what stage fathers' childcare involvement affects children's attainment at primary school. The MCS collects data at four relevant life stages: pre-school (9 months and 3 years), school entry (age 5), in the middle (age 7) and at the end (age 11) of school. Our analysis will track longer, more comprehensive primary school educational trajectories than has been previously possible (e.g. Cano et al. 2019), focussing on how pre-school and school-age paternal childcare involvement affects children's attainment in core (e.g. Maths, English, Science) and non-core (e.g. Art, ICT) subjects at the three key stages of primary school (ages 5, 7 and 11). 

The research questions are:

1. Does paternal involvement increase primary school attainment for children? And specifically:
(a) How important is fathers' pre-school involvement?
(b) Does the sex of the child moderate the effect of paternal involvement on educational attainment?
(c) Does father involvement moderate the known negative effects of poverty?

2. Which kinds of paternal-childcare activities have the strongest effect on a child's primary school attainment, and at what stage of the child's life is this most important? 

The project will make an original contribution to the literature, and contribute to scholarly and policy debates, by being the first UK-based study identifying the ways in which fathers may narrow attainment gaps and/or moderate the known effects of gender and socio-economic status. The findings will be relevant to a range of stakeholders including policymakers, practitioners, teachers and families. Our impact strategy has been developed with the Head of Communications at the Fatherhood Institute (project Co-I) who will draw on existing contacts within the school, early years and health sectors to involve them in a method of coproduction that steers the analysis and turns the results into relevant and impactful resources that are tailored to their specific needs.18:T4bb,Ethnicity Coding for the Millennium Cohort Study, First Survey, 2001-2003 was created as part of an ESRC funded project on ethnic differences in health and development during infancy and early childhood among ethnic groups in the UK. The overall objective of the project was to explore how far ethnic differences in markers of infant and early childhood health and development could be explained by socioeconomic disadvantage.   The study uses ethnicity data from the parent data file of the Millennium Cohort Study: First Survey, 2001-2003 (MCS1) (available from the UKDA under SN 4683).  Users are advised to consult this study for full details of the MCS1 methodology, sampling, and a complete set of documentation.

The pre-existing ethnicity MCS1 variables have been cleaned and recoded.  Particular effort has been made to reclassify cohort members of ‘other’ and ‘mixed’ groups according to data about their parents’ ethnicity. 

Further information about the project is available from the ESRC Award page.
 The study includes 7 and 14 category ethnicity variables for cohort members and their parents. The MCSID (MCS Research Serial Number) is also included for matching to the main MCS1 data.19:Tddf,Promoting cycling, including promoting cycling among children, would be expected to deliver substantial benefits in terms of population health and environmental sustainability. Many children do not meet government recommendations in terms of the amount of exercise they do, and increasing levels of cycling would be one way in which they could incorporate additional physical activity into their everyday lives. In addition, many children are currently driven relatively short distances by their parents to be dropped off at school or other destinations. If more children instead made these trips by bicycle then this would also be expected to reduce the congestion, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions associated with motorised transport. Since 2007, one of the Department for Transport's flagship policies to promote cycling is the delivery of 'Bikeability' cycle proficiency training in schools. Currently, around half of children in England are offered the training for free before they leave primary school, and the annual cost of the programme to the Department for Transport is £11 million. However there exists very little robust evidence regarding which particular children get the cycle training, or regarding the effect the scheme has on subsequent cycling behaviour. In collaboration with the Department for Transport, this proposal will seek to fill these gaps in the evidence using data from the 5th Millennium Cohort Study (MCS). MCS is a nationally-representative birth cohort which has now been surveyed five times, most recently in 2012 at age 10/11. In this most recent sweep, 8,700 parents in England were asked if their children had "ever done any formal cycling proficiency training such as Bikeability". Parents were also asked how often their children used their bicycles. Using these data, we will seek to answer two broad research questions. First we will examine which individual, family and area characteristics help explain why some children do cycle raining and some do not; for example, are boys more likely than girls to get the training, or are children from richer areas more likely to get the training than those from poorer areas? Second, we will examine whether children do in fact cycle more often if they have been offered cycle training in school. Answering this second question will involve comparing children whose schools had already offered cycle training at the time of the MCS survey with children whose schools offered cycle training later in the same year. If cycle training is effective, our prediction is that the first set of children would report cycling more often than the second set of children. As a part of this second research question, we will examine whether there is any evidence that cycle training works better for some sorts of children than for others - for example, whether it has a bigger effect on boys than on girls. Together, answering these two questions will provide the most robust evidence to date regarding the effectiveness of cycle training in schools, and regarding whether all children benefit equally. Our non-academic partners, the Department for Transport, will then be able to use this evidence as part of deciding how best to pursue their goal of increasing cycling in childhood in an effective, cost-effective and equitable manner. Our findings will also have broader relevance for the international evidence base, helping to address the current lack of robust studies examining the effectiveness and equity of different types of policies to promote cycling.1a:T5eb,The Cohort and Longitudinal Studies Enhancement Resources (CLOSER) project aims to maximise the use, value and impact of longitudinal research.

The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were:to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born at the start of the 21st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will requireto provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229)to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and developmentto focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may beto emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhoodto investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when availableAdditional objectives subsequently included for MCS were:to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion)to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom, and include disadvantaged areas of EnglandFurther information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies web pages.The content of MCS studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website. The first sweep (MCS1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, the fifth sweep (MCS5) in 2012-2013, when they were eleven years old, the sixth sweep (MCS6) in 2015, when they were fourteen years old, and the seventh sweep (MCS7) in 2018, when they were seventeen years old.End User Licence versions of MCS studies:The End User Licence (EUL) versions of MCS1, MCS2, MCS3, MCS4, MCS5, MCS6 and MCS7 are held under UK Data Archive SNs 4683, 5350, 5795, 6411, 7464, 8156 and 8682 respectively. The longitudinal family file is held under SN 8172.Sub-sample studies:Some studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see EUL SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see EUL SN 5614).Release of Sweeps 1 to 4 to Long Format (Summer 2020)To support longitudinal research and make it easier to compare data from different time points, all data from across all sweeps is now in a consistent format. The update affects the data from sweeps 1 to 4 (from 9 months to 7 years), which are updated from the old/wide to a new/long format to match the format of data of sweeps 5 and 6 (age 11 and 14 sweeps). The old/wide formatted datasets contained one row per family with multiple variables for different respondents. The new/long formatted datasets contain one row per respondent (per parent or per cohort member) for each MCS family. Additional updates have been made to all sweeps to harmonise variable labels and enhance anonymisation.  How to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:For information on how to access biomedical data from MCS that are not held at the UKDS, see the CLS Genetic data and biological samples webpage.Secure Access datasets:Secure Access versions of the MCS have more restrictive access conditions than versions available under the standard End User Licence or Special Licence (see 'Access data' tab above).Secure Access versions of the MCS include:detailed sensitive variables not available under EUL.

Millennium Cohort Study: Age 7, Sweep 4, 2008: Physical Activity
The MCS4 Physical Activity Data study surveyed levels and patterns of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour (SB) among the MCS cohort. Children who took part in MCS4 (around age 7), were assessed using accelerometers issued to consenting child participants. These measurements were obtained primarily to understand the determinants and consequences of children's PA and SB in the context of the longitudinal biological, social, psychological, behavioural and environmental information collected earlier and to be collected subsequently at MCS home visits. Subsequently, an additional study investigating seasonal variation in levels and patterns of PA and SB was carried out in a sample of MCS children who had participated in the main accelerometer study during winter 2008/09. Repeat accelerometer measurements were obtained from these children during each of the three subsequent seasons during a single calendar year. For further information see the documentation and the main MCS4 survey, held at the UK Data Archive under SN 6411.Latest edition informationFor the third edition (September 2021), the Physical Activity Data User Guide was added to the study. The interviewers invited all children surveyed at age 7 years to wear an accelerometer or ‘activity monitor’. Activity was measured using the Actigraph GT1M uni-axial accelerometer (Actigraph, Pensacola, Florida); a small (38 x 37 x 18 mm) and lightweight (27g) device. The MCS children were asked to start wearing their accelerometer the morning after they received it on their right hip for seven consecutive days during all waking hours, but to remove it during aquatic activities as the accelerometers are not waterproof. Children received either a 26” or 32” sized belt based on their waist size, which was measured at the home interview. Families were asked to complete the timesheet for all days the accelerometer was worn, to cover duration of wear and periods when not worn, as well as whether the week was a ‘typical’ one. Families were asked to return their accelerometer (attached to the belt) and the completed timesheet as soon as possible after the monitoring period. Raw accelerometer readings from each child are also included with the study.1e:T1f86,Background:The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is a large-scale, multi-purpose longitudinal dataset providing information about babies born at the beginning of the 21st century, their progress through life, and the families who are bringing them up, for the four countries of the United Kingdom.

 Participants for the Millennium Cohort Study: Age 9 months, Sweep 1, 2003: Survey of Mothers who Received Assisted Fertility Treatment were drawn from existing MCS respondents. Consenting parents who had reported having any medical infertility treatment for the pregnancy covered by MCS were sent a postal questionnaire which asked more detail about their experiences of infertility treatment. Much of the resulting statistical analysis involved comparing the women who had received different types of infertility treatment, either with each other or with women who had received no such treatment. All analyses allowed for the clustered, stratified sample design, with re-weighting included where necessary to allow for the different sampling proportions.

For the second edition (March 2008), a new version of the data file was deposited, with the family serial number variable (famsrno) replaced by a new serial number variable, mcsid (MCS Research Serial Number). The documentation remains unchanged.

 Topics covered included when and where fertility treatment was sought, the type of treatment received (including drugs prescribed), fertility treatment for previous pregnancies, and costs and overall experience of treatment.1f:T1cd6,Background:The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is a large-scale, multi-purpose longitudinal dataset providing information about babies born at the beginning of the 21st century, their progress through life, and the families who are bringing them up, for the four countries of the United Kingdom.

 Birth Registration and Maternity Hospital Episode Data, 2001-2003:
The health questions included in the main MCS covered topics such as the mother's health during pregnancy, birth and delivery, and the baby's health immediately after birth. However, the time constraints on the MCS interview limited the number of health-related questions included in the questionnaire. Furthermore, mothers may not have been able to recall accurately some of the information on pregnancy and delivery when the nine-month interview was conducted. Mothers responding to the nine-month interview were therefore asked to give written consent to the following records being added to the survey:birth registration records, containing personal and demographic information about baby and parents at birth registrationcentrally collected hospital records: these data contain information about the mother's stay in hospital, including details of any operations performed or any diagnoses that were made during the hospital stay and the length of stay in hospitalCoded hospital of birth data are also included in the dataset (see file hospanon_ns). The corresponding uncoded hospital of birth data are held under SN 5724, but users should note that they are subject to stringent Special Licence Access conditions. For further information on data coverage and record linkage, see documentation.

For the third edition of the study (March 2008), a new version of the data file was deposited, with the family serial number variable (famsrno) replaced by a new serial number variable, mcsid (MCS Research Serial Number). The documentation remains unchanged. For a full edition history, see the study READ file (link below). 

 The data comprise nine files, four covering birth registrations for MCS respondents in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, four covering maternity hospital episodes for the same countries and respondents, and one covering coded hospital of birth data. Data coverage may vary between the countries; see documentation for further details.21:T1d8c,Background:
The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is a large-scale, multi-purpose longitudinal dataset providing information about babies born at the beginning of the 21st century, their progress through life, and the families who are bringing them up, for the four countries of the United Kingdom. The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were:to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born at the start of the 21st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will requireto provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229)to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and developmentto focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may beto emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhoodto investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when availableAdditional objectives subsequently included for MCS were:to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion)to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom, and include disadvantaged areas of EnglandFurther information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies web pages.The content of MCS studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website. The first sweep (MCS1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, the fifth sweep (MCS5) in 2012-2013, when they were eleven years old, the sixth sweep (MCS6) in 2015, when they were fourteen years old, and the seventh sweep (MCS7) in 2018, when they were seventeen years old.
End User Licence versions of MCS studies:The End User Licence (EUL) versions of MCS1, MCS2, MCS3, MCS4, MCS5, MCS6 and MCS7 are held under UK Data Archive SNs 4683, 5350, 5795, 6411, 7464, 8156 and 8682 respectively. The longitudinal family file is held under SN 8172.

Sub-sample studies:
Some studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see EUL SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see EUL SN 5614).Release of Sweeps 1 to 4 to Long Format (Summer 2020)To support longitudinal research and make it easier to compare data from different time points, all data from across all sweeps is now in a consistent format. The update affects the data from sweeps 1 to 4 (from 9 months to 7 years), which are updated from the old/wide to a new/long format to match the format of data of sweeps 5 and 6 (age 11 and 14 sweeps). The old/wide formatted datasets contained one row per family with multiple variables for different respondents. The new/long formatted datasets contain one row per respondent (per parent or per cohort member) for each MCS family. Additional updates have been made to all sweeps to harmonise variable labels and enhance anonymisation.

Millennium Cohort Study: Linkage with the Point of Interest Data
In this particular dataset, the fourth, fifth and sixth sweeps of the MCS data were linked to the Points of Interest (PoI) data to characterise the physical environment around cohort member residences at the moment of the interview. GIS methods were used together with the Ordnance Survey Integrated Transport Network (ITN) data to create buffers around cohort member’s residences. Counts of points of interest, e.g., supermarkets, convenience stores, and others, were created within 400, 800 and 1,600 metres buffers. The categories defined by the PoI data were used to aggregate information, and new categories were derived for specific food outlets.
The PoI dataset contains around 4 million different geographic features. All features are supplied with location, practical information and addresses where possible. It has been available annually from 2005-2013 and quarterly from September 2014, covering all of Great Britain.

The productive surveys of the fourth, fifth and sixth MCS sweeps were linked to the PoI data from Septembers of 2008, 2012 and 2015. PoI data was obtained using an educational licence and mapped using ArcGIS 10.4. Interviews in Northern Ireland were excluded because PoI data is not available. 





The data include number of businesses within 400, 800 and 1,600 meter radii of cohort member's home. Particular interest is paid to fast-food outlets.25:T202f,Background:The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is a large-scale, multi-purpose longitudinal dataset providing information about babies born at the beginning of the 21st century, their progress through life, and the families who are bringing them up, for the four countries of the United Kingdom. The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were:to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born at the start of the 21st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will requireto provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229)to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and developmentto focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may beto emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhoodto investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when availableAdditional objectives subsequently included for MCS were:to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion)to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom, and include disadvantaged areas of EnglandFurther information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies web pages.The content of MCS studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website. The first sweep (MCS1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, the fifth sweep (MCS5) in 2012-2013, when they were eleven years old, the sixth sweep (MCS6) in 2015, when they were fourteen years old, and the seventh sweep (MCS7) in 2018, when they were seventeen years old.End User Licence versions of MCS studies:The End User Licence (EUL) versions of MCS1, MCS2, MCS3, MCS4, MCS5, MCS6 and MCS7 are held under UK Data Archive SNs 4683, 5350, 5795, 6411, 7464, 8156 and 8682 respectively. The longitudinal family file is held under SN 8172.Sub-sample studies:Some studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see EUL SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see EUL SN 5614).Release of Sweeps 1 to 4 to Long Format (Summer 2020)To support longitudinal research and make it easier to compare data from different time points, all data from across all sweeps is now in a consistent format. The update affects the data from sweeps 1 to 4 (from 9 months to 7 years), which are updated from the old/wide to a new/long format to match the format of data of sweeps 5 and 6 (age 11 and 14 sweeps). The old/wide formatted datasets contained one row per family with multiple variables for different respondents. The new/long formatted datasets contain one row per respondent (per parent or per cohort member) for each MCS family. Additional updates have been made to all sweeps to harmonise variable labels and enhance anonymisation.  How to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:For information on how to access biomedical data from MCS that are not held at the UKDS, see the CLS Genetic data and biological samples webpage.Secure Access datasets:Secure Access versions of the MCS have more restrictive access conditions than versions available under the standard End User Licence or Special Licence (see 'Access data' tab above).Secure Access versions of the MCS include:detailed sensitive variables not available under EUL.

The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were:to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born at the start of the 21st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will requireto provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229)to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and developmentto focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may beto emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhoodto investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when availableAdditional objectives subsequently included for MCS were:to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion)to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom, and include disadvantaged areas of EnglandFurther information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies web pages.The content of MCS studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website.The first sweep (MCS1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, the fifth sweep (MCS5) in 2012-2013, when they were eleven years old, the sixth sweep (MCS6) in 2015, when they were fourteen years old, and the seventh sweep (MCS7) in 2018, when they were seventeen years old.End User Licence versions of MCS studies:The End User Licence (EUL) versions of MCS1, MCS2, MCS3, MCS4, MCS5, MCS6 and MCS7 are held under UK Data Archive SNs 4683, 5350, 5795, 6411, 7464, 8156 and 8682 respectively. The longitudinal family file is held under SN 8172.Sub-sample studies:Some studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see EUL SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see EUL SN 5614).Release of Sweeps 1 to 4 to Long Format (Summer 2020)To support longitudinal research and make it easier to compare data from different time points, all data from across all sweeps is now in a consistent format. The update affects the data from sweeps 1 to 4 (from 9 months to 7 years), which are updated from the old/wide to a new/long format to match the format of data of sweeps 5 and 6 (age 11 and 14 sweeps). The old/wide formatted datasets contained one row per family with multiple variables for different respondents. The new/long formatted datasets contain one row per respondent (per parent or per cohort member) for each MCS family. Additional updates have been made to all sweeps to harmonise variable labels and enhance anonymisation.  How to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:For information on how to access biomedical data from MCS that are not held at the UKDS, see the CLS Genetic data and biological samples webpage.Secure Access datasets:Secure Access versions of the MCS have more restrictive access conditions than versions available under the standard End User Licence or Special Licence (see 'Access data' tab above).Secure Access versions of the MCS include:detailed sensitive variables not available under EUL.

The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were:to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born at the start of the 21st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will requireto provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229)to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and developmentto focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may beto emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhoodto investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when availableAdditional objectives subsequently included for MCS were:to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion)to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom, and include disadvantaged areas of EnglandFurther information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies web pages.The content of MCS studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website. The first sweep (MCS1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, the fifth sweep (MCS5) in 2012-2013, when they were eleven years old, the sixth sweep (MCS6) in 2015, when they were fourteen years old, and the seventh sweep (MCS7) in 2018, when they were seventeen years old.
End User Licence versions of MCS studies:The End User Licence (EUL) versions of MCS1, MCS2, MCS3, MCS4, MCS5, MCS6 and MCS7 are held under UK Data Archive SNs 4683, 5350, 5795, 6411, 7464, 8156 and 8682 respectively. The longitudinal family file is held under SN 8172.

Sub-sample studies:
Some studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see EUL SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see EUL SN 5614).Release of Sweeps 1 to 4 to Long Format (Summer 2020)To support longitudinal research and make it easier to compare data from different time points, all data from across all sweeps is now in a consistent format. The update affects the data from sweeps 1 to 4 (from 9 months to 7 years), which are updated from the old/wide to a new/long format to match the format of data of sweeps 5 and 6 (age 11 and 14 sweeps). The old/wide formatted datasets contained one row per family with multiple variables for different respondents. The new/long formatted datasets contain one row per respondent (per parent or per cohort member) for each MCS family. Additional updates have been made to all sweeps to harmonise variable labels and enhance anonymisation.

The MCS Linked Education Administrative Dataset (KS1), Scotland: Secure Access (SN 7414) includes a data file containing selected information from the Pupil Census, 2008, the School Meals Survey and attendance and absence records for the year 2008-2009, for those cohort members attending a school in Scotland at the time of MCS4 interview.  Also included are anonymised Local Education Authorities (LEA) and anonymised School Numbers, to allow comparison of results across LEA and school. The data were obtained only for children whose parents/carers gave consent to data linkage, and who were successfully matched.

This study only includes data for MCS cohort members attending schools in Scotland. Data for England and Wales are available under SNs 8481 and 7415 respectively.

 The Hospital of Birth: Secure Access data cover un-coded hospital of birth for MCS respondents. These data have more restrictive access conditions than those available under the standard End User Licence (see 'Access' section below). Coded hospital of birth data, subject to standard access conditions, are available as part of SN 5614, and users are strongly advised to use those instead. For the fourth edition (December 2022), the data were released under Secure Access licence conditions.

The MCS Longitudinal Family File can be used for research that focuses on a single sweep of MCS or cross-sweep. The file contains the outcomes of MCS families and weights for each sweep released so far. This means that it can be used to follow cases longitudinally. Specific information on how the weight variables have been constructed for each sweep is provided with the User Guide of the respective sweep. The user guide of the MCS longitudinal family file provides guidance on specific variables.

For the fourth edition (September 2020), the data file has been updated to include the weights for the seventh survey (MCS7).
 The MCS longitudinal family file contains one row per family. There is one row for each family that has participated in the Millennium Cohort Study since either Sweep 1 or 2. As there is sample attrition some families may not have participated in certain sweeps, datasets of a specific sweep contain the productive or partially productive cases. However, the MCS longitudinal family file contains one row for each family, including their outcome codes, regardless if they have not participated in later sweeps.30:T1fa3,Background:

 Millennium Cohort Study: Linked Health Administrative Datasets (SAIL), Wales: Secure AccessThe Welsh health data that have been linked to the MCS survey data (UK Data Archive GN 33359) include data files from the SAIL Databank database for those cohort members and their parents/other adult household members with consent to health data linkage obtained at age 7 (and not subsequently withdrawn). The SAIL Databank contains information about all hospital admissions in Wales.At the fourth survey, when the cohort were around 7 years old, adults with parental responsibility were asked to give consent to link information collected within MCS to their child’s routine health records up until their fourteenth birthday. Parents and other adult household respondents were also asked to consent to their own health records being linked.

May 2017: The longitudinal family file is now available separately under

SN 8172.For the fourteenth edition (January 2022), a new data file mcs1_family_interview has been added due to the family level data being split out from the parent-level data to make future merging with MCS8 onwards easier. Two data files (mcs1_parent_interview and mcs1_parent_cm_interview) have been updated to include variables that were missed from the previous edition due to a technical error.  In addition, mcs1_hhgrid has had some data edits applied.Also the following data file specific changes have been made:mcs1_parent_interviewSome variables have been renamed due to duplicates. These are:APLPEV0M (previously APLPEV0A)APLPSM0M (previously APLPSM0A)APLPEY0M (previously APLPEY0A)APLPEM0M (previously APLPEM0A)APLPEV0P (previously APLPEVOO)APLPSM0P (previously APLPSM0B)APLPEY0P (previously APLPEY00)APLPEM0P (previously APLPEM0B)mcs1_hhgridTotal number of cases has changed due to data updates. For sample size please check the longitudinal family file.  December 2024:The family_interview data file has been removed. The family_interview datasets contained some variables that have been moved to Secure Access. The datasets will be replaced at a future redeposit.
 Interviews were conducted with the baby's mother (or other main carer) and father (or other partner of main carer).

The mother or main carer interviews covered ethnicity and language, the baby's father, lone parenthood, pregnancy, labour and delivery, baby's health and development, childcare, grandparents, friends and social support, parental health, education and training, employment and earnings, housing, community and local services, time with and without the baby and other interests. The interview also included a self-completion element covering baby's temperament and behaviour, relationship with partner, previous relationships, domestic tasks, previous pregnancies, mental health, attitudes to relationships, parenting, work, etc.

The father's or main carer's partner interviews covered ethnicity and language, father's involvement with the baby, lone parenthood, baby's mother (if not resident), grandparents and friends, parental health, education and training, employment and earnings, time with and without the baby and other interests. The self-completion element of the father's/main carer's partner interview covered baby's temperament and behaviour, relationship with partner, previous partners, previous children, mental health and attitudes to marriage, parenting and work.

Either parent or carer could answer the household module questions, which covered household composition and relationships, children, employment status, caring responsibilities for the baby born in 2000 and language spoken at home.

MCS5:
The fifth sweep took place when the children were aged around 11 and in their last year of primary school. Fieldwork started in January 2012 and finished in February 2013. Interviews were conducted with the main carer (typically the child’s parent) and their co-resident partner (typically the child’s other parent). The cohort children had measurements taken of their height, weight and body fat; participated in three cognitive assessments and completed a self-completion questionnaire. A survey of class teachers was also conducted but only in England and Wales, and consent was collected from the parent and children to contact the teacher.Latest edition informationFor the 6th edition (October 2022), a new date file mcs5_family_interview, has been added due to the family level data being split out from the parent-level data to make future merging with MCS8 onwards easier. Two data files (mcs5_parent_interview and mcs5_parent_cm_interview) have been updated to include variables that were missed from the previous edition due to a technical error (mainly from the income and employment module). There has been some further restructuring of datasets (parent responses moved out of mcs5_cm_interview and placed into mcs5_parent_cm_interview). Derived SDQ scores have been added to mcs5_cm_derived and a derived Kessler score has been added to mcs5_parent_derived. In addition, the number of cases in the mcs5_hhgrid data file have changed due to updates. Users are advised to check the Longitudinal Family File held under SN 8172 for the sample size.December 2024:The family_interview data file has been removed. The family_interview datasets contained some variables that have been moved to Secure Access. The datasets will be replaced at a future redeposit.



 The files currently included in the MCS5 study comprise data from the main Parent Interview, the Household Grid, Child Measurement and Assessment and the Cohort Member self-completion questionnaire. The Parent Interview file comprises data from the Main Respondent, Partner Respondent and Proxy Respondent questionnaires, which covered household information; family context; education, schooling and childcare; child and family activities; parenting activities; child’s health; parent’s health; employment, income and education; housing and local area; and other matters. The Household Grid file comprises demographic data on households and additional derived variables. The Child Assessments and Measurement files include cognitive and physical measurements, including verbal similarities; a memory task (officially named the Spatial Working Memory task); a decision-making task (officially named the Cambridge Gambling task); height; weight; and waist circumference and body fat measurement. The Cohort Member paper self-completion was given to all participant children. The Teacher Survey data covered information about the child (ability, attitude, behaviour, Special Educational Needs, friends); the child’s parents; streaming and setting, the child’s class; and basic demographics about the teacher.34:T1f50,Background:
The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is a large-scale, multi-purpose longitudinal dataset providing information about babies born at the beginning of the 21st century, their progress through life, and the families who are bringing them up, for the four countries of the United Kingdom. The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were:to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born at the start of the 21st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will requireto provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229)to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and developmentto focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may beto emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhoodto investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when availableAdditional objectives subsequently included for MCS were:to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion)to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom, and include disadvantaged areas of EnglandFurther information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies web pages.The content of MCS studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website. The first sweep (MCS1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, the fifth sweep (MCS5) in 2012-2013, when they were eleven years old, the sixth sweep (MCS6) in 2015, when they were fourteen years old, and the seventh sweep (MCS7) in 2018, when they were seventeen years old.
End User Licence versions of MCS studies:The End User Licence (EUL) versions of MCS1, MCS2, MCS3, MCS4, MCS5, MCS6 and MCS7 are held under UK Data Archive SNs 4683, 5350, 5795, 6411, 7464, 8156 and 8682 respectively. The longitudinal family file is held under SN 8172.

Sub-sample studies:
Some studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see EUL SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see EUL SN 5614).Release of Sweeps 1 to 4 to Long Format (Summer 2020)To support longitudinal research and make it easier to compare data from different time points, all data from across all sweeps is now in a consistent format. The update affects the data from sweeps 1 to 4 (from 9 months to 7 years), which are updated from the old/wide to a new/long format to match the format of data of sweeps 5 and 6 (age 11 and 14 sweeps). The old/wide formatted datasets contained one row per family with multiple variables for different respondents. The new/long formatted datasets contain one row per respondent (per parent or per cohort member) for each MCS family. Additional updates have been made to all sweeps to harmonise variable labels and enhance anonymisation.  

How to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:For information on how to access biomedical data from MCS that are not held at the UKDS, see the CLS Genetic data and biological samples webpage.

Secure Access datasets:
Secure Access versions of the MCS have more restrictive access conditions than versions available under the standard End User Licence or Special Licence (see 'Access data' tab above).

The study covers the Scottish birth record.35:T1f5f,Background:
The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is a large-scale, multi-purpose longitudinal dataset providing information about babies born at the beginning of the 21st century, their progress through life, and the families who are bringing them up, for the four countries of the United Kingdom. The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were:to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born at the start of the 21st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will requireto provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229)to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and developmentto focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may beto emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhoodto investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when availableAdditional objectives subsequently included for MCS were:to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion)to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom, and include disadvantaged areas of EnglandFurther information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies web pages.The content of MCS studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website. The first sweep (MCS1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, the fifth sweep (MCS5) in 2012-2013, when they were eleven years old, the sixth sweep (MCS6) in 2015, when they were fourteen years old, and the seventh sweep (MCS7) in 2018, when they were seventeen years old.
End User Licence versions of MCS studies:The End User Licence (EUL) versions of MCS1, MCS2, MCS3, MCS4, MCS5, MCS6 and MCS7 are held under UK Data Archive SNs 4683, 5350, 5795, 6411, 7464, 8156 and 8682 respectively. The longitudinal family file is held under SN 8172.

Sub-sample studies:
Some studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see EUL SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see EUL SN 5614).Release of Sweeps 1 to 4 to Long Format (Summer 2020)To support longitudinal research and make it easier to compare data from different time points, all data from across all sweeps is now in a consistent format. The update affects the data from sweeps 1 to 4 (from 9 months to 7 years), which are updated from the old/wide to a new/long format to match the format of data of sweeps 5 and 6 (age 11 and 14 sweeps). The old/wide formatted datasets contained one row per family with multiple variables for different respondents. The new/long formatted datasets contain one row per respondent (per parent or per cohort member) for each MCS family. Additional updates have been made to all sweeps to harmonise variable labels and enhance anonymisation.

The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were:to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born at the start of the 21st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will requireto provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229)to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and developmentto focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may beto emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhoodto investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when availableAdditional objectives subsequently included for MCS were:to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion)to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom, and include disadvantaged areas of EnglandFurther information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies web pages.The content of MCS studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website.The first sweep (MCS1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, the fifth sweep (MCS5) in 2012-2013, when they were eleven years old, the sixth sweep (MCS6) in 2015, when they were fourteen years old, and the seventh sweep (MCS7) in 2018, when they were seventeen years old.End User Licence versions of MCS studies:The End User Licence (EUL) versions of MCS1, MCS2, MCS3, MCS4, MCS5, MCS6 and MCS7 are held under UK Data Archive SNs 4683, 5350, 5795, 6411, 7464, 8156 and 8682 respectively.

Millennium Cohort Study: Linked Education Administrative Datasets (KS1-KS4), Wales: Secure AccessThese datasets include education administrative records for Wales up to age 16 to survey data for cohort members in the MCS. The main aim of this data linkage exercise is to enhance the research potential of the study, by combining administrative education records with the rich information collected in the surveys. 
Datasets include anonymised Local Education Authorities (LEA) to allow comparison of results across LEA. The data were obtained only for children whose parents/carers gave consent to data linkage, and who were successfully matched.
The following linked data are available: Pupil level school census dataKS1, KS2 and KS3 results, Welsh Examinations database KS4 results and teaching assessment dataAbsence and exclusions dataSpecial educational needs and educated other than at school data3d:T29e3,Background:
The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is a large-scale, multi-purpose longitudinal dataset providing information about babies born at the beginning of the 21st century, their progress through life, and the families who are bringing them up, for the four countries of the United Kingdom. The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were:to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born at the start of the 21st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will requireto provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229)to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and developmentto focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may beto emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhoodto investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when availableAdditional objectives subsequently included for MCS were:to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion)to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom, and include disadvantaged areas of EnglandFurther information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies web pages.The content of MCS studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website. The first sweep (MCS1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, the fifth sweep (MCS5) in 2012-2013, when they were eleven years old, the sixth sweep (MCS6) in 2015, when they were fourteen years old, and the seventh sweep (MCS7) in 2018, when they were seventeen years old.
End User Licence versions of MCS studies:The End User Licence (EUL) versions of MCS1, MCS2, MCS3, MCS4, MCS5, MCS6 and MCS7 are held under UK Data Archive SNs 4683, 5350, 5795, 6411, 7464, 8156 and 8682 respectively. The longitudinal family file is held under SN 8172.

Sub-sample studies:
Some studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see EUL SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see EUL SN 5614).Release of Sweeps 1 to 4 to Long Format (Summer 2020)To support longitudinal research and make it easier to compare data from different time points, all data from across all sweeps is now in a consistent format. The update affects the data from sweeps 1 to 4 (from 9 months to 7 years), which are updated from the old/wide to a new/long format to match the format of data of sweeps 5 and 6 (age 11 and 14 sweeps). The old/wide formatted datasets contained one row per family with multiple variables for different respondents. The new/long formatted datasets contain one row per respondent (per parent or per cohort member) for each MCS family. Additional updates have been made to all sweeps to harmonise variable labels and enhance anonymisation.

CLS/ NHS Digital Sub-licence agreement
NHS Digital has given CLS permission for onward sharing of the MCS/HES dataset via the UKDS Secure Lab. In order to ensure data minimisation, NHS Digital require that researchers only access the HES variables needed for their approved research project. Therefore, the HES linked data provided by the UKDS to approved researchers will be subject to sub-setting of variables. The researcher will need to request a specific sub-set of variables from the MCS HES data dictionary, which will subsequently be made available within their UKDS Secure Account. Once the researcher has finished their research, the UKDS will delete the tailored dataset for that specific project.

Any party wishing to access the data deposited at the UK Data Service will be required to enter into a Licence agreement with CLS (UCL), in addition to the agreements signed with the UKDS. The UKDS will include the 'CLS Licence Agreement for Linked NHS Digital data' in the documentation pack provided to researchers at the point of registration. UCL researchers will need to complete the 'CLS Licence Agreement for Linked NHS Digital data-UCL researchers'.

The Licensee shall acknowledge in any publication, whether printed, electronic or broadcast, based wholly or in part on such materials, both the source of the data and UCL. An example of an appropriate acknowledgement can be found on the CLS Citing our data webpage.  CLS Hospital Episode Statistics data access update July 2025From March 2027, HES data linked to all four CLS studies will no longer be available via the UK Data Service. For projects ending before March 2027, uses should continue to apply via UKDS. However, if access to a wider range of linked Longitudinal Population Studies data is needed, UKLLC might be more suitable. For projects ending after March 2027, users must apply via UKLLC. Latest edition informationFor the third edition (July 2025), the Consent Linkage data file has been updated to correct nine cases misclassified as 'no data returned'. The user guide has also been updated to reflect these figures.
The data cover diverse topics including: diagnosis, maternity, mortality, mental health, types of therapies, lengths of treatment, Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), service providers, organisations, and regional geographical location.3e:T21d1,Background:

Initiated in response to a renewed focus on child wellbeing in the UK during the late 1990s, the MCS aims to explore the impact of early family environments on children's development and outcomes throughout their lives. This multidisciplinary study covers a wide range of topics, including health, physical growth, cognitive and socio-emotional development, education, leisure activities, identity, attitudes, relationships, and risky behaviors. It also examines family context, parenting, and socio-economic conditions.

The MCS is particularly valuable for understanding the experiences of smaller demographic groups in the UK, such as disadvantaged populations, ethnic minorities, and families in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The findings from the MCS have influenced policy and practice, highlighting the benefits of breastfeeding, the impact of poverty on cognitive development, and contributing to evaluations of programs like Sure Start. The study's comprehensive data collection and analysis provide critical insights into the factors that shape children's lives and inform efforts to improve child wellbeing across the UK.a:[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$12"}}],["$","$L13",null,{"dataset":{"title":"Millennium Cohort Study (MCS)","description":"$14","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/MCS.png","publisher":{"name":"Centre for Longitudinal Studies, UCL Institute of Education","url":"$undefined","logo":"$undefined"},"funders":[{"name":"Economic and Social Research Council","url":"$undefined","logo":"$undefined"},{"name":"Consortium of UK Government Departments","url":"$undefined","logo":"$undefined"},{"name":"ESRC DfE DoHSC DfWP DfT HOUK MoJ NIE Scot Welsh ONS Wellcome DHHS NIH\nSir Siegmund Warburg Voluntary Settlement\nInternational Centre for Child Studies","url":"$undefined","logo":"$undefined"}],"geographicCoverage":"GB","temporalCoverage":"$undefined","ageCoverage":"$undefined","studyDesign":[],"resourceType":"study","topics":["Migration and immigration","Social care -

40:T550,The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) follows the lives of around 19,000 children born in the UK in September 2000 - January 2002.

A renewed interest in child wellbeing in the late 1990s in the UK led to a new and distinctive child cohort study, after a gap of 30 years. The MCS was designed as a multidisciplinary study that could capture the influence of early family context on child development and outcomes throughout childhood, into adolescence and subsequently through adulthood.

Today the MCS covers a diversity of topics including, but not limited to, the cohort members’ health and physical growth, cognitive and socio-emotional development, schooling and leisure, identity and attitudes, relationships and risky behaviours; alongside family context, parenting, and family socio-economic circumstances. It is specially designed to help improve our understanding of smaller groups in the UK — namely those living in disadvantage, ethnic minorities, and families from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Evidence from the MCS has impacted policy and practice, for example by demonstrating the benefits of breastfeeding on children’s health and cognitive development, the effects of poverty on cognitive development, and contributing to the national evaluation of Sure Start.
