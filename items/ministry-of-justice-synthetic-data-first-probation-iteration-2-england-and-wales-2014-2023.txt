This aims to improve on links already made within probation services. This opens up the potential to better understand probation service users and address questions on, for example, what works to reduce reoffending. The Ministry of Justice Data First linking dataset can be used in combination with this and other Data First datasets to join up administrative records about people from across justice services (courts, prisons and probation) to increase understanding around users' interactions, pathways and outcomes.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Ministry of Justice Synthetic Data First Probation Iteration 2, England and Wales, 2014-2023"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Ministry of Justice Synthetic Data First Probation Iteration 2, England and Wales, 2014-2023"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/ministry-of-justice-synthetic-data-first-probation-iteration-2-england-and-wales-2014-2023"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Ministry of Justice Synthetic Data First Probation Iteration 2, England and Wales, 2014-2023"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Ministry of Justice Synthetic Data First Probation Iteration 2, England and Wales, 2014-2023"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
