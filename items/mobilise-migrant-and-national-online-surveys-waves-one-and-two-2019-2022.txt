Waves One and Two, 2019-2022","description":"The MOBILISE project examines why some people respond to discontent by protesting, others by migrating while yet others stay immobile. It focuses on four countries that have seen outmigration and protest in recent year (Ukraine, Poland, Morocco and Argentina) and migrants from these countries who live in Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain. The main body of MOBILISE survey data are nationally representative face-to-face surveys in Ukraine, Poland, Morocco and Argentina. As these surveys are unable to capture (current) migrants from these countries – a group that is crucial to answering the MOBILISE research question – MOBILISE employs a migrant survey targeted at three destination countries; Germany, the UK and Spain. MOBILISE migrant surveys were closely oriented to the national surveys in order to achieve the longitudinal nature of the data. All of the surveys thoroughly ask for political views and beliefs as well as socio economic background, the reasons and motivations to (or not) migrate and the reason to (or not) protest. The migrant survey was run online. We also ran two supplementary online national surveys targeting the general population in Ukraine and Argentina. All MOBILISE national and migrant surveys are set-up as a two wave panel. The first wave of data collection for the migrant and national survey started in September 2019 and finished in March 2020.  The second wave started between December 2020 and December 2021. This data deposit contains wave one and two of the migrant and national online surveys (the nationally representative surveys are deposited separately).The MOBILISE project asks: When there is discontent, why do some people protest while others cross borders? Connecting theoretical expectations from the migration and protest literatures, we examine: a) whether similar factors drive the choice to migrate and/or protest at the individual level; b) how context affects this mobilisation; c) whether these choices are independent of each other or mutually reinforcing/ undermining. MOBILISE employs a multi-method (nationally representative face-to-face panel surveys, online migrant surveys, protest participant surveys, focus groups, life-history interviews, social media analysis) and a multi-sited research design. It covers Ukraine, Poland, Morocco and Brazil, which have recently witnessed large-scale emigration and protests. It follows migrants from these countries to Germany, the UK and Spain. The project offers four key innovations: 1)it combines protest and migration; 2)it captures all the relevant groups for a comparative study (protesters, migrants, migrant protesters and people who have not engaged in migration or protest); 3)it tracks individuals over time by employing a panel survey; 4)it includes the use of social media data providing real time information on the role of networks and political remittances. These features allow the project to make a major contribution to theory development in both migration and protest studies and offer key insights to policy makers on factors influencing political and economic stability.","url":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/mobilise-migrant-and-national-online-surveys-waves-one-and-two-2019-2022","identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-856667"],"keywords":["INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION","LABOUR MIGRATION","DETERMINANTS OF MOBILIZATION","DETERMINANTS OF PROTEST","FACTORS DRIVING MIGRATION","FACTORS DRIVING PROTEST","POLITICAL DISCONTENT"],"temporalCoverage":"2019-09-01/2022-01-22"}15:Tc29,The MOBILISE project examines why some people respond to discontent by protesting, others by migrating while yet others stay immobile.
