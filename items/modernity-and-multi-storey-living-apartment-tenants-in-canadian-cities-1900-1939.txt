c) a small sample of residents of <i>houses</i> situated close to major concentrations of apartment buildings.

Data were collected for three sample years: 1909, when only 9 of the selected buildings in Toronto, and 8 in Winnipeg, had been erected; 1914, by which date 29 of the selected Toronto buildings, and 32 in Winnipeg, had been completed; and 1930, when the full sample of 72 buildings in Toronto and 60 in Winnipeg were occupied.

The databases each include a table of 'building information' recording ownership and other information pertaining to the sample buildings over the whole period, 1900-1939; a photo album of illustrations of sample buildings; three tables listing the occupiers of all apartment suites in the sample buildings in 1909, 1914 and 1930; and a table listing occupants of 'nearby houses' over the whole period.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Modernity and Multi-Storey Living : Apartment Tenants in Canadian Cities, 1900-1939"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Modernity and Multi-Storey Living : Apartment Tenants in Canadian Cities, 1900-1939"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/modernity-and-multi-storey-living-apartment-tenants-in-canadian-cities-1900-1939"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Modernity and Multi-Storey Living : Apartment Tenants in Canadian Cities, 1900-1939"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Modernity and Multi-Storey Living : Apartment Tenants in Canadian Cities, 1900-1939"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
