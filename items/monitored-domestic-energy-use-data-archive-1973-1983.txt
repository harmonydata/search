It is intended that other datasets will be added to the <i>Archive</i> in the future both from the Better Insulated Housing programme and from other sources. There are several directions in which the <i>Archive</i> might usefully be expanded. In particular it would be helpful to add datasets on non-public sector housing.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Monitored Domestic Energy Use Data Archive, 1973-1983"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Monitored Domestic Energy Use Data Archive, 1973-1983"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/monitored-domestic-energy-use-data-archive-1973-1983"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Monitored Domestic Energy Use Data Archive, 1973-1983"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Monitored Domestic Energy Use Data Archive, 1973-1983"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
