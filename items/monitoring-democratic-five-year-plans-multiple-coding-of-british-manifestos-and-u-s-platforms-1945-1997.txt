  The datasets included in this study represent proportions of coded text of all standard British general election manifestos for the Conservative, Labour and Liberal/Liberal-SDP Alliance/Liberal Democratic parties from 1945 to1997 (apart from specific editions of the manifestos published for use in a specific region or specific interests), and all American Presidential platforms for the Democratic and Republican parties from 1948-1996.
In the case of each country, specific datasets (or subsets) have been created according to seven distinct coding schemes as follows: pledges, policy domains, policy salience, public opinion, values and attitudes, computer derived policy coding frame, and computerised policy salience.
