During their childhood, the main aim of the NSHD was to investigate how the environment at home and at school affected physical and mental development and educational attainment. During adulthood, the main aim was to investigate how childhood health and development and lifetime social circumstances affected their adult health and function and how these change with age. Today, with study members in their seventies, the NSHD offers a unique opportunity to explore the long-term biological and social processes of ageing and how ageing is affected by factors acting across the whole of life.","url":"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/mrc-national-survey-of-health-and-development-nshd","keywords":["Covid-19 data collection","Biomarkers","Cognitive

Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) is a pioneering longitudinal study that has tracked the lives of 5,362 individuals born in England, Scotland, and Wales during one week in March 1946. As the oldest continuously studied birth cohort in the UK, the NSHD provides invaluable insights into the impact of early life conditions on later health and development. Initially, the study focused on understanding how home and school environments influenced physical and mental development and educational outcomes during childhood. As participants transitioned into adulthood, the research expanded to examine how early health and social circumstances influenced adult health, functionality, and the ageing process. Now, with participants in their seventies, the NSHD continues to offer a unique perspective on the biological and social determinants of ageing, contributing significantly to our understanding of how life-long factors affect health and wellbeing in later life. The study's comprehensive data collection over decades makes it a critical resource for researchers studying the interplay between life course factors and ageing.a:[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$12"}}],["$","$L13",null,{"dataset":{"title":"MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD)","description":"The MRC National Survey of Health and Development is the oldest and longest running continually-studied British birth cohort study, having followed a sample of 5,362 men and women born in England, Scotland and Wales since their birth in one week in March, 1946.

During adulthood, the main aim was to investigate how childhood health and development and lifetime social circumstances affected their adult health and function and how these change with age. Today, with study members in their seventies, the NSHD offers a unique opportunity to explore the long-term biological and social processes of ageing and how ageing is affected by factors acting
