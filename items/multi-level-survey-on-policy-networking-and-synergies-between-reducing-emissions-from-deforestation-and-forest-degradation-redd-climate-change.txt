    How can existing political constraints to such integration be overcome and existing opportunities for integration be realised?

In investigating multi-level governance processes, this research contributes to the knowledge on multi-level forest governance as well as on climate change mitigation and adaptation. In examining the governance constraints and opportunities for integration, it aims to inform ongoing global and national policy processes about how to improve effectiveness of policy formulation and implementation in order to deliver more effective carbon emission reductions while enhancing adaptive capacity of forest dependent communities.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Multi-level survey on policy networking and synergies between Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation in Brazil and Indonesia"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Multi-level survey on policy networking and synergies between Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation in Brazil and Indonesia"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/multi-level-survey-on-policy-networking-and-synergies-between-reducing-emissions-from-deforestation-and-forest-degradation-redd-climate-change"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Multi-level survey on policy networking and synergies between Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation in Brazil and Indonesia"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Multi-level survey on policy networking and synergies between Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation in Brazil and Indonesia"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
