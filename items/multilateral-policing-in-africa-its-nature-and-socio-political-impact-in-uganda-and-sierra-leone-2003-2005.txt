This data collection includes extracts from interviews with key stakeholders, including those who authorise policing, those who provide it and those who use it.

A later qualitative study by the same principal investigator, Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Police Local Partnership Boards in Sierra Leone, 2006, is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 5751. Further information about these studies and other research projects on African policing may be found on the principal investigator's Welcome to African Policing web site.

 The topics covered in the interviews are concerned with policing, its nature and provision, and the use of policing made by different groups and individuals interviewed. Users should note that the transcripts are extracts, not full interviews, and in some cases are very brief.
