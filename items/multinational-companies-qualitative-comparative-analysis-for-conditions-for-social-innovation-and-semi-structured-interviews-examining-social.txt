Defined as the “innovative activities and services that are motivated by the goal of meeting a social need” (Mulgan, 2006, p. 146), particularly those arising from social divides within society and the corporate responsibilities towards the externalities that MNCs create, we considered when and how some actors within MNCs engage in innovative activities that address such social divides, with a view to understanding whether and how such initiatives contribute to inclusive growth and to sustainable development. Our primary focus is on the process of social innovation that pertains to inequality in general and the work of ‘social activists’ from both inside and beyond the boundaries of these companies. We studied social innovation as a combination of not only top-down initiatives led by executives and those close to them, but also bottom-up processes led by social activists from a range of backgrounds and positions. We sought to understand the dynamics of such social innovations as regards which actors are taking them forward, what these initiatives concern, what resources are deployed, how such initiatives span the boundaries of companies and civil societies, and whether and why they are successful. We addressed the opportunities and challenges for the scaling up of social innovations through MNCs’ transnational networks, which are a key driver of transformations in both developed and emerging economies on both sides of the Atlantic. The research was envisaged to last 30 months. One of the consequences of the pandemic was that initial access in early 2020 was challenging and we sought an extension to 36 months. Hence the project began in early 2020 and ran up till the end of 2022.\nThere were two phases to the project.

Phase 2 consisted of semi-structured interviews examine four research question related to social innovation i) interests and motivations of social innovation ii) skills and resources of social innovation iii) inhibiting and enabling institutional factors of social innovation iv) outcomes of social innovation.This project is about social innovation carried out by multinational companies to address inequality. With their cross-border mobilisation of technologies and relentless search for skills, markets and cost savings, multinationals can be drivers of inequality.

These initiatives may concern healthcare, educational and skill ecosystems, core labour rights, discrimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation and disability, or the marginalisation of migrants and indigenous peoples.\n\nThis project looks at social innovation initiatives on inequality carried out by actors within multinational companies in interaction with civil society and government stakeholders in different industry, community and national contexts.

We studied social innovation as a combination of not only top-down initiatives led by executives and those close to them, but also bottom-up processes led by social activists from a range of backgrounds and positions. We sought to understand the dynamics of such social innovations as regards which actors are taking them forward, what these initiatives concern, what resources are deployed, how such initiatives span the boundaries of companies and civil societies, and whether and why they are successful. We addressed the opportunities and challenges for the scaling up of social innovations through MNCs’ transnational networks, which are a key driver of transformations in both developed and emerging economies on both sides of the Atlantic. The research was envisaged to last 30 months. One of the consequences of the pandemic was that initial access in early 2020 was challenging and we sought an extension to 36 months. Hence the project began in early 2020 and ran up till the end of 2022.
There were two phases to the project. Phase one entailed a Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QAC) to analyse conditions of 10 cases of social innovation in and around MNCs. Phase 2 consisted of semi-structured interviews examine four research question related to social innovation i) interests and motivations of social innovation ii) skills and resources of social innovation iii) inhibiting and enabling institutional factors of social innovation iv) outcomes of social innovation.This project is about social innovation carried out by multinational companies to address inequality. With their cross-border mobilisation of technologies and relentless search for skills, markets and cost savings, multinationals can be drivers of inequality. Yet, some countervailing evidence points to some multinationals engaging in initiatives to address economic and social issues. These initiatives may concern healthcare, educational and skill ecosystems, core labour rights, discrimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation and disability, or the marginalisation of migrants and indigenous peoples.

This project looks at social innovation initiatives on inequality carried out by actors within multinational companies in interaction with civil society and government stakeholders in different industry, community and national contexts. It focuses on three developed economies (Canada, Netherlands, United Kingdom) and two emerging economies (Brazil, Mexico). The multidisciplinary research team in these countries will look at the nature of these innovations and whether, and how they are scaled-up and diffused beyond the boundaries of national institutional systems to address broader concerns. 

The project aims to understand the different types of social activists who instigate, spread and sustain such social innovations, the resources and social skills they deploy, and the level of social reach and impact they attain. 

In adopting a lens to look at social innovation initiatives as bottom-up and co-constructed by a variety of private-firm and community actors, with a focus on the conditions under which such innovations might be scaled up to provide broader solutions to problems of inequality and inclusive growth, this project will enable policymakers, multinational managers and community activists to develop policy recommendations to promote diversity and social inclusion and will highlight the conditions and practises conducive to the scaling-up and dissemination of social innovation initiatives on inequality.1f:["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:description","content":"$2e"}]

2f:T114b,This project analysed social innovations relating to inequality that are carried out by social activists in and around multinational companies (MNCs) in five national contexts. Defined as the “innovative activities and services that are motivated by the goal of meeting a social need” (Mulgan, 2006, p. 146), particularly those arising from social divides within society and the corporate responsibilities towards the externalities that MNCs create, we considered when and how some actors within MNCs engage in innovative activities that address such social divides, with a view to understanding whether and how such initiatives contribute to inclusive growth and to sustainable development. Our primary focus is on the process of social innovation that pertains to inequality in general and the work of ‘social activists’ from both inside and beyond the boundaries of these companies. We studied social innovation as a combination of not only top-down initiatives led by executives and those close to them, but also bottom-up processes led by social activists from a range of backgrounds and positions. We sought to understand the dynamics of such social innovations as regards which actors are taking them forward, what these initiatives concern, what resources are deployed, how such initiatives span the boundaries of companies and civil societies, and whether and why they are successful. We addressed the opportunities and challenges for the scaling up of social innovations through MNCs’ transnational networks, which are a key driver of transformations in both developed and emerging economies on both sides of the Atlantic.
