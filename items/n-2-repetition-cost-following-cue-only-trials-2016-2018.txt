The index finger of the dominant hand rested on a central button between responses and moved to press the button to the left or right depending on which task had been cued and which target stimulus had been shown.  The cue word \"COLOUR\" indicated that the colour of the shape should be responded to (blue and green with a leftward response; red and yellow for rightward response); the word \"SHAPE\" for the shape itself (square and triangle with a leftward response; circle and diamond with a rightward response); and the word \"LINE\" for the orientation of the line (slanted left and vertical with a leftward response; slanted right and horizontal with a rightward response).  There were two types of trial.  On \"completed\" trials, the task was performed as well as prepared:  following cue-presentation, cue words were replaced by a target stimulus until a response was made.  On \"cue-only\" trials, the trial could only be prepared but not performed:  following cue-presentation, the cue simply disappeared with no target stimulus being shown.

The n - 2 repetition cost has been proposed to index the effect of persisting inhibition of a recently switched-from task, or \"backward inhibition\".
