2010-2015 surveys temporarily withdrawn
The data for the 2010-2014 surveys were temporarily withdrawn at the request of the depositor in October 2015. The 2015 data (SN 8163 and the Special Licence version, SN 8164)  were temporarily withdrawn at the request of the depositor in February 2020.
 The 2011-2012 survey included all adult patients who were treated for cancer between 1 September and 30 November 2011 in NHS Trusts across England. Patients were placed into one of 13 cancer groups using their ICD10 code (cancer diagnosis code). The survey covered both inpatients and day case patients.

 A small number of changes were made to the content of the survey in 2011-2012, to remove or reword some questions and to introduce new questions. These covered: patients' views being taken into account by doctors and nurses when discussing treatment; patients being asked to participate in cancer research; patients being able to discuss worries and fears with staff; patients being offered a written assessment and care plan; and on their overall rating of care received.1d:["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:description","content":"$2c"}]

2d:Tc35,The National Cancer Patient Experience Surveys (NCPES) began in 2010, after the 2007 'Cancer Reform Strategy' set out a commitment to establish a new survey programme. The NCPES is intended to be a vehicle enabling and supporting quality improvement in the NHS and has been used by national bodies, NHS Hospitals, specialist cancer teams, and national and condition specific charities to improve services for patients. It is designed to monitor national progress on cancer care and to help gather vital information on the Transforming Inpatient Care Programme, the National Cancer Survivorship Initiative and the National Cancer Equality Initiative. An Advisory Group was set up for the NCPES with the National Cancer Director, professionals, voluntary sector representatives, academics and patient survey experts. The Group agreed on the following guiding principles and objectives:a standard national survey tool was to be usedsurveys would be conducted at Trust level and identify cancer groupsthe survey would cover all cancers and include the whole care pathwaythe survey should use the word 'cancer' unlike the 2000 and 2004 surveysthe survey focus would be on patients (rather than carers)the data would be used for benchmarking performance across Trusts and by cancer groups where numbers allowthe data would be used to inform national and local policythe data would be made publicly available whilst observing patient data protection requirements and maintaining confidentiality.
The survey is intended to be a vehicle enabling and supporting quality improvement in the NHS and has been used by national bodies, NHS Hospitals, specialist cancer teams, and national and condition specific charities to improve services for patients. 

The NCPES has been replicated in Wales (see SN 7510), Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, parts of Australia, and the Middle East.
