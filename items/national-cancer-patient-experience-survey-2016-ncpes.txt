to provide NHS Improving Quality with data on each participating trust and the areas on which quality improvement needs to be focused and
to enable patients to make informed choices about where to go for cancer treatment via publishing the provider level analysis on publicly available websites.

A more detailed version of the 2016 data, held under SN 8363, is available under restrictive Special Licence Access conditions. This contains hospital of treatment, geographic information and more detailed demographic information. 
 The survey asked all cancer patients about their experiences of the NHS cancer pathway; from diagnosis through to treatment through to aftercare, as well as some questions about protected characteristics.19:T127c,The National Cancer Patient Experience Surveys (NCPES) began in 2010, after the 2007 'Cancer Reform Strategy' set out a commitment to establish a new survey programme. The NCPES is intended to be a vehicle enabling and supporting quality improvement in the NHS and has been used by national bodies, NHS Hospitals, specialist cancer teams, and national and condition specific charities to improve services for patients. It is designed to monitor national progress on cancer care and to help gather vital information on the Transforming Inpatient Care Programme, the National Cancer Survivorship Initiative and the National Cancer Equality Initiative. An Advisory Group was set up for the NCPES with the National Cancer Director, professionals, voluntary sector representatives, academics and patient survey experts. The Group agreed on the following guiding principles and objectives:a standard national survey tool was to be usedsurveys would be conducted at Trust level and identify cancer groupsthe survey would cover all cancers and include the whole care pathwaythe survey should use the word 'cancer' unlike the 2000 and 2004 surveysthe survey focus would be on patients (rather than carers)the data would be used for benchmarking performance across Trusts and by cancer groups where numbers allowthe data would be used to inform national and local policythe data would be made publicly available whilst observing patient data protection requirements and maintaining confidentiality.
The survey is intended to be a vehicle enabling and supporting quality improvement in the NHS and has been used by national bodies, NHS Hospitals, specialist cancer teams, and national and condition specific charities to improve services for patients. 

The NCPES has been replicated in Wales (see SN 7510), Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, parts of Australia, and the Middle East.

2010-2015 surveys temporarily withdrawn
The data for the 2010-2014 surveys were temporarily withdrawn at the request of the depositor in October 2015. The 2015 data (SN 8163 and the Special Licence version, SN 8164)  were temporarily withdrawn at the request of the depositor in February 2020.
 2016 survey:The purposes of the Cancer Patient Experience Survey 2016 were: 
to secure continuous improvement by building on the results of the 2015 survey and to enable local providers to assess their performance improvement with other providers;
to enable commissioners to assess local improvements in cancer patient experience via locally agreed Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) schemes; 
to provide NHS England with an up to date overview of cancer patient experience across England; 
to provide NHS Improving Quality with data on each participating trust and the areas on which quality improvement needs to be focused and
to enable patients to make informed choices about where to go for cancer treatment via publishing the provider level analysis on publicly available websites.
The data is based on the experience of an initial sample of 118,253 cancer patients, reduced to 109,663 through checking and deceased status measures, and in total 72,788 responded, either by post or online, phone or through the Quality Health translation service. The response rate was 66.4% overall, in line with the levels attained in previous years. The CPES is intended to be a vehicle enabling and supporting quality improvement in the NHS and has been used by national bodies, NHS Hospitals, specialist cancer teams, and national and condition-specific charities to improve services for patients.
This study, SN 8362, is an edited version of the data collection, subject to standard End User Licence access conditions. NHS England has devised a set of rules to be applied to the data and edited the dataset in order to suppress any personally identifiable information in accordance with the ICO's guidelines on anonymisation and the National Statistician's guidance on suppressing disclosive data. These rules are designed such that there will be no less than three respondents shown when any given cross-tabulation is applied to the data.
