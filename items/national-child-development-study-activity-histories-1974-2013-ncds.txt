17:T1cde,{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"National Child Development Study: Activity Histories, 1974-2013 / NCDS","description":"The National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a continuing longitudinal study that seeks to follow the lives of all those living in Great Britain who were born in one particular week in 1958. The aim of the study is to improve understanding of the factors affecting human development over the whole lifespan. The NCDS has its origins in the Perinatal Mortality Survey (PMS) (the original PMS study is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 2137). This study was sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund and designed to examine the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy among the 17,000 children born in England, Scotland and Wales in that one week. Selected data from the PMS form NCDS sweep 0, held alongside NCDS sweeps 1-3, under SN 5565. Survey and Biomeasures Data (GN 33004):To date there have been nine attempts to trace all members of the birth cohort in order to monitor their physical, educational and social development. The first three sweeps were carried out by the National Children's Bureau, in 1965, when respondents were aged 7, in 1969, aged 11, and in 1974, aged 16 (these sweeps form NCDS1-3, held together with NCDS0 under SN 5565). The fourth sweep, also carried out by the National Children's Bureau, was conducted in 1981, when respondents were aged 23 (held under SN 5566). In 1985 the NCDS moved to the Social Statistics Research Unit (SSRU) - now known as the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS). The fifth sweep was carried out in 1991, when respondents were aged 33 (held under SN 5567). For the sixth sweep, conducted in 1999-2000, when respondents were aged 42 (NCDS6, held under SN 5578), fieldwork was combined with the 1999-2000 wave of the 1970 Birth Cohort Study (BCS70), which was also conducted by CLS (and held under GN 33229). The seventh sweep was conducted in 2004-2005 when the respondents were aged 46 (held under SN 5579), the eighth sweep was conducted in 2008-2009 when respondents were aged 50 (held under SN 6137) and the ninth sweep was conducted in 2013 when respondents were aged 55 (held under SN 7669). Four separate datasets covering responses to NCDS over all sweeps are available. National Child Development Deaths Dataset: Special Licence Access (SN 7717) covers deaths; National Child Development Study Response and Outcomes Dataset (SN 5560) covers all other responses and outcomes; National Child Development Study: Partnership Histories (SN 6940) includes data on live-in relationships; and National Child Development Study: Activity Histories (SN 6942) covers work and non-work activities. Users are advised to order these studies alongside the other waves of NCDS.From 2002-2004, a Biomedical Survey was completed and is available under End User Licence (EUL) (SN 8731) and Special Licence (SL) (SN 5594). Proteomics analyses of blood samples are available under SL SN 9254.Linked Geographical Data (GN 33497): A number of geographical variables are available, under more restrictive access conditions, which can be linked to the NCDS EUL and SL access studies. Linked Administrative Data (GN 33396):A number of linked administrative datasets are available, under more restrictive access conditions, which can be linked to the NCDS EUL and SL access studies. These include a Deaths dataset (SN 7717) available under SL and the Linked Health Administrative Datasets (SN 8697) available under Secure Access.Additional Sub-Studies (GN 33562):In addition to the main NCDS sweeps, further studies have also been conducted on a range of subjects such as parent migration, unemployment, behavioural studies and respondent essays. The full list of NCDS studies available from the UK Data Service can be found on the NCDS series access data webpage.  How to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:For information on how to access biomedical data from NCDS that are not held at the UKDS, see the CLS Genetic data and biological samples webpage.Further information about the full NCDS series can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies website.  The purpose of the National Child Development Study: Activity Histories, 1974-2013 was to merge all data on work and non-work activities in successive sweeps into one longitudinal dataset. Data on work and non-work activities lasting one month or more have been collected in all NCDS sweeps from sweep 4 (age 23) onwards. \n\nThe focus of the questions asked at each sweep vary from: work activities engaged in since leaving school (sweep 4 aged 23); work and non-work activities engaged in since leaving school (sweep 5, aged 33); work and non-work activities engaged in since the last sweep (sweep 6, aged 42); work and non-work activities engaged in since the last sweep or aged 16 (sweep 7, aged 46) work and non-work activities engaged in since 2000, or 2004 if included in sweep 7 (sweep 8, aged 50), work and non-work activities engaged in since 2004, or 2008 if included in sweep 8 (sweep 9, aged 55). Therefore the activity histories will start from the time that the cohort member left school and continue until the interview date of the latest data sweep that each cohort member participated in.                                                                       \n\nThe lengths of the activity histories vary depending on the latest sweep that a cohort member was present at. The minimum activity history length recorded is 1 month and the maximum is 480 months (40 years). Gaps in the activity histories occur where a cohort member has not been present at all sweeps and/or where full activity data were not reported.\n\nAn employment histories dataset was previously created (Ward, 2007). This work was undertaken as part of the Gender Network Project. The current work on NCDS activity histories builds on this previous activity history and incorporates various cleaning of the data. This previous employment history included data up to sweep 7 (2004) only, did not deal with any non-work activities and did not identify duplicate activities (i.e. where an activity was reported again in a later sweep). \n\nLatest Edition Information\nFor the second edition (June 2016) the data and documentation were updated to include the latest NCDS wave, extending coverage to 2013.\n\n The NCDS Activity Histories dataset contains one record for each work or non-work activity.","url":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/national-child-development-study-activity-histories-1974-2013-ncds","identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-6942-3"],"keywords":["Covid-19 data collection","Biomarkers","Cognitive measures","Work and employment","Social care - receipt","Political and social attitudes","Parenting and family","Social care - provision","Sexuality and gender identity","Migration and immigration","Education","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Reproductive health","Loneliness and social isolation","Language and literacy","Physical health assessment","Housing","Sleep problems","Social care - need","Victimisation and life events","Diet and nutrition"],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of London, Institute of Education, Centre for Longitudinal Studies"}]}c:["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":[["$","$L16",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$17"}}],"$L18"]}]

This previous employment history included data up to sweep 7 (2004) only, did not deal with any non-work activities and did not identify duplicate activities (i.e. where an activity was reported again in a later sweep). 

Latest Edition Information
For the second edition (June 2016) the data and documentation were updated to include the latest NCDS wave, extending coverage to 2013.

 The NCDS Activity Histories dataset contains one record for each work or non-work activity.1b:T41b,The 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS) follows the lives of 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1958.

The National Child Development Study started in 1958 as the Perinatal Mortality Survey. Sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund, the survey was designed to examine the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy among the children born in Great Britain.

By collecting information on various aspects of life, the NCDS has become an invaluable data source on such diverse topics as effects of socioeconomic circumstances on health, social mobility and changes in social attitudes. Today, the 1958 cohort is one of the best resources for understanding how retirement and ageing are changing in Britain.

With quantitative and qualitative, social and biomedical data, the 1958 cohort is a leading resource for both policy development and best practice in longitudinal research.

1c:T190b,The National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a continuing longitudinal study that seeks to follow the lives of all those living in Great Britain who were born in one particular week in 1958. The aim of the study is to improve understanding of the factors affecting human development over the whole lifespan. The NCDS has its origins in the Perinatal Mortality Survey (PMS) (the original PMS study is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 2137). This study was sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund and designed to examine the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy among the 17,000 children born in England, Scotland and Wales in that one week. Selected data from the PMS form NCDS sweep 0, held alongside NCDS sweeps 1-3, under SN 5565. Survey and Biomeasures Data (GN 33004):To date there have been nine attempts to trace all members of the birth cohort in order to monitor their physical, educational and social development. The first three sweeps were carried out by the National Children's Bureau, in 1965, when respondents were aged 7, in 1969, aged 11, and in 1974, aged 16 (these sweeps form NCDS1-3, held together with NCDS0 under SN 5565). The fourth sweep, also carried out by the National Children's Bureau, was conducted in 1981, when respondents were aged 23 (held under SN 5566). In 1985 the NCDS moved to the Social Statistics Research Unit (SSRU) - now known as the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS). The fifth sweep was carried out in 1991, when respondents were aged 33 (held under SN 5567). For the sixth sweep, conducted in 1999-2000, when respondents were aged 42 (NCDS6, held under SN 5578), fieldwork was combined with the 1999-2000 wave of the 1970 Birth Cohort Study (BCS70), which was also conducted by CLS (and held under GN 33229). The seventh sweep was conducted in 2004-2005 when the respondents were aged 46 (held under SN 5579), the eighth sweep was conducted in 2008-2009 when respondents were aged 50 (held under SN 6137) and the ninth sweep was conducted in 2013 when respondents were aged 55 (held under SN 7669). Four separate datasets covering responses to NCDS over all sweeps are available. National Child Development Deaths Dataset: Special Licence Access (SN 7717) covers deaths; National Child Development Study Response and Outcomes Dataset (SN 5560) covers all other responses and outcomes; National Child Development Study: Partnership Histories (SN 6940) includes data on live-in relationships; and National Child Development Study: Activity Histories (SN 6942) covers work and non-work activities. Users are advised to order these studies alongside the other waves of NCDS.From 2002-2004, a Biomedical Survey was completed and is available under End User Licence (EUL) (SN 8731) and Special Licence (SL) (SN 5594). Proteomics analyses of blood samples are available under SL SN 9254.Linked Geographical Data (GN 33497): A number of geographical variables are available, under more restrictive access conditions, which can be linked to the NCDS EUL and SL access studies. Linked Administrative Data (GN 33396):A number of linked administrative datasets are available, under more restrictive access conditions, which can be linked to the NCDS EUL and SL access studies. These include a Deaths dataset (SN 7717) available under SL and the Linked Health Administrative Datasets (SN 8697) available under Secure Access.Additional Sub-Studies (GN 33562):In addition to the main NCDS sweeps, further studies have also been conducted on a range of subjects such as parent migration, unemployment, behavioural studies and respondent essays. The full list of NCDS studies available from the UK Data Service can be found on the NCDS series access data webpage.  How to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:For information on how to access biomedical data from NCDS that are not held at the UKDS, see the CLS Genetic data and biological samples webpage.Further information about the full NCDS series can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies website.  The purpose of the National Child Development Study: Activity Histories, 1974-2013 was to merge all data on work and non-work activities in successive sweeps into one longitudinal dataset. Data on work and non-work activities lasting one month or more have been collected in all NCDS sweeps from sweep 4 (age 23) onwards. 

The focus of the questions asked at each sweep vary from: work activities engaged in since leaving school (sweep 4 aged 23); work and non-work activities engaged in since leaving school (sweep 5, aged 33); work and non-work activities engaged in since the last sweep (sweep 6, aged 42); work and non-work activities engaged in since the last sweep or aged 16 (sweep 7, aged 46) work and non-work activities engaged in since 2000, or 2004 if included in sweep 7 (sweep 8, aged 50), work and non-work activities engaged in since 2004, or 2008 if included in sweep 8 (sweep 9, aged 55). Therefore the activity histories will start from the time that the cohort member left school and continue until the interview date of the latest data sweep that each cohort member participated in.                                                                       

The lengths of the activity histories vary depending on the latest sweep that a cohort member was present at. The minimum activity history length recorded is 1 month and the maximum is 480 months (40 years). Gaps in the activity histories occur where a cohort member has not been present at all sweeps and/or where full activity data were not reported.

An employment histories dataset was previously created (Ward, 2007). This work was undertaken as part of the Gender Network Project. The current work on NCDS activity histories builds on this previous activity history and incorporates various cleaning of the data. This previous employment history included data up to sweep 7 (2004) only, did not deal with any non-work activities and did not identify duplicate activities (i.e. where an activity was reported again in a later sweep). 

Latest Edition Information
For the second edition (June 2016) the data and documentation were updated to include the latest NCDS wave, extending coverage to 2013.

 The NCDS Activity Histories dataset contains one record for each work or non-work activity.10:{"metadata":[["$","title","0",{"children":"National Child Development Study: Activity Histories, 1974-2013 / NCDS"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"$1c"}],"$L1d","$L1e","$L1f","$L20","$L21","$L22","$L23","$L24","$L25","$L26","$L27","$L28","$L29","$L2a","$L2b","$L2c"],"error":null,"digest":"$undefined"}
