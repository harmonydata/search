12:T1dba,{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"National Child Development Study: Biomedical Survey: Medication, Childhood Adversity and Sensitive Biomeasures, 2002-2004: Special Licence Access","description":"The National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a continuing longitudinal study that seeks to follow the lives of all those living in Great Britain who were born in one particular week in 1958. The aim of the study is to improve understanding of the factors affecting human development over the whole lifespan. The NCDS has its origins in the Perinatal Mortality Survey (PMS) (the original PMS study is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 2137). This study was sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund and designed to examine the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy among the 17,000 children born in England, Scotland and Wales in that one week. Selected data from the PMS form NCDS sweep 0, held alongside NCDS sweeps 1-3, under SN 5565. Survey and Biomeasures Data (GN 33004):To date there have been nine attempts to trace all members of the birth cohort in order to monitor their physical, educational and social development. The first three sweeps were carried out by the National Children's Bureau, in 1965, when respondents were aged 7, in 1969, aged 11, and in 1974, aged 16 (these sweeps form NCDS1-3, held together with NCDS0 under SN 5565). The fourth sweep, also carried out by the National Children's Bureau, was conducted in 1981, when respondents were aged 23 (held under SN 5566). In 1985 the NCDS moved to the Social Statistics Research Unit (SSRU) - now known as the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS). The fifth sweep was carried out in 1991, when respondents were aged 33 (held under SN 5567). For the sixth sweep, conducted in 1999-2000, when respondents were aged 42 (NCDS6, held under SN 5578), fieldwork was combined with the 1999-2000 wave of the 1970 Birth Cohort Study (BCS70), which was also conducted by CLS (and held under GN 33229). The seventh sweep was conducted in 2004-2005 when the respondents were aged 46 (held under SN 5579), the eighth sweep was conducted in 2008-2009 when respondents were aged 50 (held under SN 6137) and the ninth sweep was conducted in 2013 when respondents were aged 55 (held under SN 7669). Four separate datasets covering responses to NCDS over all sweeps are available. National Child Development Deaths Dataset: Special Licence Access (SN 7717) covers deaths; National Child Development Study Response and Outcomes Dataset (SN 5560) covers all other responses and outcomes; National Child Development Study: Partnership Histories (SN 6940) includes data on live-in relationships; and National Child Development Study: Activity Histories (SN 6942) covers work and non-work activities. Users are advised to order these studies alongside the other waves of NCDS.From 2002-2004, a Biomedical Survey was completed and is available under End User Licence (EUL) (SN 8731) and Special Licence (SL) (SN 5594). Proteomics analyses of blood samples are available under SL SN 9254.Linked Geographical Data (GN 33497): A number of geographical variables are available, under more restrictive access conditions, which can be linked to the NCDS EUL and SL access studies. Linked Administrative Data (GN 33396):A number of linked administrative datasets are available, under more restrictive access conditions, which can be linked to the NCDS EUL and SL access studies. These include a Deaths dataset (SN 7717) available under SL and the Linked Health Administrative Datasets (SN 8697) available under Secure Access.Additional Sub-Studies (GN 33562):In addition to the main NCDS sweeps, further studies have also been conducted on a range of subjects such as parent migration, unemployment, behavioural studies and respondent essays. The full list of NCDS studies available from the UK Data Service can be found on the NCDS series access data webpage.  How to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:For information on how to access biomedical data from NCDS that are not held at the UKDS, see the CLS Genetic data and biological samples webpage.Further information about the full NCDS series can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies website.  The National Child Development Study: Biomedical Survey 2002-2004 was funded under the Medical Research Council 'Health of the Public' initiative, and was carried out in 2002-2004 in collaboration with the Institute of Child Health, St George's Hospital Medical School, and NatCen. The survey was designed to obtain objective measures of ill-health and biomedical risk factors in order to address a wide range of specific hypotheses relating to anthropometry: cardiovascular, respiratory and allergic diseases; visual and hearing impairment; and mental ill-health. The majority of the biomedical data (1,064 variables) are now available under EUL (SN 8731), with some data considered sensitive still available under Special Licence (SN 5594). This decision was the result of the CLS's disclosure assessment of each variable and the broad aim to make as much data available with the lowest possible barriers. Information about the medication taken by the cohort members of the study is also available under EUL for the first time. These data were collected in 2002-2004, but they were never released via the UKDS. The Special Licence dataset contains 122 variables including new data on child adversity not previously released, as well as a number of original variables that were previously available under Special Licence due to their sensitive nature, such as Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) specific questions on mental health and questions which contain categories with small frequencies related to personal details such as skin colour, pregnancy, a surgical operation, specific height and unusual high number of children. For the second edition (December 2020), the data and documentation have been revised. Previously unreleased variables on child adversity have been added and some variables removed as they are now available under EUL. Users are advised to download the EUL version (SN 8731) before deciding to apply for the Special Licence version. \n Biomedical data were gathered from a number of biomedical measurements administered by nurses, including: near, distance and stereo vision; hearing; lung function; blood pressure and pulse, height and weight; and waist and hip circumference. A short mental health interview was also administered, and samples of blood and saliva were taken.","url":"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/national-child-development-study-biomedical-survey-medication-childhood-adversity-and-sensitive-biomeasures-2002-2004-special-licence-access","keywords":["Migration and immigration","Social care - need","Work and employment","Language and literacy","Reproductive health","Diet and nutrition","Covid-19 data collection","Education","Sexuality and gender identity","Physical health assessment","Loneliness and social isolation","Social care - provision","Housing","Biomarkers","Sleep problems","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Political and social attitudes","Parenting and family","Victimisation and life events","Cognitive measures","Social care - receipt"],"identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-5594-3"],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UK Data Service","url":"https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=5594"}],"size":"18558"}14:T1931,The National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a continuing longitudinal study that seeks to follow the lives of all those living in Great Britain who were born in one particular week in 1958.

A short mental health interview was also administered, and samples of blood and saliva were taken.a:[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$12"}}],["$","$L13",null,{"dataset":{"title":"National Child Development Study: Biomedical Survey: Medication, Childhood Adversity and Sensitive Biomeasures, 2002-2004: Special Licence Access","description":"$14","image":"$undefined","publisher":"$undefined","funders":"$undefined","geographicCoverage":"GB","temporalCoverage":"$undefined","ageCoverage":"$undefined","studyDesign":["cohort","longitudinal"],"resourceType":"dataset","topics":["Migration and immigration","Social care - need","Work and employment","Language and literacy","Reproductive health","Diet and nutrition","Covid-19 data collection","Education","Sexuality and gender identity","Physical health assessment","Loneliness and social isolation","Social care - provision","Housing","Biomarkers","Sleep problems","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Political and social attitudes","Parenting and family","Victimisation and life events","Cognitive measures","Social care - receipt"],"instruments":[],"dataCatalogs":[{"name":"UK Data Service","url":"https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=5594","logo":"$undefined"}],"matchedVariables":[],"allVariables":[],"additionalLinks":["https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=5594","http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-5594-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-5594-3"],"child_datasets":[],"aiSummary":null}}]]
15:T1931,The National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a continuing longitudinal study that seeks to follow the lives of all those living in Great Britain who were born in one particular week in 1958. The aim of the study is to improve understanding of the factors affecting human development over the whole lifespan. The NCDS has its origins in the Perinatal Mortality Survey (PMS) (the original PMS study is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 2137). This study was sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund and designed to examine the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy among the 17,000 children born in England, Scotland and Wales in that one week. Selected data from the PMS form NCDS sweep 0, held alongside NCDS sweeps 1-3, under SN 5565. Survey and Biomeasures Data (GN 33004):To date there have been nine attempts to trace all members of the birth cohort in order to monitor their physical, educational and social development. The first three sweeps were carried out by the National Children's Bureau, in 1965, when respondents were aged 7, in 1969, aged 11, and in 1974, aged 16 (these sweeps form NCDS1-3, held together with NCDS0 under SN 5565). The fourth sweep, also carried out by the National Children's Bureau, was conducted in 1981, when respondents were aged 23 (held under SN 5566). In 1985 the NCDS moved to the Social Statistics Research Unit (SSRU) - now known as the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS). The fifth sweep was carried out in 1991, when respondents were aged 33 (held under SN 5567). For the sixth sweep, conducted in 1999-2000, when respondents were aged 42 (NCDS6, held under SN 5578), fieldwork was combined with the 1999-2000 wave of the 1970 Birth Cohort Study (BCS70), which was also conducted by CLS (and held under GN 33229). The seventh sweep was conducted in 2004-2005 when the respondents were aged 46 (held under SN 5579), the eighth sweep was conducted in 2008-2009 when respondents were aged 50 (held under SN 6137) and the ninth sweep was conducted in 2013 when respondents were aged 55 (held under SN 7669). Four separate datasets covering responses to NCDS over all sweeps are available. National Child Development Deaths Dataset: Special Licence Access (SN 7717) covers deaths; National Child Development Study Response and Outcomes Dataset (SN 5560) covers all other responses and outcomes; National Child Development Study: Partnership Histories (SN 6940) includes data on live-in relationships; and National Child Development Study: Activity Histories (SN 6942) covers work and non-work activities. Users are advised to order these studies alongside the other waves of NCDS.From 2002-2004, a Biomedical Survey was completed and is available under End User Licence (EUL) (SN 8731) and Special Licence (SL) (SN 5594). Proteomics analyses of blood samples are available under SL SN 9254.Linked Geographical Data (GN 33497): A number of geographical variables are available, under more restrictive access conditions, which can be linked to the NCDS EUL and SL access studies. Linked Administrative Data (GN 33396):A number of linked administrative datasets are available, under more restrictive access conditions, which can be linked to the NCDS EUL and SL access studies. These include a Deaths dataset (SN 7717) available under SL and the Linked Health Administrative Datasets (SN 8697) available under Secure Access.Additional Sub-Studies (GN 33562):In addition to the main NCDS sweeps, further studies have also been conducted on a range of subjects such as parent migration, unemployment, behavioural studies and respondent essays. The full list of NCDS studies available from the UK Data Service can be found on the NCDS series access data webpage.  How to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:For information on how to access biomedical data from NCDS that are not held at the UKDS, see the CLS Genetic data and biological samples webpage.Further information about the full NCDS series can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies website.  The National Child Development Study: Biomedical Survey 2002-2004 was funded under the Medical Research Council 'Health of the Public' initiative, and was carried out in 2002-2004 in collaboration with the Institute of Child Health, St George's Hospital Medical School, and NatCen. The survey was designed to obtain objective measures of ill-health and biomedical risk factors in order to address a wide range of specific hypotheses relating to anthropometry: cardiovascular, respiratory and allergic diseases; visual and hearing impairment; and mental ill-health. The majority of the biomedical data (1,064 variables) are now available under EUL (SN 8731), with some data considered sensitive still available under Special Licence (SN 5594). This decision was the result of the CLS's disclosure assessment of each variable and the broad aim to make as much data available with the lowest possible barriers. Information about the medication taken by the cohort members of the study is also available under EUL for the first time. These data were collected in 2002-2004, but they were never released via the UKDS. The Special Licence dataset contains 122 variables including new data on child adversity not previously released, as well as a number of original variables that were previously available under Special Licence due to their sensitive nature, such as Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) specific questions on mental health and questions which contain categories with small frequencies related to personal details such as skin colour, pregnancy, a surgical operation, specific height and unusual high number of children. For the second edition (December 2020), the data and documentation have been revised. Previously unreleased variables on child adversity have been added and some variables removed as they are now available under EUL. Users are advised to download the EUL version (SN 8731) before deciding to apply for the Special Licence version.
