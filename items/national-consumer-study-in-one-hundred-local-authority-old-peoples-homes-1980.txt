(a) to assess the reaction of elderly residents in LA Homes to their present environment and to interpret the practical implications this may have for planners and architects;
(b) to explore the attitudes of old people to residential care and identify consumer preferences, or aspirations for environmental improvement;
(c) to investigate attitudes and experiences of staff and to look at the impact of physical environment of the home on working life;
(d) to determine the way in which quality of life may be influenced by a range of factors relating to the physical environment, institutional environment and resident mix
(e) to determine the importance of locational factors.

An associated qualitative dataset,  <i>Consumer Study in Old People's Homes : Four Homes Studied in Detail</i>, is available via Qualidata at the University of Essex.  The main variables studied were:
(a) Physical environment, e.g. building features, floors, facilities, room sizes, etc.
