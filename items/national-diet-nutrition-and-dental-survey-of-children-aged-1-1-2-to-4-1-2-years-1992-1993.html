(For details of the previous NDNS series, which began in 1992, see the documentation for studies 3481, 4036, 4243 and 5140.)The programme is funded by Public Health England (PHE), an executive agency of the Department of Health, and the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA).The NDNS RP is currently carried out by a consortium comprising NatCen Social Research (NatCen) (NatCen, contract lead) and the MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge (scientific lead). The MRC Epidemiology Unit joined the consortium in November 2017. Until December 2018, the consortium included the MRC Elsie Widdowson Laboratory, Cambridge (former scientific lead). In Years 1 to 5 (2008/09 – 2012/13) the consortium also included the University College London Medical School (UCL).Survey activities at the MRC Epidemiology Unit are delivered with the support of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre (IS-BRC-1215- 20014), comprising the NIHR BRC Nutritional Biomarker Laboratory and NIHR BRC Dietary Assessment and Physical Activity Group. The NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre is a partnership between Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Cambridge, funded by the NIHR. The NDNS RP provides the only source of high quality, nationally representative UK data on the types and quantities of foods consumed by individuals, from which estimates of nutrient intake for the population are derived. Results are used by Government to develop policy and monitor progress toward diet and nutrition objectives of UK Health Departments, for example work to tackle obesity and monitor progress towards a healthy, balanced diet as visually depicted in the Eatwell Guide. The NDNS RP provides an important source of evidence underpinning the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) work relating to national nutrition policy. The food consumption data are also used by the FSA to assess exposure to chemicals in food, as part of the risk assessment and communication process in response to a food emergency or to inform negotiations on setting regulatory limits for contaminants.Further information is available from the gov.uk National Diet and Nutrition Survey webpage. The survey of children aged 1 1/2 to 4 1/2 years provides detailed information on the current dietary behaviour and nutritional status of a representative sample of pre-school children.  Additionally this survey provides data to assist with the development of dietary guidelines for pre-school children; characterises the socio-demographic and domestic circumstances which may affect how young children are fed; determines the pattern of stool frequency in this age group; provides baseline data for some anthropometric and biochemical indices in this age group; and provides information on the dental habits and dental condition of pre-school children.
The dental survey aimed to provide baseline information about the  condition of pre-school children&#x27;s teeth.  Trauma and erosion were  also assessed and dental behaviour was investigated through an  interview.  The opportunity to investigate links between diet and  dental health was an important reason for linking the dental survey to the dietary survey programme.  Parents provided information about themselves, their household and general information on the child&#x27;s dietary habits. They kept a four-day weighed intake record of all food and drink consumed by the child, both in and out of the home, and a record of the child&#x27;s bowel movements during recording period.  Information was also provided on the use of dietary supplements (eg. vitamin tablets) and all prescribed medicines being taken by the child.  The child&#x27;s height, supine length (for children under 2), weight, mid upper-arm circumference and head circumference measurements were taken, and a sample of blood taken for analysis.
Dental status: each tooth in mouth examined for dental caries (eg.  sound/extracted/filled), for dental trauma and for erosion. 
Dental care: information on visits to the dentist, tooth-brushing  practices, advice on caring for teeth, use of fluoride. 
Eating behaviour: information on use of bottles, dinky feeders and  dummies and on consumption of different drinks and sweet foods.  Some  nutrient intake information. 
Background characteristics: information on socio-demographic and  socio-economic characteristics of children&#x27;s households.

designed to assess the diet, nutrient intake and nutritional status of the general population aged 1.5 years and over living in private households in the UK. (For details of the previous NDNS series, which began in 1992, see the documentation for studies 3481, 4036, 4243 and 5140.)The programme is funded by Public Health England (PHE), an executive agency of the Department of Health, and the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA).The NDNS RP is currently carried out by a consortium comprising NatCen Social Research (NatCen) (NatCen, contract lead) and the MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge (scientific lead). The MRC Epidemiology Unit joined the consortium in November 2017. Until December 2018, the consortium included the MRC Elsie Widdowson Laboratory, Cambridge (former scientific lead). In Years 1 to 5 (2008/09 – 2012/13) the consortium also included the University College London Medical School (UCL).Survey activities at the MRC Epidemiology Unit are delivered with the support of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre (IS-BRC-1215- 20014), comprising the NIHR BRC Nutritional Biomarker Laboratory and NIHR BRC Dietary Assessment and Physical Activity Group. The NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre is a partnership between Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Cambridge, funded by the NIHR. The NDNS RP provides the only source of high quality, nationally representative UK data on the types and quantities of foods consumed by individuals, from which estimates of nutrient intake for the population are derived. Results are used by Government to develop policy and monitor progress toward diet and nutrition objectives of UK Health Departments, for example work to tackle obesity and monitor progress towards a healthy, balanced diet as visually depicted in the Eatwell Guide. The NDNS RP provides an important source of evidence underpinning the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) work relating to national nutrition policy. The food consumption data are also used by the FSA to assess exposure to chemicals in food, as part of the risk assessment and communication process in response to a food emergency or to inform negotiations on setting regulatory limits for contaminants.Further information is available from the gov.uk National Diet and Nutrition Survey webpage. The survey of children aged 1 1/2 to 4 1/2 years provides detailed information on the current dietary behaviour and nutritional status of a representative sample of pre-school children.  Additionally this survey provides data to assist with the development of dietary guidelines for pre-school children; characterises the socio-demographic and domestic circumstances which may affect how young children are fed; determines the pattern of stool frequency in this age group; provides baseline data for some anthropometric and biochemical indices in this age group; and provides information on the dental habits and dental condition of pre-school children.\\nThe dental survey aimed to provide baseline information about the  condition of pre-school children's teeth.  Trauma and erosion were  also assessed and dental behaviour was investigated through an  interview.  The opportunity to investigate links between diet and  dental health was an important reason for linking the dental survey to the dietary survey programme.  Parents provided information about themselves, their household and general information on the child's dietary habits. They kept a four-day weighed intake record of all food and drink consumed by the child, both in and out of the home, and a record of the child's bowel movements during recording period.  Information was also provided on the use of dietary supplements (eg. vitamin tablets) and all prescribed medicines being taken by the child.  The child's height, supine length (for children under 2), weight, mid upper-arm circumference and head circumference measurements were taken, and a sample of blood taken for analysis.\\nDental status: each tooth in mouth examined for dental caries (eg.  sound/extracted/filled), for dental trauma and for erosion. \\nDental care: information on visits to the dentist, tooth-brushing  practices, advice on caring for teeth, use of fluoride. \\nEating behaviour: information on use of bottles, dinky feeders and  dummies and on consumption of different drinks and sweet foods.

Results are used by Government to develop policy and monitor progress toward diet and nutrition objectives of UK Health Departments, for example work to tackle obesity and monitor progress towards a healthy, balanced diet as visually depicted in the Eatwell Guide. The NDNS RP provides an important source of evidence underpinning the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) work relating to national nutrition policy. The food consumption data are also used by the FSA to assess exposure to chemicals in food, as part of the risk assessment and communication process in response to a food emergency or to inform negotiations on setting regulatory limits for contaminants.Further information is available from the gov.uk National Diet and Nutrition Survey webpage. The survey of children aged 1 1/2 to 4 1/2 years provides detailed information on the current dietary behaviour and nutritional status of a representative sample of pre-school children.  Additionally this survey provides data to assist with the development of dietary guidelines for pre-school children; characterises the socio-demographic and domestic circumstances which may affect how young children are fed; determines the pattern of stool frequency in this age group; provides baseline data for some anthropometric and biochemical indices in this age group; and provides information on the dental habits and dental condition of pre-school children.\nThe dental survey aimed to provide baseline information about the  condition of pre-school children's teeth.  Trauma and erosion were  also assessed and dental behaviour was investigated through an  interview.  The opportunity to investigate links between diet and  dental health was an important reason for linking the dental survey to the dietary survey programme.  Parents provided information about themselves, their household and general information on the child's dietary habits. They kept a four-day weighed intake record of all food and drink consumed by the child, both in and out of the home, and a record of the child's bowel movements during recording period.  Information was also provided on the use of dietary supplements (eg. vitamin tablets) and all prescribed medicines being taken by the child.  The child's height, supine length (for children under 2), weight, mid upper-arm circumference and head circumference measurements were taken, and a sample of blood taken for analysis.\nDental status: each tooth in mouth examined for dental caries (eg.  sound/extracted/filled), for dental trauma and for erosion. \nDental care: information on visits to the dentist, tooth-brushing  practices, advice on caring for teeth, use of fluoride. \nEating behaviour: information on use of bottles, dinky feeders and  dummies and on consumption of different drinks and sweet foods.  Some  nutrient intake information. \nBackground characteristics: information on socio-demographic and  socio-economic characteristics of children's households. \nMeasurement scales \nSocial class was coded based on Registrar General's Standard  Occupational Classification."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"28:[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$2d\"}]\n29:[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}]\n2a:[\"$\",\"link\",\"16\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]\n2b:[\"$\",\"$L2e\",\"17\",{}]\n14:\"$10:metadata\"\n"])</script></body></html>
