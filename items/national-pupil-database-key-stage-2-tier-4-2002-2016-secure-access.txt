Tier four represents less sensitive data than tiers two and three.  Included are individual pupil level extracts that do not contain information about pupils and their characteristics which are considered to be identifying or described as sensitive personal data within the Data Protection Act 1998. For example, the extracts may include information about pupil attainment, prior attainment, progression and pupil absences but do not include any identifying data items like names and addresses and any information about pupil characteristics other than gender.

Extracts from the NPD are also available directly from the Department of Education through GOV.UK's National pupil database: apply for a data extract web page.

 The fourth edition (September 2017) includes a data file and documentation for the year 2016.

 The NPD data held by the UK Data Archive include detailed information about pupils’ test and exam results, prior attainment and progression at key stages for all schools in the state sector in England. The NPD also includes attainment data for pupils and students in non-maintained special schools, sixth-form and Further Education colleges and (where available) independent schools.

The NPD data held under SN 7626 include pupil-level data for Key Stage 2 (ages 7-11) matched to prior attainment for Key Stage 1 (ages 5-7) and School Census/Pupil Level Annual Schools Census information.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"National Pupil Database, Key Stage 2, Tier 4, 2002-2016: Secure Access"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"National Pupil Database, Key Stage 2, Tier 4, 2002-2016: Secure Access"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/national-pupil-database-key-stage-2-tier-4-2002-2016-secure-access"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"National Pupil Database, Key Stage 2, Tier 4, 2002-2016: Secure Access"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"National Pupil Database, Key Stage 2, Tier 4, 2002-2016: Secure Access"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
