Potential victims of modern slavery in the UK that come to the attention of authorised ‘First Responder’ organisations are referred to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM). 
Adults (aged 18 or above) must consent to being referred to the NRM, whilst children under the age of 18 need not consent to being referred. As specified in section 52 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, public authorities in England and Wales have a statutory duty to notify the Home Office when they come across potential victims of modern slavery (&#x27;Duty to Notify&#x27; (DtN)). This duty is discharged by either referring a child or consenting adult potential victim into the NRM, or by notifying the Home Office via the DtN process if an adult victim does not consent to enter the NRM.
The Home Office publishes quarterly statistical bulletins and aggregated data breakdowns on the

National Referral Mechanism webpage on the GOV.UK website regarding the number of potential victims referred each quarter. To allow stakeholders and first responders more flexibility in analysing this data for their own strategic and operational planning, the disaggregated, pseudonymised dataset used to create the aggregated published data is also available from the UK Data Service as &#x27;safeguarded&#x27; data. (The UKDS data are available in SPSS, Stata, tab-delimited text and CSV formats.) Latest edition informationFor the 16th edition (May 2025), the data file was amended to include Quarter 1 2025 cases, and the Data Notes documentation file was also updated. Additional variables covering reconsideration requests have been added to the data. Further information on these can be found in the documentation and on the GOV.UK National Referral Mechanism webpage.
The UKDS version of the NRM dataset includes:
