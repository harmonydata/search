The aim of the National Study of Health and Growth (NSHG) was to set up an anthropometric system of surveillance on selected growth, nutritional and health characteristics that could identify the effects of the changes in food policy. Height was chosen as the main indicator of nutritional status together with weight and triceps skinfold thickness. The primary aim of the study was to estimate trends in anthropometric measurements for children of the same age. Although changes in rate of growth at a given age may occur over time, the main question to be answered was whether there had been any overall shift in the position of the growth curve.\n The aim of the second phase of the study was to continue the collection of basic information for monitoring the nutritional status of primary school children in all previous areas, with the additional collection of selected information for associated studies from a suitable subset of other areas. Further details are given in Appendix 3 of the User Guide for this study (3986).  For all five years of this study (1977-1981), measurements of age, gender, height, weight, triceps skinfold thickness, ethnic origin for all children, and for girls maturation status, were recorded. Information is also included for most children on birthweight, length of gestation, past history of respiratory illnesses, number of siblings, current consumption of school milk and meals and other milk (as supplied by the mother or guardian). Details on household composition, social class, education and employment of parents/guardians, height of natural parents and receipt of benefits are recorded where available.\nThe 1977 data includes additional details on domestic accommodation, heating and cooking arrangements and smoking habits of residents.\nThe 1981 data includes parental attitudes to school meals.\nMedical data on infectious disease in 1979 are not included.\nPersonal identification details have been removed from each record (name and address).\nChildren born before 1973 are likely to have related data collected in phase I of the study.

Height was measured on a specially designed Holtain stadiometer to the last complete 0.5cm as recorded by Tanner et al (1966 - see reference below).
Triceps skinfold measurements were taken as recommended by Tanner and Whitehouse (1962a - see reference below) except that the midpoint between the tip of the acromion and olecranon was marked with the arm hanging straight instead of bent.

Maturational status was recorded according to Tanner (1962)b.

Registrar General, (1980) <i>Classification of occupations</i>, London: HMSO.18:Teee,Following changes in the provision of welfare, school milk and school meals in 1971, studies were set up to assess the possible effects of these changes upon the nutritional state of the population. The aim of the National Study of Health and Growth (NSHG) was to set up an anthropometric system of surveillance on selected growth, nutritional and health characteristics that could identify the effects of the changes in food policy. Height was chosen as the main indicator of nutritional status together with weight and triceps skinfold thickness. The primary aim of the study was to estimate trends in anthropometric measurements for children of the same age. Although changes in rate of growth at a given age may occur over time, the main question to be answered was whether there had been any overall shift in the position of the growth curve.
 The aim of the second phase of the study was to continue the collection of basic information for monitoring the nutritional status of primary school children in all previous areas, with the additional collection of selected information for associated studies from a suitable subset of other areas. Further details are given in Appendix 3 of the User Guide for this study (3986).  For all five years of this study (1977-1981), measurements of age, gender, height, weight, triceps skinfold thickness, ethnic origin for all children, and for girls maturation status, were recorded. Information is also included for most children on birthweight, length of gestation, past history of respiratory illnesses, number of siblings, current consumption of school milk and meals and other milk (as supplied by the mother or guardian). Details on household composition, social class, education and employment of parents/guardians, height of natural parents and receipt of benefits are recorded where available.
The 1977 data includes additional details on domestic accommodation, heating and cooking arrangements and smoking habits of residents.
The 1981 data includes parental attitudes to school meals.
Medical data on infectious disease in 1979 are not included.
Personal identification details have been removed from each record (name and address).
Children born before 1973 are likely to have related data collected in phase I of the study. Survey numbers should tally across years.

Standard Measures
Height was measured on a specially designed Holtain stadiometer to the last complete 0.5cm as recorded by Tanner et al (1966 - see reference below).
Triceps skinfold measurements were taken as recommended by Tanner and Whitehouse (1962a - see reference below) except that the midpoint between the tip of the acromion and olecranon was marked with the arm hanging straight instead of bent. For details see 'Fieldworkers Manual' in Appendix 3 of the User Guide.
Respiratory questions were adapted from the MRC questionnaire on chronic bronchitis.
Maturational status was recorded according to Tanner (1962)b.
Occupation was coded according to the Registrar General's 'Classification of Occupations', 1970 and 1980. Social class was also derived from these sources.
