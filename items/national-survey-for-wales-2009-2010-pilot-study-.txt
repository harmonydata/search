Topics were updated monthly and results published monthly for May to September 2020; from October, topic updates and publications switched to quarterly.The survey continued in telephone mode for 2021-22 onwards, with an online element added from July 2021.

The aim of the National Survey for Wales, 2009-2010: Pilot Study was to test the survey design, but also to provide valuable information for the Welsh Assembly Government on a range of issues.  The pilot survey was based on face-to-face interviews in a randomly chosen sample of households across Wales. In each of these households, the survey covered the head of household and a randomly selected adult (who may also be the head of household). There was also a short self-completion questionnaire for every adult in the household.
