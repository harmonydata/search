Further information is available from the Natsal website.

 The aims of the first National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-1) were to:aid understanding of the epidemiology of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseasesprovide information to guide health education programmes for sexual healthprovide input for models of HIV and AIDSThe objectives of Natsal-1 were to describe existing patterns and assess temporal changes in sexual behaviour in the general population, and to associate these with demographic characteristics and attitudes to different lifestyles and knowledge of possible associated risks. 

In order to preserve respondent confidentiality, the geographic ward variable has been removed from the data file and postcode sector (four digits) has been reduced to postcode district (three digits).  If ward or postcode sector level data are required, one of the four principal investigators should be contacted.

A follow-up survey, Discrimination Against Gay Men and Lesbians, 1993 is held at the UKDA under SN 3553. The two datasets may be linked via serial number.

 Topics covered include: general health, family circumstances and learning about sex; past sexual history, including age at first heterosexual and homosexual experience, age at first intercourse and nature of the relationship and timing of  subsequent heterosexual experience; nature of current relationship and experience of marriage, cohabitation, divorce and separation; sexual orientation, prevalence and attitude towards different orientations; sexual practices, including past and current experience and frequency of sex; numbers and gender of sexual partners in different time periods; paying for sex (men only); sexual health, knowledge of AIDS and HIV, experience of infertility; abortion and miscarriage (women only); attendance at STD clinics, sources of advice, drug use and HIV antibody testing; risk reduction behaviour, perceived control of sexual health, knowledge and experience of safer sex practices, use of contraception; psychosocial factors influencing sexual behaviour such as source of information about sex (eg. family, friends and school) and attitudes towards different sexual lifestyles; demographic characteristics.

Standard Measures
Coding used: Occupation Code (OPCS, 1980); Socio-economic Group (OPCS, 1980); Standard Industrial Classification (OPCS, 1980).
