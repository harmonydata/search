2d:Tc1e,The British National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal) have been undertaken decennially since 1990 and provide a key data source underpinning sexual and reproductive health (SRH) policy. Further information is available from the Natsal website.

 The National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, 2000-2001 (Natsal-2) was very closely modelled on the Natsal-1, carried out by the same team of investigators. The results from the first survey were widely used by academics and policymakers. Towards the end of the 1990s, it became increasingly clear that the Natsal-1 results were growing outdated and that repeat measures were needed not only to provide up-to-date information for estimating the likely extent of the HIV epidemic in Britain, but also to look at behaviour change over time and to include new questions to take account of current information needs in the field of sexual health.

The main objectives of Natsal-2 were to:provide a detailed understanding of patterns of sexual behaviour in Britain (including for example, numbers of sexual partners, frequency of different sexual practices, and homosexual experience)provide data for HIV/AIDS projections in Britainassess whether there have been changes in behaviour since Natsal-1measure the prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis infection, via urine samplesGiven the importance of making comparisons with Natsal-1 data, Natsal-2 was largely a repeat of the 1990 survey. However, it was also recognised that a number of methodological developments in survey research in the intervening period could lead to improvements in the data collection process for Natsal-2. In particular, the use of Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) and Computer Assisted Self-Interview (CASI) techniques had the potential to improve on response rates and data quality, as well as maximise the disclosure of sensitive behaviours.

Along with the changes in methodology, there were a number of other differences between Natsal-1 and 2:Natsal-2 covered a younger age group (ages 16-44) than Natsal-1 (16-59) in order to focus survey resources on a group greater at riskpeople living in the Greater London area were purposely over-sampleda boost sample of people from four ethnic minority groups - Black Caribbean, Black African, Indian and Pakistani - was includednew question modules were introduced on, for example, partnership formation, sexual mixing abroad, preferred sources of contraception and advice, history of sexually transmitted infections, and sexual dysfunctiona urine specimen was collected from consenting respondents, to test for chlamydia trachomatis
 The face-to-face interview included sections on: general health, family, learning about sex, first sexual experience, contraception, attitudes, and household classification. 

The self-completion questionnaire included sections on: sexual attraction and experience, heterosexual sex, homosexual sex, number of partners, sex abroad, most recent partners, paying for sex (males only), miscarriage, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS testing, sexual problems.28:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2d"}]
