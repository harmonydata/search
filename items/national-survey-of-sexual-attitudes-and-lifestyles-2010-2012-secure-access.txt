Three Natsal surveys have taken place to date: Natsal-1 in 1990-1991 (available from the UK Data Archive under SN 3434), Natsal-2 in 1999-2001 (available under SN 5223) and Natsal-3 in 2010-2012 (available under SN 7799, and for Secure Access versions SN 8178 and SN 8179). Further information is available from the Natsal website.
 The National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, 2010-2012 is the third survey in the series. Natsal-3 aimed to provide up-to-date information on key sexual behaviours and risk factors, as well as to look at trends over time by including comparable measures to those used in the previous two surveys, and to include new questions and an extended age range to take account of current information needs in the field of sexual health. 

The main objectives of Natsal-3 were to: provide a detailed understanding of patterns and variability of sexual behaviour in Britain (including, for example, numbers of sexual partners, frequency of different sexual practices, and homosexual experience) provide self-reported estimates of a range of sexual and reproductive health outcomes (including, for example, pregnancy, STI diagnosis, contraception use) and health service useexplore sexual behaviour and function over the life-course by including an older age group (up to age 74) describe changes in sexual activity over time and trends in relationships, reproductive history and patterns of fertility (using Natsal-1, Natsal-2 and Natsal-3) from urine samples, measure the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, type-specific Human Papillomavirus, HIV antibody and Mycoplasma genitaliummeasure the gender-specific distribution of salivary testosterone and its relationship to sexual behaviour, function and ageingSecure Access Datasets
The Natsal-3 Secure Access datasets include additional variables considered too sensitive or disclosive for release under standard End User Licence (EUL) conditions.  Additional variables available in the Secure Access studies (SNs 8178 and 8179) include:detailed geographic variables, including Local Authority Districts and Area Classification for Output Areas Subgroupsrespondent month of birthage when had hysterectomymonth and year of first and most recent sex with partnersoutcomes of pregnanciesage at first stillbirthvariables relating to abortionsage at miscarriage, abortion or still birthmonth of last pregnancygenders and month of birth of childrennumber of children gave birth to in multiple birthsungrouped ethnic groupage when first and last injected non-prescribed drugsdates (months) relating to live-in partnersqualificationsIndices of Multiple DeprivationThe other Secure Access dataset Natsal-3 dataset, SN 8179 (National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, 2010-2012: Biological Data: Secure Access) includes all the variables listed above, plus variables relating to urine and saliva sample tests.
