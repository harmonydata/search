Staff: Concerning the headteacher: age; sex; qualifications; teaching experience; number of years as Head at present school or in previous schools; and likelihood of continuation in present position. Concerning the school as a whole: approximate composition of staff by age and sex; number of probationary teachers on staff at present; number of unqualified teachers; number of teaching units per week carried out by part-time staff; proportion of long-term staff (over 5 years at present school).
3.

A series of questions at the end of the survey attempt to establish the Head's opinion as to most prevalent problems probationers face in terms of teaching, school community life and personal life. A final question asks for means Head uses to advise and assess probationary teachers during first teaching term.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"National Survey of Teachers in Their First Year of Service, 1966-1967; Head Teacher Questionnaire"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$15"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"National Survey of Teachers in Their First Year of Service, 1966-1967; Head Teacher Questionnaire"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/national-survey-of-teachers-in-their-first-year-of-service-1966-1967-head-teacher-questionnaire"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"National Survey of Teachers in Their First Year of Service, 1966-1967; Head Teacher Questionnaire"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"National Survey of Teachers in Their First Year of Service, 1966-1967; Head Teacher Questionnaire"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
