The first survey, covering general practice patients, was carried out in 1998. The second survey, covering Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) patients, took place in 1999.

The aim was to provide data which could be used to inform performance management by highlighting areas in need of improvement. The survey was also designed to give reliable results at Health Trust level so that individual Trusts could use the data to improve performance and so that comparisons could be made between Trusts, as well as providing a detailed national picture and the possibility of measuring future trends.
