The first NTS was commissioned by the Ministry of Transport in 1965. Further periodic surveys were carried out in 1972/73, 1975/76, 1978/79 and 1985/86 (the UK Data Service holds End User Licence data from 1972 onwards and Special Licence and Secure Access data from 2002). Since July 1988 the NTS has been carried out as a continuous survey with field work being carried out in every month of the year, and an annual set sample of over 5,000 addresses. From 2002, the NTS sample was increased approximately threefold, to approximately 15,000 per year. The advantage of the continuous study is that users will be able to discern seasonal and cyclical movements as well as trend changes over time. The NTS is carried out primarily for the purposes of government. The most fundamental use of the National Travel Survey within the Department for Transport (DfT) is as core base data for key transport models. These are critical to the assessment and appraisal of transport scheme proposals (national and local), transport policy proposals, and contribute to the development of our long-term strategy. The NTS data is used to develop consistent sets of transport policies. Because it relates travel to travellers, it makes it possible to relate policies to people and to predict their impact. The survey provides detailed information on different types of travel: where people travel from and to, distance, purpose and mode. The NTS records personal and socio-economic information to distinguish between different types of people, and the differences in the way they travel and how often they do so. The NTS is the only source of national information on subjects such as walking which provide a context for the results of more local studies.

Further information may be found on the gov.uk National Travel Survey web page.

End-User Licence, Special Licence and Secure Access NTS data
The UK Data Archive also holds End User Licence (EUL) NTS data from 1972 onwards (see SNs 2852, 2853, 2855, 3288, 4108, 4583-4585, 6108 and 5340) and Special Licence (SL) NTS data from 1995 onwards (SNs 7804 and 7553). The EUL versions contain a comprehensive range of NTS data at Government Office Region geographic level and should be sufficient for most research needs. The SL versions contain more detailed travel (including accidents), demographic and socio-economic data, and the geographic level is Local Authority/Unitary Authority. These data are subject to more restricted access conditions than EUL. The Secure Access version  contains more detailed information and postcode sector geographies. Secure Access data are subject to further restricted access conditions, including the completion of a training course. For full details of the differences between the EUL, SL and Secure Access NTS, see the document &#x27;7559_nts_table_structures.xls&#x27; in the documentation. Users should always check whether the EUL and SL versions are suitable for their research needs before considering making an application for the Secure Access version.

2020 and 2021 Disclaimer: Due to changes in the methodology of data collection, changes in travel behaviour and a reduction of data collected during 2020 and 2021, as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, care should be taken when interpreting this data and comparing to other years, due to the small sample sizes. Please see the background documentation for further details of these changes.Latest edition information:For the eleventh edition (September 2024), data and documentation for 2023 have been added to the study.Data labelsUsers should note that the SPSS and Stata files for 2023 have been converted from CSV format and do not currently contain variable or value labels. Complete metadata information can be found in the Excel Lookup table files and the NTS Data Extract User Guide within the documentation. The 2002-2022 NTS includes:

attitudinal variables: in 2016 a split-sample experiment was conducted to explore the feasibility of moving attitudinal questions from the household level questionnaire to the individual level questionnaire. From 2017, a CASI module for transport satisfaction questions was added, where one adult from those present during the household interview is randomly selected to complete the satisfaction questions;household variables: address type information, accessibility of public transport, access to amenities, household vehicle access, household composition and household socio-economic information;individual information: age, gender and marital status, social and economic information, frequency of use of various methods of transport, driving licences and type of vehicle driven, employment, occupation and industry details, income, place of work and travel to work, season ticket details, travel difficulties;vehicle information: vehicle type, registration details, parking, fuel type, mileage, engine capacity;trips: day, date and time, main mode, purpose, origin and destination information;stage: mode, number in party, distance, duration, costs;long-distance trips (over 50 miles): stage: mode, purpose, origin and destination

Travel Survey, 2002-2023: Secure Access / NTS\",\"description\":\"The National Travel Survey (NTS) is a series of household surveys designed to provide regular, up-to-date data on personal travel and monitor changes in travel behaviour over time. The first NTS was commissioned by the Ministry of Transport in 1965. Further periodic surveys were carried out in 1972/73, 1975/76, 1978/79 and 1985/86 (the UK Data Service holds End User Licence data from 1972 onwards and Special Licence and Secure Access data from 2002). Since July 1988 the NTS has been carried out as a continuous survey with field work being carried out in every month of the year, and an annual set sample of over 5,000 addresses. From 2002, the NTS sample was increased approximately threefold, to approximately 15,000 per year. The advantage of the continuous study is that users will be able to discern seasonal and cyclical movements as well as trend changes over time. The NTS is carried out primarily for the purposes of government. The most fundamental use of the National Travel Survey within the Department for Transport (DfT) is as core base data for key transport models. These are critical to the assessment and appraisal of transport scheme proposals (national and local), transport policy proposals, and contribute to the development of our long-term strategy. The NTS data is used to develop consistent sets of transport policies. Because it relates travel to travellers, it makes it possible to relate policies to people and to predict their impact. The survey provides detailed information on different types of travel: where people travel from and to, distance, purpose and mode. The NTS records personal and socio-economic information to distinguish between different types of people, and the differences in the way they travel and how often they do so. The NTS is the only source of national information on subjects such as walking which provide a context for the results of more local studies.\\n\\nFurther information may be found on the gov.uk National Travel Survey web page.\\n\\nEnd-User Licence, Special Licence and Secure Access NTS data\\nThe UK Data Archive also holds End User Licence (EUL) NTS data from 1972 onwards (see SNs 2852, 2853, 2855, 3288, 4108, 4583-4585, 6108 and 5340) and Special Licence (SL) NTS data from 1995 onwards (SNs 7804 and 7553). The EUL versions contain a comprehensive range of NTS data at Government Office Region geographic level and should be sufficient for most research needs. The SL versions contain more detailed travel (including accidents), demographic and socio-economic data, and the geographic level is Local Authority/Unitary Authority. These data are subject to more restricted access conditions than EUL. The Secure Access version  contains more detailed information and postcode sector geographies. Secure Access data are subject to further restricted access conditions, including the completion of a training course. For full details of the differences between the EUL, SL and Secure Access NTS, see the document '7559_nts_table_structures.xls' in the documentation. Users should always check whether the EUL and SL versions are suitable for their research needs before considering making an application for the Secure Access version.\\n\\n2020 and 2021 Disclaimer: Due to changes in the methodology of data collection, changes in travel behaviour and a reduction of data collected during 2020 and 2021, as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, care should be taken when interpreting this data and comparing to other years, due to the small sample sizes.

The first NTS was commissioned by the Ministry of Transport in 1965. Further periodic surveys were carried out in 1972/73, 1975/76, 1978/79 and 1985/86 (the UK Data Service holds End User Licence data from 1972 onwards and Special Licence and Secure Access data from 2002). Since July 1988 the NTS has been carried out as a continuous survey with field work being carried out in every month of the year, and an annual set sample of over 5,000 addresses. From 2002, the NTS sample was increased approximately threefold, to approximately 15,000 per year. The advantage of the continuous study is that users will be able to discern seasonal and cyclical movements as well as trend changes over time. The NTS is carried out primarily for the purposes of government. The most fundamental use of the National Travel Survey within the Department for Transport (DfT) is as core base data for key transport models. These are critical to the assessment and appraisal of transport scheme proposals (national and local), transport policy proposals, and contribute to the development of our long-term strategy. The NTS data is used to develop consistent sets of transport policies. Because it relates travel to travellers, it makes it possible to relate policies to people and to predict their impact. The survey provides detailed information on different types of travel: where people travel from and to, distance, purpose and mode. The NTS records personal and socio-economic information to distinguish between different types of people, and the differences in the way they travel and how often they do so. The NTS is the only source of national information on subjects such as walking which provide a context for the results of more local studies.\n\nFurther information may be found on the gov.uk National Travel Survey web page.\n\nEnd-User Licence, Special Licence and Secure Access NTS data\nThe UK Data Archive also holds End User Licence (EUL) NTS data from 1972 onwards (see SNs 2852, 2853, 2855, 3288, 4108, 4583-4585, 6108 and 5340) and Special Licence (SL) NTS data from 1995 onwards (SNs 7804 and 7553). The EUL versions contain a comprehensive range of NTS data at Government Office Region geographic level and should be sufficient for most research needs. The SL versions contain more detailed travel (including accidents), demographic and socio-economic data, and the geographic level is Local Authority/Unitary Authority. These data are subject to more restricted access conditions than EUL. The Secure Access version  contains more detailed information and postcode sector geographies. Secure Access data are subject to further restricted access conditions, including the completion of a training course. For full details of the differences between the EUL, SL and Secure Access NTS, see the document '7559_nts_table_structures.xls' in the documentation. Users should always check whether the EUL and SL versions are suitable for their research needs before considering making an application for the Secure Access version.\n\n2020 and 2021 Disclaimer: Due to changes in the methodology of data collection, changes in travel behaviour and a reduction of data collected during 2020 and 2021, as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, care should be taken when interpreting this data and comparing to other years, due to the small sample sizes.
