The first NTS was commissioned by the Ministry of Transport in 1965. Further periodic surveys were carried out in 1972/73, 1975/76, 1978/79 and 1985/86 (the UK Data Service holds End-User Licence data from 1972 onwards and Special Licence and Secure Access data from 2002 onwards). Since July 1988 the NTS has been carried out as a continuous survey with field work being carried out in every month of the year, and an annual set sample of over 5,000 addresses. From 2002, the NTS sample was increased approximately threefold, to approximately 15,000 per year. The advantage of the continuous study is that users will be able to discern seasonal and cyclical movements as well as trend changes over time. The NTS is carried out primarily for the purposes of government. The most fundamental use of the National Travel Survey within the Department for Transport (DfT) is as core base data for key transport models. These are critical to the assessment and appraisal of transport scheme proposals (national and local), transport policy proposals, and contribute to the development of our long-term strategy. The NTS data is used to develop consistent sets of transport policies. Because it relates travel to travellers, it makes it possible to relate policies to people and to predict their impact. The survey provides detailed information on different types of travel: where people travel from and to, distance, purpose and mode. The NTS records personal and socio-economic information to distinguish between different types of people, and the differences in the way they travel and how often they do so. The NTS is the only source of national information on subjects such as walking which provide a context for the results of more local studies.

Further information may be found on the gov.uk National Travel Survey webpage.

End-User Licence, Special Licence and Secure Access NTS data
The UK Data Archive holds three versions of the NTS:the End User Licence (EUL) versions (SNs 5340 and 6108) contain a comprehensive range of NTS data at Government Office Region geographic level and should be sufficient for most research needs. EUL data are available to registered users of the UK Data Service (see the Administrative and Access section below for details).The Special Licence versions (SNs 7553 and 7804) contain more detailed travel (including accidents), demographic and socio-economic data, and the geographic level is Local Authority/Unitary Authority. Special Licence data are subject to more restricted access conditions.The Secure Access version (SN 7559) contains more detailed information and postcode sector geographies. Secure Access data are subject to further restricted access conditions, including the completion of a training course.Full information about the variables contained at each level are available in the NTS Table Structures spreadsheet, available in the documentation.

2020 and 2021 Disclaimer: Due to changes in the methodology of data collection, changes in travel behaviour and a reduction of data collected during 2020 and 2021, as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, care should be taken when interpreting this data and comparing to other years, due to the small sample sizes. Please see the background documentation for further details of these changes.Latest edition information:For the thirteenth edition (September 2024), data and documentation for 2023 have been added to the study.Data labelsUsers should note that the SPSS and Stata files for 2023 have been converted from CSV format and do not currently contain variable or value labels. Complete metadata information can be found in the Excel Lookup table files and the NTS Data Extract User Guide within the documentation.
 The NTS data includes:

attitudinal variables: in 2016 a split-sample experiment was conducted to explore the feasibility of moving attitudinal questions from the household level questionnaire to the individual level questionnaire. In one half of the sample, the attitudinal questions were asked as part of the household questionnaire (as has been in the case in previous years) and in the other half one randomly selected adult per household was asked the attitudinal questions;household variables: address type information, accessibility of public transport, access to amenities, household vehicle access, household composition and household socio-economic information;individual information: age, gender and marital status, social and economic information, frequency of use of various methods of transport, driving licences and type of vehicle driven, employment, occupation and industry details, income, place of work and travel to work, season ticket details, travel difficulties;vehicle information: vehicle type, registration details, parking, fuel type, mileage, engine capacity;trips: day, date and time, main mode, purpose, origin and destination information;stage: mode, number in party, distance, duration, costs;long-distance trips (over 50 miles): stage: mode, purpose, origin and destination;

2002-2023: Special Licence Access\",\"description\":\"The National Travel Survey (NTS) is a series of household surveys designed to provide regular, up-to-date data on personal travel and monitor changes in travel behaviour over time. The first NTS was commissioned by the Ministry of Transport in 1965. Further periodic surveys were carried out in 1972/73, 1975/76, 1978/79 and 1985/86 (the UK Data Service holds End-User Licence data from 1972 onwards and Special Licence and Secure Access data from 2002 onwards). Since July 1988 the NTS has been carried out as a continuous survey with field work being carried out in every month of the year, and an annual set sample of over 5,000 addresses. From 2002, the NTS sample was increased approximately threefold, to approximately 15,000 per year. The advantage of the continuous study is that users will be able to discern seasonal and cyclical movements as well as trend changes over time. The NTS is carried out primarily for the purposes of government. The most fundamental use of the National Travel Survey within the Department for Transport (DfT) is as core base data for key transport models. These are critical to the assessment and appraisal of transport scheme proposals (national and local), transport policy proposals, and contribute to the development of our long-term strategy. The NTS data is used to develop consistent sets of transport policies. Because it relates travel to travellers, it makes it possible to relate policies to people and to predict their impact. The survey provides detailed information on different types of travel: where people travel from and to, distance, purpose and mode. The NTS records personal and socio-economic information to distinguish between different types of people, and the differences in the way they travel and how often they do so. The NTS is the only source of national information on subjects such as walking which provide a context for the results of more local studies.\\n\\nFurther information may be found on the gov.uk National Travel Survey webpage.\\n\\nEnd-User Licence, Special Licence and Secure Access NTS data\\nThe UK Data Archive holds three versions of the NTS:the End User Licence (EUL) versions (SNs 5340 and 6108) contain a comprehensive range of NTS data at Government Office Region geographic level and should be sufficient for most research needs. EUL data are available to registered users of the UK Data Service (see the Administrative and Access section below for details).The Special Licence versions (SNs 7553 and 7804) contain more detailed travel (including accidents), demographic and socio-economic data, and the geographic level is Local Authority/Unitary Authority. Special Licence data are subject to more restricted access conditions.The Secure Access version (SN 7559) contains more detailed information and postcode sector geographies. Secure Access data are subject to further restricted access conditions, including the completion of a training course.Full information about the variables contained at each level are available in the NTS Table Structures spreadsheet, available in the documentation.\\n\\n2020 and 2021 Disclaimer: Due to changes in the methodology of data collection, changes in travel behaviour and a reduction of data collected during 2020 and 2021, as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, care should be taken when interpreting this data and comparing to other years, due to the small sample sizes. Please see the background documentation for further details of these changes.Latest edition information:For the thirteenth edition (September 2024), data and documentation for 2023 have been added to the study.Data labelsUsers should note that the SPSS and Stata files for 2023 have been converted from CSV format and do not currently contain variable or value labels. Complete metadata information can be found in the Excel Lookup table files and the NTS Data Extract User Guide within the documentation.\\n The NTS data includes:\\n\\nattitudinal variables: in 2016 a split-sample experiment was conducted to explore the feasibility of moving attitudinal questions from the household level questionnaire to the individual level questionnaire. In one half of the sample, the attitudinal questions were asked as part of the household questionnaire (as has been in the case in previous years) and in the other half one randomly selected adult per household was asked the attitudinal questions;household variables: address type information, accessibility of public transport, access to amenities, household vehicle access, household composition and household socio-economic information;individual information: age, gender and marital status, social and economic information, frequency of use of various methods of transport, driving licences and type of vehicle driven, employment, occupation and industry details, income, place of work and travel to work, season ticket details, travel difficulties;vehicle information: vehicle type, registration details, parking, fuel type, mileage, engine capacity;trips: day, date and time, main mode, purpose, origin and destination information;stage: mode, number in party, distance, duration, costs;long-distance trips (over 50 miles): stage: mode, purpose, origin and destination;\\nPlease see the Lookup Tables documentation for the full list of variables.\",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/national-travel-survey-2002-2023-special-licence-access\",\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-7553-13\"],\"keywords\":[],\"creator\":[{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"Department
