We considered this in four distinct phases. The first simply looked at the control of unobstructed walking in this population. The grant then moved on to look at the negotiation of obstacles, specifically how individuals walk through narrow gaps or apertures. In phase two we considered the visual judgements of individuals when deciding whether they were able to pass through a narrow gap or not. In phase 3, we asked participants to actually pass through these same narrow gaps / apertures and we measured their movements. Finally in phase 4 we considered negotiation of unexpected obstacles, as participants walked a ‘gate’ might or might not close in their pathway.\n\nFor this series of studies we used the same participants with and without DCD. This consisted of a group of 44 participants with DCD aged from 7 years to 32 years and a group of age (within 6 months) and gender matched typically developing participants. Participants with DCD were selected in line with DSM 5 criteria. More detailed information about each participant can be found within each datasheet.\n\nSome of the data has an embargo due to forthcoming publications – however, it will all be available from 01.01.17\n\nThis entry refers to Phase 3 negotiating apertures in children\n\nDatasheets from the other phases are as follows:\nPhase 1: Navigational abilities in individuals with and without Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD); Phase 1: Flat walking (this is the data for all of the participants)\nPhase 2: Navigational abilities in individuals with and without Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD): Phase 2 visual judgements of size (this is the data for all of the participants)\nPhase 3: (two files)\nNavigational abilities in individuals with and without Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD); Phase 3: Negotiating obstacles in children with DCD (this is the data for the 7-17 year olds)\nNavigational abilities of typically developing individuals and individuals with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD): Phase 3 adult data (this is the data for the 18-32 year-olds)\nPhase 4: \nNavigational abilities in individuals with and without Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD); Phase 4: Unexpected obstacle avoidance typical adults (this is a data set of typical adults only)\nDuring everyday life we walk around busy environments, negotiating stationary and moving obstacles.

Phase 2: Navigational abilities in individuals with and without Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD): Phase 2 visual judgements of size (this is the data for all of the participants)
Phase 3: (two files)
Navigational abilities in individuals with and without Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD); Phase 3: Negotiating obstacles in children with DCD (this is the data for the 7-17 year olds)
Navigational abilities of typically developing individuals and individuals with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD): Phase 3 adult data (this is the data for the 18-32 year-olds)
Phase 4: 
Navigational abilities in individuals with and without Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD); Phase 4: Unexpected obstacle avoidance typical adults (this is a data set of typical adults only)
During everyday life we walk around busy environments, negotiating stationary and moving obstacles. This is usually performed effortlessly but actually involves complex skills to visually monitor the environment and control body movements. For individuals with coordination difficulties this presents a real challenge and can have a negative impact on safe participation at school or work and in everyday life.

This project will consider several aspects of obstacle avoidance and navigation in children and adults with and without Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). DCD is characterized by everyday motor problems in the absence of sensory, intellectual or neurological impairment. The condition occurs in almost 2% of children and usually continues into adulthood.

Primarily the project will focus on locomotion while negotiating a gap/aperture between obstacles such as that created by a doorway or parked cars. Such a task has both a perceptual element and a motor element. We plan to consider the perceptual element both in isolation and within a movement context. Finally the project will consider navigation of unpredictable or changing environments.
The proposed research will further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying DCD and thereby assist in planning more effective interventions to support motor learning.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Navigational abilities in individuals with and without Developmental Coordination Disorder(DCD), Phase 3: Negotiating obstacles in children with DCD"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Navigational abilities in individuals with and without Developmental Coordination Disorder(DCD), Phase 3: Negotiating obstacles in children with DCD"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/navigational-abilities-in-individuals-with-and-without-developmental-coordination-disorder-dcd-phase-3-negotiating-obstacles-in-children-with-dcd"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Navigational abilities in individuals with and without Developmental Coordination Disorder(DCD), Phase 3: Negotiating obstacles in children with DCD"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Navigational abilities in individuals with and without Developmental Coordination Disorder(DCD), Phase 3: Negotiating obstacles in children with DCD"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
