1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS) follows the lives of 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1958.\n\nThe National Child Development Study started in 1958 as the Perinatal Mortality Survey. Sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund, the survey was designed to examine the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy among the children born in Great Britain.\n\nBy collecting information on various aspects of life, the NCDS has become an invaluable data source on such diverse topics as effects of socioeconomic circumstances on health, social mobility and changes in social attitudes. Today, the 1958 cohort is one of the best resources for understanding how retirement and ageing are changing in Britain.\n\nWith quantitative and qualitative, social and biomedical data, the 1958 cohort is a leading resource for both policy development and best practice in longitudinal research.\n\nStudy website: www.cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1958-national-child-development-study/"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"a:[[\"$\",\"$L12\",null,{\"strategy\":\"beforeInteractive\",\"id\":\"structured-data\",\"type\":\"application/ld+json\",\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"{\\\"@context\\\":\\\"https://schema.org/\\\",\\\"@type\\\":\\\"Dataset\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"NCDS Biomedical Interview (2002) Dataset\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"NCDS Biomedical Interview (2002) Dataset\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/ncds-biomedical-interview-2002-dataset\\\",\\\"identifier\\\":[],\\\"keywords\\\":[\\\"Cognitive measures\\\",\\\"Victimisation and life events\\\",\\\"Social care - need\\\",\\\"Political and social attitudes\\\",\\\"Biomarkers\\\",\\\"Parenting and family\\\",\\\"Sexuality and gender identity\\\",\\\"Loneliness and social isolation\\\",\\\"Work and employment\\\",\\\"Social care - provision\\\",\\\"Socioeconomic status and deprivation\\\",\\\"Reproductive health\\\",\\\"Education\\\",\\\"Housing\\\",\\\"Migration and immigration\\\",\\\"Sleep problems\\\",\\\"Social care - receipt\\\",\\\"Covid-19 data collection\\\",\\\"Language and literacy\\\",\\\"Diet and nutrition\\\",\\\"Physical health assessment\\\"]}\"}}],[\"$\",\"$L13\",null,{\"study\":{\"dataset_schema\":{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Dataset\",\"name\":\"NCDS Biomedical Interview (2002) Dataset\",\"description\":\"NCDS Biomedical Interview (2002) Dataset\",\"url\":[\"https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.cls.ncds/c244ad4f-d166-464c-945e-3eac43afa805\"],\"keywords\":[\"Cognitive measures\",\"Victimisation and life events\",\"Social care - need\",\"Political and social attitudes\",\"Biomarkers\",\"Parenting and family\",\"Sexuality and gender identity\",\"Loneliness and social isolation\",\"Work and employment\",\"Social care - provision\",\"Socioeconomic status and deprivation\",\"Reproductive health\",\"Education\",\"Housing\",\"Migration and immigration\",\"Sleep problems\",\"Social care - receipt\",\"Covid-19 data collection\",\"Language and literacy\",\"Diet and nutrition\",\"Physical health assessment\"],\"identifier\":[],\"variableMeasured\":[{\"name\":\"N622\",\"description\":\"Sex of Cohort Member\"},{\"name\":\"PAGE\",\"description\":\"Age last birthday\"},{\"name\":\"BDMBL\",\"description\":\"Blind (from sample data)\"},{\"name\":\"BDMPS\",\"description\":\"Partially sighted (from sample data)\"},{\"name\":\"BDMDF\",\"description\":\"Deaf (from sample data)\"},{\"name\":\"BDMHR\",\"description\":\"Hearing problems (from sample data)\"},{\"name\":\"BDMPH\",\"description\":\"Physically disabled (from sample data)\"},{\"name\":\"BDMSP\",\"description\":\"Speech difficulty (from sample data)\"},{\"name\":\"DMHT\",\"description\":\"Height measured at age 33\"},{\"name\":\"DMRE\",\"description\":\"Reading difficulty (from sample data)\"},{\"name\":\"MEASQ\",\"description\":\"Before we start the medical measurements, I would like to check that you have read the information which was sent to you in advance.
