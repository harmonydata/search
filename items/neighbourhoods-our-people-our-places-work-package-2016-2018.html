The research was intended to inform commitments set out in the Prime Minister’s Challenge on Dementia (DoH 2012) which included plans to develop a nationwide network of dementia friendly communities. The project built on a pilot study involving 14 carers of people with dementia, conducted in the north-west of England during 2011 (Ward et al 2012). This allowed us to test the feasibility and refine the design in collaboration with stakeholders using workshops that included people with dementia, carers, practitioners, service commissioners and local policymakers. Design and methodology: The main aim was to investigate how neighbourhoods and local communities can support people living with dementia to remain socially and physically active. Working within a social constructionist paradigm, we used qualitative methods framed by a longitudinal and comparative design. The project extended over three fieldsites: Greater Manchester in northern England; the Central Belt of Scotland; and the county of Östergötland in the south of Sweden. Each fieldsite incorporated a research phase followed by planning and development for a neighbourhood-based intervention.Dementia is often presented as a global issue with substantial economic consequences for all countries and societies providing diagnostic and/or supportive services. Whilst we believe this is necessary and important information, in our 5-year study we want to celebrate the achievements, growth and contribution that people with dementia and their carers make to society. To do this, we are putting the local neighbourhood and networks in which people with dementia and their carers live and belong at the centre of our work. We have designed a study on neighbourhood living that has 4 inter-linked work packages (WPs), an international partner , the Center for Dementia Research [CEDER] at Linköping University, Sweden, and strong user involvement through the EDUCATE and Open Doors groups [Greater Manchester, England]; The ACE Club [Rhyl, North Wales]; and the Scottish Dementia Working Group [Glasgow, Scotland]. In the UK our academic partners are situated in Manchester, Salford, Stirling, Liverpool and London and we have third sector involvement through the Deaf Heritage Project at the British Deaf Association, as well as a range of project partners which includes the North West People in Research Forum, the Citizen Scientist initiative and a Community Integrated Company that supports people with dementia through accessible technology [Finerday]. As this is a complex set of networks based around a neighbourhoods theme, each WP will use different research methods and partners to meet their primary aims and objectives. WP1 is a secondary analysis of the English Longitudinal Study of Aging database which will compile Neighbourhood Profiles that will be available for the whole country; these Profiles will include information on cognitive risk factors and clusters of population; WP2 will develop a set of core outcomes measures in dementia that will involve people with dementia and their carers in deciding what measures and priorities are important for them; WP3 will explore what makes a dementia friendly neighbourhood and will take place in Stirling, Salford and Linköping; WP4 has 3 interventions representing various stages of the Medical Research Council&#x27;s complex interventions framework. Intervention 1 will be a full RCT of an educational intervention for general hospitals that several members of the project team have developed and piloted over the last 2 years. In this study, we want to find out if the educational intervention results in people with dementia leaving hospital for their neighbourhood home sooner, but with high levels of satisfaction. Interventions 2 and 3 are pilot trials. Intervention 2 will be conducted in Sweden and Manchester, UK and will use technology to help couples, where one person has a dementia, to better self-manage the condition and, more importantly, their relationship. In intervention 3, we are looking at the diversity of a neighbourhood and will develop the first digitalised life story intervention in the world for Deaf people (BSL users) who live with dementia. This will be the first intervention for this group in the world. In this programme of work we will develop a user research programme as some people with dementia have told us that they would like to work alongside the research team as co-researchers."/><meta property="og:title" content="Neighbourhoods: Our People, Our Places Work Package, 2016-2018"/><meta property="og:description" content="The ‘Neighbourhoods: our people, our places study’ (2014 – 2019) was undertaken as part of a wider programme of research exploring dementia in a neighbourhood context (Keady 2014).

Our People, Our Places Work Package, 2016-2018\",\"description\":\"The ‘Neighbourhoods: our people, our places study’ (2014 – 2019) was undertaken as part of a wider programme of research exploring dementia in a neighbourhood context (Keady 2014). The research was intended to inform commitments set out in the Prime Minister’s Challenge on Dementia (DoH 2012) which included plans to develop a nationwide network of dementia friendly communities. The project built on a pilot study involving 14 carers of people with dementia, conducted in the north-west of England during 2011 (Ward et al 2012). This allowed us to test the feasibility and refine the design in collaboration with stakeholders using workshops that included people with dementia, carers, practitioners, service commissioners and local policymakers. Design and methodology: The main aim was to investigate how neighbourhoods and local communities can support people living with dementia to remain socially and physically active. Working within a social constructionist paradigm, we used qualitative methods framed by a longitudinal and comparative design. The project extended over three fieldsites: Greater Manchester in northern England; the Central Belt of Scotland; and the county of Östergötland in the south of Sweden. Each fieldsite incorporated a research phase followed by planning and development for a neighbourhood-based intervention.Dementia is often presented as a global issue with substantial economic consequences for all countries and societies providing diagnostic and/or supportive services. Whilst we believe this is necessary and important information, in our 5-year study we want to celebrate the achievements, growth and contribution that people with dementia and their carers make to society. To do this, we are putting the local neighbourhood and networks in which people with dementia and their carers live and belong at the centre of our work. We have designed a study on neighbourhood living that has 4 inter-linked work packages (WPs), an international partner , the Center for Dementia Research [CEDER] at Linköping University, Sweden, and strong user involvement through the EDUCATE and Open Doors groups [Greater Manchester, England]; The ACE Club [Rhyl, North Wales]; and the Scottish Dementia Working Group [Glasgow, Scotland]. In the UK our academic partners are situated in Manchester, Salford, Stirling, Liverpool and London and we have third sector involvement through the Deaf Heritage Project at the British Deaf Association, as well as a range of project partners which includes the North West People in Research Forum, the Citizen Scientist initiative and a Community Integrated Company that supports people with dementia through accessible technology [Finerday]. As this is a complex set of networks based around a neighbourhoods theme, each WP will use different research methods and partners to meet their primary aims and objectives. WP1 is a secondary analysis of the English Longitudinal Study of Aging database which will compile Neighbourhood Profiles that will be available for the whole country; these Profiles will include information on cognitive risk factors and clusters of population; WP2 will develop a set of core outcomes measures in dementia that will involve people with dementia and their carers in deciding what measures and priorities are important for them; WP3 will explore what makes a dementia friendly neighbourhood and will take place in Stirling, Salford and Linköping; WP4 has 3 interventions representing various stages of the Medical Research Council's complex interventions framework. Intervention 1 will be a full RCT of an educational intervention for general hospitals that several members of the project team have developed and piloted over the last 2 years. In this study, we want to find out if the educational intervention results in people with dementia leaving hospital for their neighbourhood home sooner, but with high levels of satisfaction. Interventions 2 and 3 are pilot trials. Intervention 2 will be conducted in Sweden and Manchester, UK and will use technology to help couples, where one person has a dementia, to better self-manage the condition and, more importantly, their relationship. In intervention 3, we are looking at the diversity of a neighbourhood and will develop the first digitalised life story intervention in the world for Deaf people (BSL users) who live with dementia. This will be the first intervention for this group in the world. In this programme of work we will develop a user research programme as some people with dementia have told us that they would like to work alongside the research team as co-researchers.\",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/neighbourhoods-our-people-our-places-work-package-2016-2018\",\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-855969\"],\"keywords\":[\"DEMENTIA\",\"NEIGHBOURHOODS\",\"SOCIAL CARE\",\"ENVIRONMENT\"],\"temporalCoverage\":\"2016-01-01/2018-12-01\"}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"17:T1225,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"The ‘Neighbourhoods: our people, our places study’ (2014 – 2019) was undertaken as part of a wider programme of research exploring dementia in a neighbourhood context (Keady 2014).
