We will do this by comparing commonly used identification parade procedures and manipulating components of each procedure to investigate the factors that increase discriminability. The results of the experiments will shed light on why certain identification parade procedures (e.g., sequentially presented videos vs. simultaneously presented videos) and components of those procedures (e.g., identifications made quickly, number of individuals presented in an identification parade) increase discriminability. The results of this research could ultimately lead to more guilty people and fewer innocent people being identified and later prosecuted. Thus, the proposed research has the potential to make significant societal impact.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"New ways to improve eyewitness identifications using receiver operating characteristics analysis 2015-2018"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"New ways to improve eyewitness identifications using receiver operating characteristics analysis 2015-2018"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/new-ways-to-improve-eyewitness-identifications-using-receiver-operating-characteristics-analysis-2015-2018"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"New ways to improve eyewitness identifications using receiver operating characteristics analysis 2015-2018"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"New ways to improve eyewitness identifications using receiver operating characteristics analysis 2015-2018"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
