The surveys are, therefore, very specific in nature and the subjects covered diverse. The Data Archive holds 19 such surveys.
Readers are asked to note that, with the exception of the surveys on the Telephone Service - 69004, 69016, respondents surveyed are self selected from subscribers to the Association&#x27;s magazine &lt;i&gt;Which?&lt;/i&gt; and so the surveys cannot singly be used in descriptive accounts of the British public.
Surveys 69005-69012 cover various aspects of the housing experiences of &lt;i&gt;Which?&lt;/i&gt; readers who moved house in 1967 and 1968. It is here particularly important to remember that the choice strategies and the resources of &lt;i&gt;Which?&lt;/i&gt; readers are unlikely to be typical.  Data include: identity of designer/builder (6 categories); builder/developer&#x27;s asking price and price actually paid for property; whether respondent negotiated directly with builder/developer; date of signing contract; whether property was newly built or a conversion of an older property; whether respondent agreed to buy property before it was finished (if yes, amount of contact she had with builder/construction site is noted); whether property was ready by promised date of completion (details of delays are given); finally, whether property had an NHBRC or other guarantee (details recorded) and whether this was of any use.
Building defects: respondents are given definitions of `minor defects&#x27; (i.e. less than 15 pounds worth) and serious defects (i.e. more than 15 pounds worth). 14 Classifications of possible defects are listed (e.g. site clearance, plumbing, roofing etc.) and respondents are asked to describe defects (employing the above definitions) in the appropriate category (stating number of defects, standard of repair etc.). Finally, they are asked to give an overall assessment of the standard of work and repair carried out by a) main contractor and b) sub-contractors.
Background Variables
Region, type of area (e.g. urban, rural etc.), description of property (e.g. detached house/cottage), whether freehold, rented or leased; type of fuel supplied and heating used (and whether respondent had a choice). Details of accommodation are given (e.g. number of rooms, number of floors, sufficiency of storage space, floor area etc.)."/><meta property="og:title" content="Newly Built Homes, 1969"/><meta property="og:description" content="Data accumulated from Consumers&#x27; Association surveys are designed to be used by the consumer.
