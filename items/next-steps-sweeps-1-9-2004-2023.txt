Latest edition informationFor the eighteenth edition (February 2025), the Sweep 9 Derived Variables data file has been updated with some newly derived variables categorised under the household (W9DCHNO12, W9DTOTCH, W9DTOTOWNCH) and education (W9DAQLVLH, W9DVQLVLH) sections. The Longitudinal data file have been updated with changes to the weight variables. Three out of the four weights in the previous version have been removed. W9FINWTALLB has been renamed to W9FINWT in line with previous sweeps. The user guide has been updated to reflect these changes. Furthermore, the derived variables user guide has been merged into the main user guide and can be accessed via Appendix 1.

The study mainly focused on the educational and early labour market experiences of young people.In 2015 Next Steps was restarted, under the management of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) at the UCL Faculty of Education and Society (IOE) and funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. The Next Steps Age 25 survey was aimed at increasing the understanding of the lives of young adults growing up today and the transitions out of education and into early adult life.The Next Steps Age 32 Survey took place between April 2022 and September 2023 and is the ninth sweep of the study. The Age 32 Survey aimed to provide data for research and policy on the lives of this generation of adults in their early 30s. This sweep also collected information on many wider aspects of cohort members' lives including health and wellbeing, politics and social participation, identity and attitudes as well as capturing personality, resilience, working memory and financial literacy. Next Steps survey data is also linked to the National Pupil Database (NPD), the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the Individualised Learner Records (ILR) and the Student Loans Company (SLC).
