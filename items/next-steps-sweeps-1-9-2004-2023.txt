The study started in 2004 and was funded and managed by the Department for Education until it transferred to CLS in 2013. Annual interviews with study members were carried out between 2004 and 2010 (ages 14 to 20), as well as interviews with parents for the first four sweeps. The study focused primarily on educational transitions and was supplemented by linked administrative data from the National Pupil Database. Following the initial survey at age 13-14, the cohort members were interviewed every year until 2010.

In 2013 CLS successfully re-started the study and collected another sweep of data at age 25 (in 2015/2016). The scientific content of the study was broadened to provide a multidisciplinary research resource, supplemented by a wide-range of administrative data linkage consents. Extensive efforts were made to maximise the size and representativeness of the sample and interviews were achieved with almost 8,000 study members.
