The WVS is one of the world&#x27;s most extensive and most widely used social surveys. Since 1981, it has captured the views of almost 400,000 respondents in over 110 countries, covering topics including cultural identity, migration, trust, empathy, tolerance, media consumption, political interest, the environment and more.These surveys show pervasive changes in what people want out of life and what they believe. To monitor these changes, the EVS/WVS has executed seven waves of surveys to date at various times between 1981 and 2022. Representative national samples of each society&#x27;s public are interviewed using a standardised questionnaire covering various social, economic, cultural and religious topics. The countries included in these surveys cover the full range from very poor countries to very rich ones, from authoritarian systems to liberal democracies, covering all major cultural zones. 
Further information about each survey series can be found on the EVS and WVS websites.

 Background to the European Values Studies
The European Values Study (EVS) is a large-scale, cross-national and longitudinal survey of moral, religious, political and social values.  The project was designed to investigate the nature and inter-relationship of value systems, their degree of homogeneity, and the extent to which they are subject to change across time.
To date there have been 3 waves, the first carried out in 1981, the second in 1990 and the third in 1999/2000.
The 1981 survey was carried out in ten member states of the European Community. After the initial fieldwork the survey was carried out in a further 16 countires (Argentina, Australia, Chile, Canada, Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Japan, Malta, Mexico, Norway, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, United States and parts of the Soviet Union).
The 1990 survey was carried out in all European countries as well as the United States and Canada.The third EVS was carried out in Europe.

Northern Ireland European Values Survey, 1999
The aim of this study was the inclusion of Northern Ireland as a fully participant member of the 1999 European Values Study (EVS). The survey was carried out by means of face-to-face interviews with a sample of 1000 randomly-selected adults, representative of the adult population of Northern Ireland. The study was based on an adapted version of the 1999 wave of the EVS, which has now been completed in most countries of western and eastern Europe, including the Republic of Ireland. As in previous EVS studies, the core questions focus on values and attitudes in areas such as religion, ethics, politics, work motivation, family and life-style. In addition to these core elements, however, the Northern Ireland survey also included and additional range of items on aspects of culture and identity peculiar to the island of Ireland. For example, respondents in this survey and the Republic of Ireland EVS wave (not currently held at the UK Data Archive) were questioned about their views on various aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and about their attitudes to national identity. Special care was taken to ensure that these additional questions were relevant within and across the two societies.

These data are also included in European and World Values Survey Four-wave Integrated Data File, 1981-2004, which is available for online analysis and download. Please see SN: 5488 for details.


  Topics covered include attitudes to work, religion, social groups, local communities, environmental protection, voluntary organisations, government, politics and democracy, family and friends, life satisfaction, human needs, marriage, children, concerns over the troubled situation in Northern Ireland, paramilitary violence, the Good Friday Agreement, political developments and devolved government and associated views on national identity. A range of demographic information was also collected.

values and norms on a wide variety of topics and to monitor changes in values and attitudes across the globe. The WVS is one of the world's most extensive and most widely used social surveys. Since 1981, it has captured the views of almost 400,000 respondents in over 110 countries, covering topics including cultural identity, migration, trust, empathy, tolerance, media consumption, political interest, the environment and more.These surveys show pervasive changes in what people want out of life and what they believe. To monitor these changes, the EVS/WVS has executed seven waves of surveys to date at various times between 1981 and 2022. Representative national samples of each society's public are interviewed using a standardised questionnaire covering various social, economic, cultural and religious topics. The countries included in these surveys cover the full range from very poor countries to very rich ones, from authoritarian systems to liberal democracies, covering all major cultural zones. \\nFurther information about each survey series can be found on the EVS and WVS websites.\\n\\n Background to the European Values Studies\\nThe European Values Study (EVS) is a large-scale, cross-national and longitudinal survey of moral, religious, political and social values.  The project was designed to investigate the nature and inter-relationship of value systems, their degree of homogeneity, and the extent to which they are subject to change across time.\\nTo date there have been 3 waves, the first carried out in 1981, the second in 1990 and the third in 1999/2000.\\nThe 1981 survey was carried out in ten member states of the European Community.

The study was based on an adapted version of the 1999 wave of the EVS, which has now been completed in most countries of western and eastern Europe, including the Republic of Ireland.

In addition to these core elements, however, the Northern Ireland survey also included and additional range of items on aspects of culture and identity peculiar to the island of Ireland. For example, respondents in this survey and the Republic of Ireland EVS wave (not currently held at the UK Data Archive) were questioned about their views on various aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and about their attitudes to national identity.
