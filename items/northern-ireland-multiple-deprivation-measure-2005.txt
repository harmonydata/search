2d:Tc54,The Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Measures 2001, 2005 and 2010  show the spatial distribution of deprivation across Northern Ireland at the small area level. Information is provided for a number of different types or ‘domains’ of deprivation; income, employment, health, education, proximity to services, crime, living environment, and an overall measure encompassing all of the deprivation domains. Small areas are measured relative to each other from rank 1 (most deprived) to least deprived . A number of summary measures at higher geographies and population estimates for the small area geographies are also provided. 

The Deprivation Measures follow the domain methodology employed by Professor Mike Noble of the Social Disadvantage and Research Centre, University of Oxford. The domain methodology underpins the construction of the English, Welsh and Scottish deprivation measures.

Further information is available from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) Multiple Deprivation Measures web pages.
