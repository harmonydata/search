See documentation for further details.1d:T4ef,The coding of employment occupation data from the National Child Development Study (NCDS) and the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) was undertaken as part of the project An Examination of the Impact of Family Socio-economic Status on Outcomes in Late Childhood and Adolescence, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC).

Researchers from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), based at the University of Bristol, worked on data from selected waves of the NCDS and BCS70. To create occupational code classifications, the computerised questionnaire response text strings were converted into comma separated value (CSV) files and processed using the CASCOT (Computer Assisted Structured COding Tool) software programme, which used automatic and semi-automatic processing to assign Standard Occupational Classification 2000 (SOC2000) codes (SOC2000) to entries. For further details, see the documentation.

Information on the BCS70 and NCDS series may be found on the Institute of Education Centre for Longitudinal Studies website.

 The study comprises 12 data files, covering occupational coding across study waves for BCS70 and NCDS respondents and their mothers, fathers and partners.
