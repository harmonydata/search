2d:Tf57,The OECD Environment Statistics contains selected indicators for monitoring progress towards green growth to support policy making and inform the public at large. The dataset covers OECD countries as well as BRIICS economies, and selected countries when possible.

Within UKDS.Stat, the OECD Environment Statistics are presented in the following tables (some tables will include missing data):

Air and Climate

Emissions of air pollutants: This dataset presents trends in man-made emissions of major air pollutants by sources.

Greenhouse gas emissions: This dataset on air and climate presents trends in man-made emissions of major greenhouse gases and total emissions by gas and by source. 
Air Emission Accounts: This dataset presents total emissions of CO2 (CO2 emissions from energy use and industrial processes, e.g. cement production), CH4 (methane emissions from solid waste, livestock, mining of hard coal and lignite, rice paddies, agriculture and leaks from natural gas pipelines), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) for GHG and for other pollutants emissions data refer to emissions of sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane volatile organic compounds (VOC) and particulates (PM2.5).

Biodiversity

Threatened Species: This dataset on biodiversity shows numbers of known species and threatened species with the aim of indicating the state of mammals, birds, freshwater fish, reptiles, amphibians and vascular plants.

Expenditures and Revenues

Environmental protection expenditure and revenues: This dataset provides information on all purposeful activities directly aimed at the prevention, reduction and elimination of pollution or any other degradation of the environment resulting from production or consumption processes.

Forest

Depletion and growth of forest resources in terms of volume (thousand m3): This dataset presents data that help to trace net changes in terms of volume in the growing stock of standing wood on forest land.

Green Growth

Green Growth Indicators: This dataset contains selected indicators for monitoring progress towards green growth to support policy making and inform the public at large. The dataset covers OECD countries as well as BRIICS economies (Brazil, Russian Federation, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa), and selected countries when possible.

Land Resources

The data presented here give information concerning land use state and changes (e.g. agricultural land, forest land).

Material Resources

This dataset provides information on material resources, i.e. materials originating from natural resources that form the material basis of the economy: metals (ferrous, non-ferrous) non-metallic minerals (construction minerals, industrial minerals), biomass (wood, food) and fossil energy carriers.

Patents

This database provides the latest and most comprehensive statistics across OECD countries on patent-based innovation indicators that are suitable for tracking developments in environment-related technologies. The indicators allow the assessment of countries' and firms' innovative performance as well as the design of governments' environmental and innovation policies.

Policy Instruments

This dataset provides information on the instruments used for environmental policy (environmentally related taxes).

Waste

This dataset presents trends in amounts of municipal generated, and the treatment and disposal method used.

Water

This database provides the latest and most comprehensive statistics across OECD countries on water. Includes data on:

Wastewater treatment (% population connected)
Freshwater abstractions (million m3)
Freshwater resources (long term annual average, million m3)
Generation and discharge of wastewater (million m3)
Lake and river quality
