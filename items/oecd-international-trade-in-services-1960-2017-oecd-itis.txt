Trade in services: national classification items
This dataset contains additional national data on international trade in services for Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Turkey and the United States. The data are reported within the framework of the fifth and sixth editions of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual and the Extended Balance of Payments Services Classification (EBOPS 2002 and EBOPS 2010), which is consistent with the balance of payments classification but is more detailed. Series are shown in US dollars and are recorded from 1970 onwards. 

These data were first provided by the UK Data Service in November 2004.
