This dataset presents statistics on Indicators of international co-operation in patents (EPO, USPTO and PCT): where EPO stands for European Patent Office, USPTO for US Patent and Trademark Office and PCT for Patent Cooperation Treaty. Those indicators analyze to cross-border ownership of patents reflecting international flows of knowledge from the inventor country to the applicant countries and international flows of funds for research (multinational companies) and co-inventions representing the international collaboration in the inventive process. Data are divided in terms of Patent office and Triadic Patent families (application filed under EPO, patent grants at the USPTO, patent application filed under the PCT), type of international Cooperation in Patenting (foreign ownership, domestic ownership, percentage of patents invented abroad), reference date (application date, priority date, date of grant) and partner country. Data are presented as annual datapoints from 1976 onwards. The countries covered are Australia, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, United States and the European Union.

Patents by regions.

This dataset includes statistics on patent counts by regions where EPO and PCT filings are presented according to the region of the inventors/applicants residence (Territorial Level 3), including total patents and selected technology domains such as ICT, nanotechnology, biotechnology as well as environment-related technologies. Reference regions are available by inventor’s country of residence and applicant’s country of residents. Data are presented from 1978 onwards. The data covers some regions in Japan, Finland and Belgium.
