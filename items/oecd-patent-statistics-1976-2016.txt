Those indicators analyze to cross-border ownership of patents reflecting international flows of knowledge from the inventor country to the applicant countries and international flows of funds for research (multinational companies) and co-inventions representing the international collaboration in the inventive process. Data are divided in terms of Patent office and Triadic Patent families (application filed under EPO, patent grants at the USPTO, patent application filed under the PCT), type of international Cooperation in Patenting (foreign ownership, domestic ownership, percentage of patents invented abroad), reference date (application date, priority date, date of grant) and partner country. Data are presented as annual datapoints from 1976 onwards. The countries covered are Australia, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, United States and the European Union.
