This dataset comprises statistics pertaining to pensions indicators. It includes indicators such as occupational pension funds’ asset as a % of GDP, personal pension funds’ asset as a % of GDP, DC pension plans’ assets as a % of total assets. Pension fund and plan types are classified according to the OECD classification. Three dimensions cover this classification: pension plan type, definition type and contract type. The data runs from 1980 onwards. 

Public pension reserve funds' assets
This dataset covers both social security reserve funds and sovereign pension reserve funds, the two main categories of public pension reserve funds. Social security reserve funds are set up as part of the overall social security system. They are funded chiefly by surpluses from employee and/or employer contributions over current payouts and, in some cases, by top-up contributions from the government through fiscal transfers and other sources. Sovereign pension reserve funds are funds established by governments (independently of social security systems), who finance them directly through fiscal transfers. This table provided statistics on total asset, asset allocation, nominal net investment return, operating expenses and derivatives. Data are expressed in various measures such as stock and flow, data for asset classes are available in national currency million, nominal net investment returns are provided in percent, operating costs are expressed as a percent of total assets under management. The value of derivatives held is available in thousands of national currency. The data runs from 2000 onwards.
