It covers 37 countries (29 OECD countries and from 2005 Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Slovenia and from 2008 Bulgaria and Romania) for the period 2001-2008. The main social policy areas are as follows: taxes and social security contributions due on earnings and benefits, unemployment benefits, social assistance, family benefits, housing benefits, and in-work benefits. These social policies can be further examined by family type, number of children, first earner, second earner and employment status, 2007 edition of Benefits and Wages, statistics, country specific files and tax-benefit models and calculator, which provide detailed descriptions of all cash benefits available to those in and out of work as well as the taxes they were liable to pay are available on Benefits and Wages.

The countries covered are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, and United States.
