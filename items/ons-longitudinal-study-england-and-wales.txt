Examples include studies of mortality, cancer incidence and survival, and fertility patterns. The individual-level data of the LS means that person-years at risk can be calculated for epidemiological studies.

The ability to combine detailed personal characteristics with area characteristics has proved useful in many studies of health, for example, those looking at environmental effects on health, and those on inequalities in health.

Linked census data for members of the LS allow researchers to examine change between censuses by investigating the same people through two or more censuses. Studies of social mobility have examined changing class position by age. Information on co-residents of LS sample members has been used to study intergenerational mobility.

The size of the LS makes it suitable for the study of ageing. Studies have used the information collected on the co-residents and family status of LS sample members to examine changes to household and family arrangements that come with age.

Census forms ask about address one year ago. The linked census data in the LS have been used to study 10-year migration patterns between censuses. In addition, information on place of enumeration in 1939 has been used to study migration over longer periods.
