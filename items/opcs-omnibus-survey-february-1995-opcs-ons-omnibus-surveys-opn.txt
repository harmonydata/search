The idea is to have a set of measures of peoples' health plus their own assessment of how they regard their current situation. GHS measures have been added for comparison.
Pensions (Module 109): this module is concerned with the extent of knowledge that people have about pensions and the amount of provision that they have made.
Retirement Income (Module 110): this module asks questions about peoples' provision for retirement income; whether they think that they have adequate provision and whether they could afford to make extra contributions.19:T1179,The Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (formerly known as the ONS Opinions Survey or Omnibus) is an omnibus survey that began in 1990, collecting data on a range of subjects commissioned by both the ONS internally and external clients (limited to other government departments, charities, non-profit organisations and academia).Data are collected from one individual aged 16 or over, selected from each sampled private household. Personal data include data on the individual, their family, address, household, income and education, plus responses and opinions on a variety of subjects within commissioned modules.
The questionnaire collects timely data for research and policy analysis evaluation on the social impacts of recent topics of national importance, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the cost of living, on individuals and households in Great Britain.
From April 2018 to November 2019, the design of the OPN changed from face-to-face to a mixed-mode design (online first with telephone interviewing where necessary). Mixed-mode collection allows respondents to complete the survey more flexibly and provides a more cost-effective service for customers.
In March 2020, the OPN was adapted to become a weekly survey used to collect data on the social impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the lives of people of Great Britain. These data are held in the Secure Access study, SN 8635, ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, Covid-19 Module, 2020-2022: Secure Access. 
From August 2021, as coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions were lifting across Great Britain, the OPN moved to fortnightly data collection, sampling around 5,000 households in each survey wave to ensure the survey remains sustainable.
The OPN has since expanded to include questions on other topics of national importance, such as health and the cost of living. For more information about the survey and its methodology, see the ONS OPN Quality and Methodology Information webpage.Secure Access Opinions and Lifestyle Survey dataOther Secure Access OPN data cover modules run at various points from 1997-2019, on Census religion (SN 8078), cervical cancer screening (SN 8080), contact after separation (SN 8089), contraception (SN 8095), disability (SNs 8680 and 8096), general lifestyle (SN 8092), illness and activity (SN 8094), and non-resident parental contact (SN 8093). See Opinions and Lifestyle Survey: Secure Access for details. The non-core questions for this month were:
Mortgage Arrears (Module 2): source of mortgage, if any; whether behind in payments, and if so reasons for falling behind.  Also question on whether bought from a Right to Buy scheme.
Condom Use (Module 6): awareness of publicity about AIDS; use of condoms amongst the sexually active and its relation to publicity about HIV and AIDS.
Investment (Module 7a): ownership of shares and income from shares, bank accounts and building society accounts.
GP Accidents (Module 78): accidents in previous three months that resulted in seeing a doctor or going to hospital; where accident happened; whether saw a GP or went straight to hospital. For accidents involving either the respondent or other household member, that resulted in a GP being seen, details of items of equipment involved in the accident were recorded.
Children's Accounts (Module 102): the purpose of this module was to discover how much the public know about the registration of children's interest bearing bank and building society accounts so that tax is not deducted from the interest.
Consular Services (Module 104): this module was carried out to find out what expectations the public have of Consular services, and when they have used them what they thought of the service.
Health Status and Long-standing Illness (Module 105): the purpose of this module to is to test a selection of questions based on Euroqol, a standard set of questions used in a range of European countries. The idea is to have a set of measures of peoples' health plus their own assessment of how they regard their current situation. GHS measures have been added for comparison.
