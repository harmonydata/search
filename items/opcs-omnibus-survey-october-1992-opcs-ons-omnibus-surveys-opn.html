Personal data include data on the individual, their family, address, household, income and education, plus responses and opinions on a variety of subjects within commissioned modules.
The questionnaire collects timely data for research and policy analysis evaluation on the social impacts of recent topics of national importance, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the cost of living, on individuals and households in Great Britain.
From April 2018 to November 2019, the design of the OPN changed from face-to-face to a mixed-mode design (online first with telephone interviewing where necessary). Mixed-mode collection allows respondents to complete the survey more flexibly and provides a more cost-effective service for customers.
In March 2020, the OPN was adapted to become a weekly survey used to collect data on the social impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the lives of people of Great Britain. These data are held in the Secure Access study, SN 8635, ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, Covid-19 Module, 2020-2022: Secure Access. 
From August 2021, as coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions were lifting across Great Britain, the OPN moved to fortnightly data collection, sampling around 5,000 households in each survey wave to ensure the survey remains sustainable.
The OPN has since expanded to include questions on other topics of national importance, such as health and the cost of living. For more information about the survey and its methodology, see the ONS OPN Quality and Methodology Information webpage.Secure Access Opinions and Lifestyle Survey dataOther Secure Access OPN data cover modules run at various points from 1997-2019, on Census religion (SN 8078), cervical cancer screening (SN 8080), contact after separation (SN 8089), contraception (SN 8095), disability (SNs 8680 and 8096), general lifestyle (SN 8092), illness and activity (SN 8094), and non-resident parental contact (SN 8093). See Opinions and Lifestyle Survey: Secure Access for details. The non-core questions for this month were:
Company Cars (Module 1a): questions about the number of petrol-fuelled and diesel-fuelled company cars as well as total mileage and total business mileage; age of car, engine size and value of car when new.
Mortgage Arrears (Module 2): source of mortgage, if any, and whether behind in payments, and if so reasons for falling behind.  Also question on whether bought from a Right to Buy scheme. 
Health Screening (Module 4): whether prefer to have a health test carried out by pharmacist or by a doctor and reasons why; attitude to self-testing kits.
Investment (Module 7a): questions about investments in PEPs and TESSAs
Contraception (Module 6): method of birth control used and reasons for choice; changes in methods used; the use of Family Planning Clinics; awareness of emergency methods for use after intercourse has taken place.
Food Safety (Module 19): frequency of dining out; frequency and consumption of take-away meals and food; knowledge of possible dangers of eating certain foods or not preparing foods properly; ownership and use of refrigerator, freezer, microwave; knowledge of government health warnings on salmonella and listeria; awareness of food safety issues.
Melanoma (Module 49A,49B): knowledge of the term Melanoma and about the main signs of the disease.  Also attitudes to the exposure of children&#x27;s skin to the sun.
Medicines (Module 54): whether taken or given any medicines for digestive system diseases/problems; whether taken or been given any antibiotic medicines; names of medicines and days taken."/><meta property="og:title" content="OPCS Omnibus Survey, October 1992 / OPCS/ONS Omnibus Surveys; OPN"/><meta property="og:description" content="The Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (formerly known as the ONS Opinions Survey or Omnibus) is an omnibus survey that began in 1990, collecting data on a range of subjects commissioned by both the ONS internally and external clients (limited to other government departments, charities, non-profit organisations and academia).Data are collected from one individual aged 16 or over, selected from each sampled private household.
