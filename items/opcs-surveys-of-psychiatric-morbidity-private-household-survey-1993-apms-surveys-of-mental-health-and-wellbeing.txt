For 2007 and 2014, the surveys were conducted by NatCen Social Research on behalf of NHS Digital. The surveys capture information on common mental disorders, mental health treatment and service use, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorder, autism, personality disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, alcohol, drugs, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, self-harm, and comorbidity.Further information can be found on the NHS Digital Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys webpage.A similar series covering young people aged 5 to 15/16, the Mental Health of Children and Young People Surveys (MHCYP), is also commissioned by NHS Digital. 
 The purpose of the Private Household Survey was to provide good baseline information about mental illness in Britain to help in achieving <i>health of the nation</i> targets.  The survey aims were:
1. to estimate prevalence of psychiatric morbidity
2. to identify social disabilities associated with mental illness
3. to examine use of services and receipt of care in relation to diagnosis
4. to investigate recent stressful life events associated with mental illness
5. to look at co-morbidity between mental illness and physical illness and relationships with life-style indicators such as the use of drugs, tobacco, and alcohol.  All Respondents:
