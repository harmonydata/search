protection work 2017-2018
</title><meta name="description" content="This was an ethnographic study of social work organisations, how social workers and service users interact in child protection practice and the experiences of service users. Ethnographic data in the form of observations of social workers in their organisations and transcripts of observations of interactions between social workers and service users. Transcripts of interviews with social workers, managers and service users.  
The frequent disclosures that abused children who were known by professionals to be at serious risk have died and young people have experienced protracted sexual exploitation despite the involvement of social workers and other agencies is one of the most controversial and pressing social issues of our time. In recent times the names of children such as &#x27;Baby Peter&#x27; Connolly, Daniel Pelka, Hamza Khan and places such as Rochdale and Rotherham, have become synonymous with poor practice and scandal in child protection. By far the most popular explanation for why child protection failures occur is that social work is governed by a &#x27;rule of optimism&#x27;, where it is argued social workers put the best interpretation on events, avoid challenging parents and lose focus on the children (Coventry LCSB, 2013). These challenges and tragedies have invariably occurred in cases that were known to social workers for long periods of years and it is remarkable that little research has been carried out into why such failures to protect children occur in everyday practice, what the (optimistic?) outlook of practitioners is and the nature and quality of social work practice in long-term child protection work and what influences it. The aim of this study is to research what occurs in face to face practice encounters between social workers and children and families over the longer term (a period of 15 months) and examine the influence of different organizational structures and office designs and staff supervision on the nature and quality of the work. It will produce original data and theoretical insights on the relationship between organisational practices, staff supervision and how social workers relate to parents and help them to change, or not; and the dynamics of how some children become &#x27;invisible&#x27; in every day work as it unfolds in real time, while others are worked with effectively and kept safe. 
A range of methods will be used within an overall qualitative longitudinal research design. Participant observation will be undertaken of social workers&#x27; office routines, planning for home visits, journeys by foot and in the car to see families, their interactions with parents and children in their homes and elsewhere, and social workers&#x27; subsequent experiences of being supervised by managers. Observations and audio-recordings of the social worker-service user encounters (where informed consent has been given) and interviews with social workers and family members afterwards about their experiences will provide the basis for investigation of practitioners&#x27; thinking and lived experience, critical analysis of practice and organisational supports. Photographs and video tours of offices will be used (while maintaining the anonymity of participants and places) to achieve even greater depth in accessing the usually &#x27;invisible&#x27; dimensions of people&#x27;s lived experiences and the atmospheres and environments that influence the work. A practice framework for staff supervision and effective work with parents and children will be produced that incorporates: (1) how to engage and work with parents over time, including those who are resistant, and effect positive change; (2) how and where best to conduct assessments and long-term work with children; and (3) how to support staff to stay child-centred. The &#x27;rule of optimism&#x27; will be critically explored through theories that take understandings of practice beyond a simplistic focus on attitudes and &#x27;thinking&#x27; purely in terms of the cognitive, to focus on lived experiences, the senses and emotions and how practitioners&#x27; thinking is shaped by their bodies as well as minds (Ingold, 2011). Theoretical work previously developed by research team members on child protection as an embodied mobile practice (Ferguson 2011) and social workers&#x27; resilience, use of self and supervision (Davys and Beddoe, 2010) will be tested out and refined to produce further original theoretical insights and understandings of practice."/><meta property="og:title" content="Organisations, staff support and the dynamics and quality of social work practice: a qualitative longitudinal study of child

social work organisations, how social workers and service users interact in child protection practice and the experiences of service users. Ethnographic data in the form of observations of social workers in their organisations and transcripts of observations of interactions between social workers and service users. Transcripts of interviews with social workers, managers and service users.  \\nThe frequent disclosures that abused children who were known by professionals to be at serious risk have died and young people have experienced protracted sexual exploitation despite the involvement of social workers and other agencies is one of the most controversial and pressing social issues of our time. In recent times the names of children such as 'Baby Peter' Connolly, Daniel Pelka, Hamza Khan and places such as Rochdale and Rotherham, have become synonymous with poor practice and scandal in child protection. By far the most popular explanation for why child protection failures occur is that social work is governed by a 'rule of optimism', where it is argued social workers put the best interpretation on events, avoid challenging parents and lose focus on the children (Coventry LCSB, 2013). These challenges and tragedies have invariably occurred in cases that were known to social workers for long periods of years and it is remarkable that little research has been carried out into why such failures to protect children occur in everyday practice, what the (optimistic?) outlook of practitioners is and the nature and quality of social work practice in long-term child protection work and what influences it. The aim of this study is to research what occurs in face to face practice encounters between social workers and children and families over the longer term (a period of 15 months) and examine the influence of different organizational structures and office designs and staff supervision on the nature and quality of the work. It will produce original data and theoretical insights on the relationship between organisational practices, staff supervision and how social workers relate to parents and help them to change, or not; and the dynamics of how some children become 'invisible' in every day work as it unfolds in real time, while others are worked with effectively and kept safe. \\nA range of methods will be used within an overall qualitative longitudinal research design. Participant observation will be undertaken of social workers' office routines, planning for home visits, journeys by foot and in the car to see families, their interactions with parents and children in their homes and elsewhere, and social workers' subsequent experiences of being supervised by managers. Observations and audio-recordings of the social worker-service user encounters (where informed consent has been given) and interviews with social workers and family members afterwards about their experiences will provide the basis for investigation of practitioners' thinking and lived experience, critical analysis of practice and organisational supports. Photographs and video tours of offices will be used (while maintaining the anonymity of participants and places) to achieve even greater depth in accessing the usually 'invisible' dimensions of people's lived experiences and the atmospheres and environments that influence the work. A practice framework for staff supervision and effective work with parents and children will be produced that incorporates: (1) how to engage and work with parents over time, including those who are resistant, and effect positive change; (2) how and where best to conduct assessments and long-term work with children; and (3) how to support staff to stay child-centred. The 'rule of optimism' will be critically explored through theories that take understandings of practice beyond a simplistic focus on attitudes and 'thinking' purely in terms of the cognitive, to focus on lived experiences, the senses and emotions and how practitioners' thinking is shaped by their bodies as well as minds (Ingold, 2011). Theoretical work previously developed by research team members on child protection as an embodied mobile practice (Ferguson 2011) and social workers' resilience, use of self and supervision (Davys and Beddoe, 2010) will be tested out and refined to produce further original theoretical insights and understandings of practice.\",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/organisations-staff-support-and-the-dynamics-and-quality-of-social-work-practice-a-qualitative-longitudinal-study-of-child-protection-work-2017-2018\",\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-853630\"],\"keywords\":[\"ETHNOGRAPHY\",\"INTERVIEWS (DATA COLLECTION)\",\"OBSERVATION (DATA COLLECTION)\",\"CHILDREN\",\"SOCIAL WORKERS\"],\"temporalCoverage\":\"2017-08-01/2018-11-16\"}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"15:T113c,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"This was an ethnographic study of social work organisations, how social workers and service users interact in child protection practice and the experiences of service users.
