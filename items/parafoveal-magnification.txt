Releasing the constraints of visual acuity via PM allowed us to assess whether the attentional span in reading is equivalent to the “perceptual span” as assessed by prior experiments.  Finally, we repeated a set of sentences under normal and PM presentation conditions (normal-then-PM vs. PM-then- normal).  Experiment 2 investigated the parafoveal-on-foveal effect – in which the ease or difficulty in processing word n+1 is reflected in the fixation duration on word n.

This proposal devises a 'parafoveal magnification' paradigm. Text will be modified contingent on the position of the reader’s fixation location with parafoveal information enlarged, functionally equalising its perceptual impact with concurrent foveal information. Results will address whether the limits of the perceptual span are due to purely visual constraints of acuity or to attentional constraints of reading.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Parafoveal magnification"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Parafoveal magnification"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/parafoveal-magnification"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Parafoveal magnification"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Parafoveal magnification"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
