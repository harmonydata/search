Releasing the constraints of visual acuity via PM allowed us to assess whether the attentional span in reading is equivalent to the “perceptual span” as assessed by prior experiments.  Finally, we repeated a set of sentences under normal and PM presentation conditions (normal-then-PM vs. PM-then- normal).  Experiment 2 investigated the parafoveal-on-foveal effect – in which the ease or difficulty in processing word n+1 is reflected in the fixation duration on word n.
