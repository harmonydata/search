Participants downloaded a mobile phone app which asked them roughly three closed survey questions each day. Question topics included: lockdown, home learning (due to school closures), attitudes to vaccination, family life, home-school relationships etc. Demographic data were also collected from each participant including: their age, their gender, the number of children they have, the gender of their children, whether their child has a special educational need and whether their child is eligible to receive free school meals.

About Parent Ping Parent Ping was created by Education Intelligence, a company that since 2017 has run a daily survey app for teachers in England called Teacher Tapp. When schools closed for the majority of pupils during the 2020 covid pandemic there was a specific need to understand how parents were coping with home educating their children. Education Intelligence were able to secure a small grant from Big Change to replicate the software used to create Teacher Tapp in order to survey parents. The app they built was call Parent Ping.
