The 1993, 2002, 2009-2010 and 2019 surveys are currently held at the UK Data Service.
The aims of the Parental Rights Survey, 2019 (part of the Maternity and Paternity Rights series (MPRS)), were to:

Monitor take-up of maternity and paternity benefits and how this has changed;
Understand the impact of key legislative changes in parental rights since 2009-10, including the introduction of Shared Parental Leave and Pay (SPL and P) and rights for fathers and partners to attend antenatal appointments;
Examine the factors contributing to parents&#x27; decisions in this area and the factors that enable women to remain in work;
Explore parental attitudes towards childcare responsibility and how this has changed;
Provide a detailed, statistically representative, up-to-date picture of mothers&#x27; experiences and take-up of maternity rights and benefits;
Examine changes in mothers&#x27; engagement and experience in the labour market prior to, and following, the birth of their child;
Track changes (if any) for mothers since the 2009/10 survey;
Identify differences in take-up and eligibility across key demographic, socioeconomic and occupation groups, and how these have changed (if at all) since 2009/10; 
Provide a detailed, statistically representative and up-to-date picture of fathers&#x27; take-up of Paternity Leave and Paternity Pay in order to collect robust data on the various provisions for fathers during and after the mothers&#x27; pregnancies;
To track any changes (if any) for fathers since the 2009/10 survey;
To explore the attitudes of both mothers and fathers on sharing childcare responsibilities.
