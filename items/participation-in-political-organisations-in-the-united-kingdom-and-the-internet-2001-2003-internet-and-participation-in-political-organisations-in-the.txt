Objectives:
to develop established theoretical models of political participation by incorporating the role of technology in mobilising citizens;
to establish how far the internet is used by political organisations to promote political participation;

Implications:
theoretical: the research updates models of participation and democracy; and sheds more light on the social shaping vs. technological deterministic approaches;
empirical: an over time assessment of the attitudinal and behavioural orientation of the UK public towards electronic participation; a benchmark for assessing further innovations;

 The dataset contains material collected from different sources using a variety of methods. It is composed of five types of data: 

1) content analyses of the web sites of 29 political organisations, to assess the extent and nature of online participation, at four data points in the course of 18 months; 

2) email surveys of organisational elites and key IT personnel in the same organisation in order to gauge the attitude and importance of internet participation strategies, problems and benefits; 

3) semi-structured interviews with organisational elites in a sub-sample of the organisations most dependent on the internet, to understand internet participation strategies, problems and benefits; (Only three sample interviews were deposited)

4) membership surveys, both online and postal, with five political organisations (two parties, one trade union and two pressure groups), which gauge the levels of organisational participation and political participation by the respective members; 

5) an opinion survey of the British public, to evaluate citizen awareness and usage of the internet for political purposes and to gather a profile of users.
