For the first, main survey, data was collected by YouGov from 1,517 participants between 17th and 21st November 2017. Participants were identified through YouGov&#x27;s pre-existing panel of survey participants and were selected to produce a nationally representative sample for the UK population. This process involved panel members being sent a link to complete the survey. Only participants who answered all questions were included in the survey data. Participants who completed the questions in a time shorter than it would take to read the questions were excluded, resulting in a valid sample of 1,497 people (out of an initial sample of 1,517).
The first survey comes in 4 parts: 1- Attitudes to parties, 2- Views and desires for party representation, 3- Views and desires for party participation, 4- Views and desires for party governance.
A range of explanatory variables are also included for statistical analysis.
A second, shorter survey was fielded via YouGov on 8th-9th of April 2019, and gained 1,692 valid responses. This was composed of 10 questions that explored views of specific political parties. The link between citizens and the state is the crux of democratic politics, yet it is crumbling. Numerous studies have diagnosed a crisis in representative politics with decreased participation and growing levels of distrust bringing the legitimacy of democratic institutions into doubt. For many a solution has been offered by digital technology, leading parties to embrace new digital campaigning software. To explore the capacity of digital innovations to renew democracy this study argues that we need to understand the nature of the &#x27;disconnect&#x27; between parties and the people. 
 As such, this study departs from traditional analyses of &#x27;digital democracy&#x27; by focusing on public attitudes. Adapting the methodological approach used by Allen and Birch (2015) the project will discern how the public and parties conceive democratic linkage in practice and as an ideal, highlighting contradictions and convergence to diagnose the problem. Correlating these insights to the functions of digital software and theories of democratic linkage (Dalton, Farrell and McAllister, 2011) the capacity of digital innovations to renew party politics is considered.
 To enable analysis 3 work packages (WP) are conducted. WP1: How do parties perceive democratic linkage, and how have parties used digital management systems since 2010? WP1 will first identify available forms of the type of digital innovation of interest to this project - namely &#x27;digital management software&#x27; - and will categorise the functions they perform. Second, it will explore and develop theories of democratic linkage to provide a framework for subsequent analysis. Then, using interviews, internal party data and 3 case studies of constituency parties (1 from Labour, the Conservatives and Scottish National Party) the PI and RA will map perceptions of democratic linkage and usage of digital technology. This data will provide new insight on developments in party politics and will be used to produce case study accounts and articles that trace the form of change and consider the impact of digital technology on party organisation.
 WP2: How do citizens perceive democratic linkage, and how does parties&#x27; use of digital management systems affect public attitudes? WP 2 explores the impact of new technology. Working with YouGov the PI will commission 2 surveys. The first will assess public attitudes towards parties&#x27;, seeking to discern how the public want parties to engage and how they perceive this to work in practice. Data will be analysed to identify conceptions of democratic linkage (WP1) and then compared with party attitudes to identify synergies and incongruities in public and party conceptions. This analysis offers a diagnosis of the state of current linkage, and will identify areas of &#x27;disconnect&#x27; to be further examined in WP3. This WP will also probe public attitudes towards parties&#x27; use of digital campaigning techniques. Utilising a split sample survey, designed in collaboration with Dr Chris Jones, the PI will assess whether practices such as social media data mining are compatible with public notions of democratic linkage. This will inform an article, infographics and practitioner briefing papers. 
 WP3: Can digital campaigning methods resolve the disconnect between citizens and the state? In collaboration with the think tank Involve, the PI will use 3 deliberative events to explore parties&#x27; and citizens&#x27; attitudes towards democratic linkage and test the capacity of different forms of digital technology to reconcile these perceptions."/><meta property="og:title" content="Party survey and follow up survey 2017-2019"/><meta property="og:description" content="Two public opinion surveys were conducted.

21st November 2017. Participants were identified through YouGov's pre-existing panel of survey participants and were selected to produce a nationally representative sample for the UK population. This process involved panel members being sent a link to complete the survey. Only participants who answered all questions were included in the survey data. Participants who completed the questions in a time shorter than it would take to read the questions were excluded, resulting in a valid sample of 1,497 people (out of an initial sample of 1,517).\\nThe first survey comes in 4 parts: 1- Attitudes to parties, 2- Views and desires for party representation, 3- Views and desires for party participation, 4- Views and desires for party governance.\\nA range of explanatory variables are also included for statistical analysis.\\nA second, shorter survey was fielded via YouGov on 8th-9th of April 2019, and gained 1,692 valid responses. This was composed of 10 questions that explored views of specific political parties. The link between citizens and the state is the crux of democratic politics, yet it is crumbling. Numerous studies have diagnosed a crisis in representative politics with decreased participation and growing levels of distrust bringing the legitimacy of democratic institutions into doubt. For many a solution has been offered by digital technology, leading parties to embrace new digital campaigning software. To explore the capacity of digital innovations to renew democracy this study argues that we need to understand the nature of the 'disconnect' between parties and the people. \\n As such, this study departs from traditional analyses of 'digital democracy' by focusing on public attitudes. Adapting the methodological approach used by Allen and Birch (2015) the project will discern how the public and parties conceive democratic linkage in practice and as an ideal, highlighting contradictions and convergence to diagnose the problem. Correlating these insights to the functions of digital software and theories of democratic linkage (Dalton, Farrell and McAllister, 2011) the capacity of digital innovations to renew party politics is considered.\\n To enable analysis 3 work packages (WP) are conducted. WP1: How do parties perceive democratic linkage, and how have parties used digital management systems since 2010? WP1 will first identify available forms of the type of digital innovation of interest to this project - namely 'digital management software' - and will categorise the functions they perform. Second, it will explore and develop theories of democratic linkage to provide a framework for subsequent analysis. Then, using interviews, internal party data and 3 case studies of constituency parties (1 from Labour, the Conservatives and Scottish National Party) the PI and RA will map perceptions of democratic linkage and usage of digital technology. This data will provide new insight on developments in party politics and will be used to produce case study accounts and articles that trace the form of change and consider the impact of digital technology on party organisation.\\n WP2: How do citizens perceive democratic linkage, and how does parties' use of digital management systems affect public attitudes? WP 2 explores the impact of new technology. Working with YouGov the PI will commission 2 surveys. The first will assess public attitudes towards parties', seeking to discern how the public want parties to engage and how they perceive this to work in practice. Data will be analysed to identify conceptions of democratic linkage (WP1) and then compared with party attitudes to identify synergies and incongruities in public and party conceptions. This analysis offers a diagnosis of the state of current linkage, and will identify areas of 'disconnect' to be further examined in WP3. This WP will also probe public attitudes towards parties' use of digital campaigning techniques. Utilising a split sample survey, designed in collaboration with Dr Chris Jones, the PI will assess whether practices such as social media data mining are compatible with public notions of democratic linkage.
