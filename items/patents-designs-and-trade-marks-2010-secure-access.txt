The patent data include postcodes for a proportion of the applicants.  The trade mark data include the country of the proprietor.  The design data include no spatial units.For Secure Lab projects applying for access to this study as well as to SN 6697 Business Structure Database and/or SN 7683 Business Structure Database Longitudinal, only postcode-free versions of the data will be made available.
