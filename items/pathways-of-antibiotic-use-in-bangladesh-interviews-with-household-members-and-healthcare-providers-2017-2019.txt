Through in-depth interviews in urban and rural Bangladesh, we will gain a better understanding of behaviours around antibiotic prescribing and consumption as well as establishing whether there is an awareness of antibiotic resistance among healthcare practitioners, or their patients and clients. By interviewing practitioners across the whole range of formal and informal outlets we will assess the potential for practitioners to change prescribing practices or act as agents of change.  The findings will provide formative data on which to identify pathways for behaviour change.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Pathways of antibiotic use in Bangladesh: Interviews with household members and healthcare providers 2017-2019"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Pathways of antibiotic use in Bangladesh: Interviews with household members and healthcare providers 2017-2019"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/pathways-of-antibiotic-use-in-bangladesh-interviews-with-household-members-and-healthcare-providers-2017-2019"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Pathways of antibiotic use in Bangladesh: Interviews with household members and healthcare providers 2017-2019"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Pathways of antibiotic use in Bangladesh: Interviews with household members and healthcare providers 2017-2019"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
