This research seeks to:
•	advance an emerging pedagogical culture and content knowledge for social science research methods teaching;
•	create a typology of pedagogical approaches for social research methods teaching to inform national policy and practice;
•	develop a coherent theoretical framework for methods teaching to inform national practice.
 To this end, the project deploys four complementary components:
1) expert panel method, including interviews with a panel of international experts in research methods teaching and follow up focus groups with UK methods teachers;
2) diary methods and longitudinal analysis by and with researchers at different stages of doctoral and post-doctoral research careers about their methods learning experiences;
3) video-stimulated recall and reflection by researchers, teachers and learners in response to specific methods training events;
4) case studies of methodological and pedagogical innovation.
