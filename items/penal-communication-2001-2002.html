The penal communication research was carried out over a three year period. Its aim was to use the views of lay magistrates, probation staff, offenders and victims (the four research groups) to investigate normative questions raised by penal theorists. The study comprised the following stages:
stage 1: &#x27;Exploring Punishment as Communication&#x27;: first round interviews - 63 individuals were interviewed in total; 21 magistrates, 19 probation officers, 13 offenders and 10 victims;
stage 2: &#x27;Adding Quantitative Weight&#x27;: 771 questionnaires were completed by respondents drawn from the same four groups, but across five counties;
stage 3: Follow-up interviews: these were arranged with twelve individuals (three magistrates, three offenders, three victims and two probation officers) whose views reflected the range emerging from questionnaire analysis. In fact, eleven follow-up interviews were eventually conducted, as only two of the three interviews with &#x27;victims&#x27; took place. These follow-up interviews provided an opportunity to discuss specific questions raised in earlier analysis, using hypothetical examples to probe an issue in depth.

Data from all stages are included in the UK Data Archive (UKDA) collection. This mixed methods data collection includes both qualitative interview transcripts and a quantitative data file.

Topics covered in the qualitative interviews include the meaning of punishment, purpose of sentencing and punishment, probation, community service and combination orders, prison sentences, youth justice, public perceptions of sentencing, attitudes to criminal behaviour, reparation and restorative justice. In addition, the follow-up interviewees were asked to elaborate on responses they had given in the questionnaire.

The study comprised the following stages:\\nstage 1: 'Exploring Punishment as Communication': first round interviews - 63 individuals were interviewed in total; 21 magistrates, 19 probation officers, 13 offenders and 10 victims;\\nstage 2: 'Adding Quantitative Weight': 771 questionnaires were completed by respondents drawn from the same four groups, but across five counties;\\nstage 3: Follow-up interviews: these were arranged with twelve individuals (three magistrates, three offenders, three victims and two probation officers) whose views reflected the range emerging from questionnaire analysis. In fact, eleven follow-up interviews were eventually conducted, as only two of the three interviews with 'victims' took place.
