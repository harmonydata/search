Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
1. Staff (a distinction was made between staff teaching on degree courses and those on non-degree courses).
Reasons for teaching in a polytechnic, allocation of time between teaching, administration and research, attitude to CNAA degrees, evaluation of course taught - academic content, teaching and assessment methods, staff/student relationships. Evaluation of facilities, research involvement, membership of academic boards, contact with other polytechnics, universities, industry, research and professional organisations, attendance on outside courses, attitude to student involvement in administration and the planning and running of courses, opinion of polytechnic functions and future development, career expections.
2. Students (a distinction was made between students on degree courses, those on non-degree and part-time students).
Source of information about and reasons for choosing course and polytechnic, whether applied for university place (degree students only), post-school experience, evaluation of course - content, structure, teaching and assessment methods, student/staff relationships. Allocation of time between lectures, classes, group discussions and private study, evaluation of placement (sandwich students only), evaluation of facilities, society membership, contact with universities, other polytechnics, views on role and future development of polytechnics, career aspirations, preferred type of, and assessment of own accommodation, type of help polytechnic should provide, attitude to living at home and to student involvement in administration and the planning and running of courses.
3. Research Workers (a distinction was made between research assistants and research (postgraduate) students).
Source of information about and reasons for choosing post/course, evaluation of post/course, use and assessment of facilities, society membership, views on role and future development of polytechnics, career expectations.
