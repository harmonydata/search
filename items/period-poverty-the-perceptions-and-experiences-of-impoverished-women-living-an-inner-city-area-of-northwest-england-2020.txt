Unmet need and harm from poor menstrual health in low-and- middle-income countries have been documented, with little empirical research undertaken in high income countries. Continuing austerity in the UK suggests menstruators are likely more vulnerable to ‘period poverty’ than previously, with the COVID-19 pandemic assumed to exacerbate the situation. Aim To explore the menstrual experiences and perceptions of women in the UK who are living under circumstances of deprivation, alongside views of staff working in organisations supporting these women, to understand whether women’s menstrual needs are met. Methods A qualitative study was conducted in an inner-city in NW England. Three focus group discussions and 14 in-depth interviews were conducted across three study sites supporting impoverished women. Data was analysed thematically. Results Themes were: reflections on menstruation; affordability of products; access to public facilities; organisational support; potential solutions. Many women perceived menstruation as a burden in three aspects: physical discomfort and pain; psychological anxiety; and shame and stigma. Managing menstruation was difficult due to cost relative to low incomes, with food, heating and lighting prioritised, leaving women improvising with materials or wearing products for longer than desired. Most suggested that products should be free, often remarking if men required similar items this would happen. Most women were unaware supporting organisations provided free products. Staff felt the small range of products offered did not meet client needs and were ill prepared to have conversations on products and clients’ menstrual needs. Conclusion: Impoverished women lack the necessary resources to manage their menses well, which negatively impacts their health and brings stress, embarrassment, and shame. Support, including access to free products, is needed at both local and national level to help impoverished women manage their menstrual hygiene.The study aimed to explore the menstrual experiences and needs of women living in circumstances of deprivation together with staff from organisations supporting such women.\nA qualitative study was undertaken using focus group discussions (FGD) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) among staff and clients at 3 sites was undertaken.
