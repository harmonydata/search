The project examines how UK period poverty initiatives mitigated Covid-19 challenges in light of lockdown measures and closure of services, and how they continued to meet the needs of those experiencing period poverty across the UK. Applied social science research methodologies were utilised to collect and analyse data as this project, about the Covid-19 pandemic, was undertaken during an ongoing ‘real world’ pandemic. \nData collection was divided into two phases.  Phase 1 (October 2020 – February 2021) collected data from period poverty organisations in the UK using semi-structured interviews and an online survey to develop an in-depth understanding of how period poverty organisations  were responding to and navigating the Covid-19 Pandemic. Having collected and analysed this data, phase 2 (June  – September 2021) used an online survey to collect data from people experiencing period poverty in order to better understand their lived experiences during the pandemic. Our dataset comprises of phase 1 interview transcripts and online survey responses, and phase 2 online survey responses.Period poverty refers not only to economic hardship with accessing period products, but also to a poverty of education, resources, rights and freedom from stigma for girls and menstruators (1). Since March 2020, and the introduction of lockdown/social distancing measures as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 1 of every 10 girls (aged 14-21) cannot afford period products and instead must use makeshift products (toilet roll, socks/other fabric, newspaper/paper).

2d:Tc6e,This data was generated as part of an 18 month ESRC funded project,as part of UKRI’s rapid response to COVID-19.  The project examines how UK period poverty initiatives mitigated Covid-19 challenges in light of lockdown measures and closure of services, and how they continued to meet the needs of those experiencing period poverty across the UK. Applied social science research methodologies were utilised to collect and analyse data as this project, about the Covid-19 pandemic, was undertaken during an ongoing ‘real world’ pandemic. 
Data collection was divided into two phases.  Phase 1 (October 2020 – February 2021) collected data from period poverty organisations in the UK using semi-structured interviews and an online survey to develop an in-depth understanding of how period poverty organisations  were responding to and navigating the Covid-19 Pandemic. Having collected and analysed this data, phase 2 (June  – September 2021) used an online survey to collect data from people experiencing period poverty in order to better understand their lived experiences during the pandemic. Our dataset comprises of phase 1 interview transcripts and online survey responses, and phase 2 online survey responses.Period poverty refers not only to economic hardship with accessing period products, but also to a poverty of education, resources, rights and freedom from stigma for girls and menstruators (1). Since March 2020, and the introduction of lockdown/social distancing measures as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 1 of every 10 girls (aged 14-21) cannot afford period products and instead must use makeshift products (toilet roll, socks/other fabric, newspaper/paper). Nearly a quarter (22%) of those who can afford products struggle to access them, mostly because they cannot find them in the shops, or because their usual source/s is low on products/closed (2).

Community /non-profit initiatives face new challenges related to Covid-19 lockdown measures as they strive to continue to support those experiencing period poverty. Challenges include accessing stocks of period products, distribution of products given lockdown restrictions, availability of staff/volunteer assistance and the emergence of 'new' vulnerable groups. There is an urgent need to capture how initiatives are adapting to challenges, to continue to support the needs of those experiencing period poverty during the pandemic. This data is crucial to informing current practice, shaping policy, developing strategies within the ongoing crisis and any future crises, and ensuring women and girls' voices are centralised.

The project builds upon existing limited knowledge by providing insight into how UK based initiatives and projects are mitigating challenges linked to Covid-19, by examining how they are continuing to meet the needs of those experiencing period poverty and identifying any gaps in provision.
