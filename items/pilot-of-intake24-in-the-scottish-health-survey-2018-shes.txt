In 2018, Intake24, an online dietary recall system designed to collect detailed nutritional information over a 24-hour period, was piloted in the Scottish Health Survey (SHeS) (see SN 8569) with a view to including it in SHeS in the future.

This pilot was commissioned by Food Standards Scotland, in collaboration with the Scottish Government and delivered by ScotCen Social Research in partnership with Newcastle University’s Human Nutrition Research Centre and Open Lab who have developed and tested Intake24.
The aim of the pilot was to deliver a robust study to meet the following key objectives:




Measure response to Intake24 and examine the impact of response to the main survey.


Collect and assess feedback on Intake24 and its integration in SHeS from respondents and interviewers.


Determine the optimum approach for integrating Intake24 in SHeS and collecting two recalls from respondents.


Provide baseline dietary data for the Scottish population including analysis by health parameters (such as BMI) collected in SHeS allowing for comparison to the SDGs.


Allow comparison of dietary data from Intake24 and SHeS.
