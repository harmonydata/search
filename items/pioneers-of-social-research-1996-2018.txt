The data collection results from three grants since 2009; the first from the University of Essex, and the second two from The British Academy and the Leverhulme Trust respectively.17:T125c,This is a qualitative data collection. The Pioneers of Social Research collection includes the full interview transcripts, interview summaries, edited thematic highlights, short biographies and links to audio extracts from detailed life story interviews conducted with some fifty pioneers of social research.
Undertaken by pioneering oral historian, Paul Thompson and his colleagues, over a 20 year period (1996-2018) the interviews record the researcher’s own account of the influences which shaped the major phases of their research work, and how the research was carried out, including the problems encountered. The interviews begin with family background and education, in order to understand the key influences that originally shaped the researcher’s interests, and also include some brief account of later family life, but the focus is primarily on understanding the research work.
Because of their detail, these interviews are long, in Peter Townsend’s case extending to some twenty hours of recording. The material provides a valuable insight into their lives and careers and the trajectory of social research in some key disciplines in the social sciences.
