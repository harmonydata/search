We looked specifically at social practices within different households as this is a neglected but important site for managing waste. We explored social practices, perceptions, emotions, knowledge, and understandings of plastics packaging (recycling, repurposing, retaining, reusing, refusing). The interviews shed light on the value of plastics recycling which is understood widely but in practice the lived experience of plastics recycling is complex and frequently requires negotiating relationships. Ideas about classification systems and sorting differ considerably for cultural reasons; inter- generational perspectives on the value of plastics are also apparent and better understanding of these issues will help us shed light on the complex social context of circular economies.The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the problem of plastics in the environment, impacting on waste management across the UK, EU and globally. We have seen increased demand for single use plastics for public health purposes, disruptions to the usual distribution pathways and variations in reuse, recycle and retention which are all vital to developing a circular economy.

Implementation of this technology into the NextlooPP process will facilitate the availability of rPP granules for food, cosmetics and lower grade applications thus reducing the demand for virgin polymer. 

Tackling the systemic problem of plastic waste effectively cannot be achieved through purely technical means and our research offers fresh insights into people's perspectives on recycling and how consumers (UK, Spain, Germany) engage with surface markers on plastic packaging in their households, a neglected but important site for managing waste. This project thus moves beyond the technical infrastructure of waste management and design of products to address people's perceptions and behaviour with plastic packaging in their every day life and how their perceptions and behaviour might have changed in light of COVID-19.17:T125b,This dataset consists of 34 transcripts of semi-structured qualitative in-depth interviews with households in areas of 4 countries with high/low consumer recycling rates (England, Scotland, Spain, Germany). The aim was to explore how they engaged with the use and disposal of plastic packaging. We looked specifically at social practices within different households as this is a neglected but important site for managing waste. We explored social practices, perceptions, emotions, knowledge, and understandings of plastics packaging (recycling, repurposing, retaining, reusing, refusing). The interviews shed light on the value of plastics recycling which is understood widely but in practice the lived experience of plastics recycling is complex and frequently requires negotiating relationships. Ideas about classification systems and sorting differ considerably for cultural reasons; inter- generational perspectives on the value of plastics are also apparent and better understanding of these issues will help us shed light on the complex social context of circular economies.The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the problem of plastics in the environment, impacting on waste management across the UK, EU and globally. We have seen increased demand for single use plastics for public health purposes, disruptions to the usual distribution pathways and variations in reuse, recycle and retention which are all vital to developing a circular economy. As countries begin to ease lockdown restrictions it is likely that citizens will face greater pressures in managing their waste with potentially more home based working, less travel and socialising and increased single use plastic packaging (e.g. medical equipment, customer avoidance of 'loose' retail products).

An explosion of interest in the ongoing problem of plastic waste has seen a diverse range of solutions being proposed. Recently we completed the PRISM project (2015-18) with a number of industry leaders that has shown a real and sustainable proof of concept that promises to be a significant part of the solution to this problem.

We will address the automatic sorting of waste plastic containers used in food and non-food grade applications as is partially done at waste recycling plants. Current automated near infra-red sorting techniques are unable to identify food grade from non-food grade packaging which consigns high value polymer resins into low grade; non food grade uses or worse still, landfill and incineration. We will enable a low cost labelling system suitable for commercialisation, to make this sorting a reality; support the long term viability for closed loop sorting of these materials (PP, PE, PET, e.g. plastic milk bottles, drinks containers to household detergent bottles). Previously our consortium demonstrated a labelling system that can be used for high speed sorting of various crushed plastic bottles at high belt speeds with high purity and high yield which has received a great deal of interest from global brands. 

To commercialise this proof of concept it is desirable to optimise the luminescent materials that will be taken forwards so we will develop a sustainable low cost luminescent marker system using low toxicity and environmentally safe materials, thus lowering any commercial barrier to enter the market.

Once this technology is proven then we will be in a strong position to seek wide implementation of our technology and run full scale field trials with major brand owners facilitated through our NextlooPP partner. This transformative project will have the effect to reduce inappropriate plastics disposal and increase recycling rates by increasing the monetary value of the recycled material. This will address the Plastics Pacts objective of 30% recycled content by finalising the underpinning luminescent labelling technology to be implemented. Implementation of this technology into the NextlooPP process will facilitate the availability of rPP granules for food, cosmetics and lower grade applications thus reducing the demand for virgin polymer.
