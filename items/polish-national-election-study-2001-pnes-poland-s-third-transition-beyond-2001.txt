Poland is not just another accession state; over half the entire population joining the EU in 2004 lives in Poland. So inevitably, Polish attitudes are even more typical of attitudes among the accession peoples than among the accession states. The data cover voting intention and behaviour, political and social issues, political party allegiance, political attitudes and left-right scale placement, role of the Church in Poland, tax policy, attitudes towards the European Union and NATO, privatization, economic, social and household conditions, world situation and demographic details such as age, marital status, employment, gender and religious belief.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Polish National Election Study, 2001 / PNES;\r\nPoland's Third Transition : Beyond 2001"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Polish National Election Study, 2001 / PNES;\r\nPoland's Third Transition : Beyond 2001"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/polish-national-election-study-2001-pnes-poland-s-third-transition-beyond-2001"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Polish National Election Study, 2001 / PNES;\r\nPoland's Third Transition : Beyond 2001"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Polish National Election Study, 2001 / PNES;\r\nPoland's Third Transition : Beyond 2001"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
