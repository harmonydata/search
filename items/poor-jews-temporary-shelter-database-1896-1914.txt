For migrants travelling on to other countries, the ship on which they left is often given, particularly for those bound for South Africa, where the database makes clear the Shelter’s important links with the Union and Castle shipping lines.  There are also sometimes miscellaneous notes recording individual circumstances, such as a relative to whom the migrant was going.

For migrants travelling on to other countries, the ship on which they left is often given, particularly for those bound for South Africa, where the database makes clear the Shelter’s important links with the Union and Castle shipping lines.  There are also sometimes miscellaneous notes recording individual circumstances, such as a relative to whom the migrant was going.  Derived columns have been added to the database to help identify migrants travelling together in family groups, and to link records in cases where a migrant’s arrival was entered in both a main and a supplementary register.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Poor Jews' Temporary Shelter Database, 1896-1914"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Poor Jews' Temporary Shelter Database, 1896-1914"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/poor-jews-temporary-shelter-database-1896-1914"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Poor Jews' Temporary Shelter Database, 1896-1914"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Poor Jews' Temporary Shelter Database, 1896-1914"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
