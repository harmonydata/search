It will  focus on eight core countries, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic,  Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Russia and the Ukraine, employing a  range of historical, comparative, and quantitative methods to  test postulated relationships and identify key causal factors. For  certain quantitative purposes the study will use a wider set of 19  countries to test its findings. The project will assess the consequences  of different electoral systems, particularly the formulae for converting  votes into seats, the criteria laid down for political participation, and  regulations governing candidate selection and the conduct of election  campaigns.\nThe project led to academic publications that advanced understanding  of elections and the electoral process in new democracies.  Many theories derived from the study of Western Europe do not apply to  new democracies, where the impact of electoral systems is neither  immediate nor straightforward, for example mixed systems have led to  party fragmentation rather than to the expected party consolidation.
