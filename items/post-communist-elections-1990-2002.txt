However, since these generalisations were developed  in relation to established democratic polities, they may not  necessarily apply to newly democratising countries. This project  explored the role played by elections in the process of post-communist  democratisation by examining the impact of elections on democratic  performance, representativeness and policy responsiveness. It will  focus on eight core countries, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic,  Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Russia and the Ukraine, employing a  range of historical, comparative, and quantitative methods to  test postulated relationships and identify key causal factors. For  certain quantitative purposes the study will use a wider set of 19  countries to test its findings. The project will assess the consequences  of different electoral systems, particularly the formulae for converting  votes into seats, the criteria laid down for political participation, and  regulations governing candidate selection and the conduct of election  campaigns.
The project led to academic publications that advanced understanding  of elections and the electoral process in new democracies.  Many theories derived from the study of Western Europe do not apply to  new democracies, where the impact of electoral systems is neither  immediate nor straightforward, for example mixed systems have led to  party fragmentation rather than to the expected party consolidation.  The monograph <i>Embodying Democracy: Electoral System Design in  Post-communist Europe</i> is the first comparative explanation of how  post-communist countries choose their electoral rules. It demonstrates  the importance of context for understanding how actors engage in  strategic bargaining.
Contact with East European policy-makers provides a practical dimension,  both in the conduct of the research and in its ability to make  practical recommendations on the modification of electoral laws.  The resulting database will constitute an important international  resource for academics and practitioners.  The dataset comprises election results at constituency level of   post-communist parliamentary elections from Bulgaria, the Czech  Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia,  Slovakia and Ukraine.  Results include all candidates in  single-member constituencies (where relevant), separately for each  component in mixed electoral systems. Lower chamber results are  available for all countries listed, and results for the Senate are  also available for the Romanian elections.
