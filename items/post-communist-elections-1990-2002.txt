The monograph <i>Embodying Democracy: Electoral System Design in  Post-communist Europe</i> is the first comparative explanation of how  post-communist countries choose their electoral rules. It demonstrates  the importance of context for understanding how actors engage in  strategic bargaining.
Contact with East European policy-makers provides a practical dimension,  both in the conduct of the research and in its ability to make  practical recommendations on the modification of electoral laws.  The resulting database will constitute an important international  resource for academics and practitioners.  The dataset comprises election results at constituency level of   post-communist parliamentary elections from Bulgaria, the Czech  Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia,  Slovakia and Ukraine.  Results include all candidates in  single-member constituencies (where relevant), separately for each  component in mixed electoral systems. Lower chamber results are  available for all countries listed, and results for the Senate are  also available for the Romanian elections.
