This article proposes a social simulation approach to the topic of opinion dynamics from a political communication perspective to understand how social network configurations and the media environment contribute to the emergence of national identity polarisation.

This article proposes a social simulation approach to the topic of opinion dynamics from a political communication perspective to understand how social network configurations and the media environment contribute to the emergence of national identity polarisation. We built an agent-based simulation model of national identity dynamics with a multilayer multiplex network of interacting agents in a hybrid media environment of both, traditional media and social media platforms. We use the Catalan secessionist movement to ground and contextualise our model. Using this simulation approach allows to disentangle the mechanisms through which social media filter bubbles and individual social networks may contribute to the emergence of national identity polarisation. We found that the initial social network setup conditions had a large impact on the emergence of national identity polarisation amongst agents. In particular, homophily-based social networks produced greater national identity polarisation compared to random networks, especially in the presence of social media filtering algorithms, selectively exposing agents to national identity-supportive information. Our results emphasise the importance of selective exposure by social media filtering algorithms and one's social networks for the polarisation of national identity. Therefore providing further evidence of the negative effects of social media platforms for polarisation and social cohesion, generally.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"The Power of Social Networks and Social Media’s Filter Bubble in Shaping National Identities: An Agent-Based Model, 2019-2022"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"The Power of Social Networks and Social Media’s Filter Bubble in Shaping National Identities: An Agent-Based Model, 2019-2022"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/power-of-social-networks-and-social-media-s-filter-bubble-in-shaping-national-identities-an-agent-based-model-2019-2022"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"The Power of Social Networks and Social Media’s Filter Bubble in Shaping National Identities: An Agent-Based Model, 2019-2022"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The Power of Social Networks and Social Media’s Filter Bubble in Shaping National Identities: An Agent-Based Model, 2019-2022"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
