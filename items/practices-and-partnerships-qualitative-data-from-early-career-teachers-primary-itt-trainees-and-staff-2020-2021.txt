Original plans for the project were impacted by COVID-19 and, as such, the final scope of the research is smaller than planned. The project involved capturing data on the experience of Primary trainee teachers and Primary ITT staff  in the form of online questionnaires. In addition, interviews were conducted with three early career teachers who had previously contributed to the researcher’s doctoral research as trainee teachers. The findings explore the lived experience of learning to teach and preparing teachers, with particular reflections on the impact of the global pandemic.My research is concerned with initial teacher education in England. In my PhD, I considered how the choice of learning environment impacts on the learning and development of trainee teachers. Sitting within the socio-cultural domain, the research was theoretically framed by an understanding of ethnography as 'both a process and a product' (Britzman 1995:229). The intensive yearlong immersion in three different training sites illuminated the cultures of the differing providers, demonstrating differences between routes both in terms of the structure and development of teacher learning and the effectiveness and sustainability of teacher preparation. The research resulting in the generation of rich, original data giving focused insight into what it looks and feels like to learn to teach in the increasingly marketized environment of teacher training in England. \nThe subsequent conceptual theorising led to the formation of a framework addressing conflict, transition and agency. This conceptual framework has the capacity for analysis that transcends the specifics of individual programmes, both in the UK and internationally.\nTeacher education in England has seen significant changes over the past three decades (Murray & Mutton, 2015; Cochran-Smith, 2015), with reforms to initial teacher training resulting in a fragmented landscape in England that differs from the rest of the United Kingdom.

It embraces crucial research strands for the development of next-generation public services identified in the ESRC Delivery Plan (2019), with a focus on initial teacher education and ongoing professional education combined with further research into the impact of different routes into teaching.\nIn applying for this Fellowship, my aim is to ensure that the findings and ramifications of my doctoral research are shared with a range of audiences, both within and outside academia. The undertaking of a research visit to a key international institution for teacher education will facilitate discussion and potential collaboration. The production of peer-reviewed articles exploring the findings and the methodology of my research will be supplemented by the writing of a book proposal addressing the concept of identity in teacher education.

The intensive yearlong immersion in three different training sites illuminated the cultures of the differing providers, demonstrating differences between routes both in terms of the structure and development of teacher learning and the effectiveness and sustainability of teacher preparation. The research resulting in the generation of rich, original data giving focused insight into what it looks and feels like to learn to teach in the increasingly marketized environment of teacher training in England. 
The subsequent conceptual theorising led to the formation of a framework addressing conflict, transition and agency. This conceptual framework has the capacity for analysis that transcends the specifics of individual programmes, both in the UK and internationally.
Teacher education in England has seen significant changes over the past three decades (Murray & Mutton, 2015; Cochran-Smith, 2015), with reforms to initial teacher training resulting in a fragmented landscape in England that differs from the rest of the United Kingdom. Situated within this increasingly complex landscape of initial teacher education provision, this project proposal addresses the need to ensure that there are mechanisms for focused support for trainees and for teacher educators working with newcomers to the profession. It embraces crucial research strands for the development of next-generation public services identified in the ESRC Delivery Plan (2019), with a focus on initial teacher education and ongoing professional education combined with further research into the impact of different routes into teaching.
In applying for this Fellowship, my aim is to ensure that the findings and ramifications of my doctoral research are shared with a range of audiences, both within and outside academia. The undertaking of a research visit to a key international institution for teacher education will facilitate discussion and potential collaboration. The production of peer-reviewed articles exploring the findings and the methodology of my research will be supplemented by the writing of a book proposal addressing the concept of identity in teacher education. In addition, the writing of a journal article around the history of CPD for teachers will broaden the scope of my research and build on my existing publication track record.
Engagement with trainees, teacher educators, school leaders and school mentors will further develop my research, ensuring that there is a practical and measurable impact from the research findings. The production and trialling of resources for use in the training environment and in schools will broaden the impact of my research and make a direct link between my own career as a teacher and senior leader and my development as a researcher. 
Throughout the Fellowship, I intend to exploit opportunities to engage in networking, attending relevant conferences and meetings and presenting my research to different audiences. It is also my intention to further develop my own research skills through the undertaking of relevant training.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Practices and Partnerships: Qualitative Data from Early Career Teachers, Primary ITT Trainees and Staff, 2020-2021"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Practices and Partnerships: Qualitative Data from Early Career Teachers, Primary ITT Trainees and Staff, 2020-2021"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/practices-and-partnerships-qualitative-data-from-early-career-teachers-primary-itt-trainees-and-staff-2020-2021"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Practices and Partnerships: Qualitative Data from Early Career Teachers, Primary ITT Trainees and Staff, 2020-2021"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Practices and Partnerships: Qualitative Data from Early Career Teachers, Primary ITT Trainees and Staff, 2020-2021"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
