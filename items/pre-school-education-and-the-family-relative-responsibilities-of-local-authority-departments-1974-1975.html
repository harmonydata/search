Q1:pre-school groups
Information was elicited on the number of groups for pre-school children in the area, their organisation and management structure and the number of children attending them. Questions also covered premises, finance, staffing, waiting lists, links with parents and with other agencies.
Q2:children attending groups
The following information was sought for each child: sex, age, age at entry to group, pattern of attendance, distance and method of travel from home to group; home background (number of parents at home, whether mother worked, father&#x27;s occupation).
Q3:all children in area aged 3-4 years
Health visitors were asked to provide the following information from their records: age, sex, pre-school experience, parents at home, whether mother worked, provision for children of working mothers, whether handicapped, at risk, estimates of &#x27;diet&#x27;, &#x27;mothering&#x27;, `development&#x27;, clinic attendance, whether member of &#x27;problem family&#x27;.
Q4:professionals
This questionnaire examined attitudes towards pre-school education among teachers, nursery nurses, playgroup supervisors, chairmen of playgroup committees, health visitors, social workers, youth and community workers. Areas looked at in particular were: the importance of &#x27;professionalism&#x27; in pre-school groups, parent involvement; co-operation between voluntary and professional groups and between individuals and agencies involved with pre-school children and their families.
I1:parents
Parents of 3-4 year old children in the area were interviewed to assess the kind of provision they would like for their children and, if they were already attending, whether they were satisfied with the provision received. Questions also covered the qualities looked for in those who run pre-school groups and the kind of involvement they would like in their children&#x27;s groups.
I2:professionals
As in Q4, attitudes were again examined towards&#x27;professionalism&#x27;, parent involvement, inter-departmental relationships and co-operation between voluntary and professional groups. Questions also covered patterns of parent demand and the proportional lack of children form the lower social groups in pre-school education."/><meta property="og:title" content="Pre-School Education and the Family : Relative Responsibilities of Local Authority Departments, 1974-1975"/><meta property="og:description" content="To examine the relative contributions of various professional and voluntary groups to an integrated pattern of pre-school education in one Regional Authority.

an integrated pattern of pre-school education in one Regional Authority.  Variables\\nQ1:pre-school groups\\nInformation was elicited on the number of groups for pre-school children in the area, their organisation and management structure and the number of children attending them. Questions also covered premises, finance, staffing, waiting lists, links with parents and with other agencies.\\nQ2:children attending groups\\nThe following information was sought for each child: sex, age, age at entry to group, pattern of attendance, distance and method of travel from home to group; home background (number of parents at home, whether mother worked, father's occupation).\\nQ3:all children in area aged 3-4 years\\nHealth visitors were asked to provide the following information from their records: age, sex, pre-school experience, parents at home, whether mother worked, provision for children of working mothers, whether handicapped, at risk, estimates of 'diet', 'mothering', `development', clinic attendance, whether member of 'problem family'.\\nQ4:professionals\\nThis questionnaire examined attitudes towards pre-school education among teachers, nursery nurses, playgroup supervisors, chairmen of playgroup committees, health visitors, social workers, youth and community workers. Areas looked at in particular were: the importance of 'professionalism' in pre-school groups, parent involvement; co-operation between voluntary and professional groups and between individuals and agencies involved with pre-school children and their families.\\nI1:parents\\nParents of 3-4 year old children in the area were interviewed to assess the kind of provision they would like for their children and, if they were already attending, whether they were satisfied with the provision received. Questions also covered the qualities looked for in those who run pre-school groups and the kind of involvement they would like in their children's groups.\\nI2:professionals\\nAs in Q4, attitudes were again examined towards'professionalism', parent involvement, inter-departmental relationships and co-operation between voluntary and professional groups. Questions also covered patterns of parent demand and the proportional lack of children form the lower social groups in pre-school education.\",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/pre-school-education-and-the-family-relative-responsibilities-of-local-authority-departments-1974-1975\",\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-1096-1\"],\"keywords\":[]}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1a:T929,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"To examine the relative contributions of various professional and voluntary groups to an integrated pattern of pre-school education in one Regional Authority.
