Post-abortion care (PAC) is a strategy to address the problem of the outcomes of unsafe abortion.This research aims to establish how investment in safe abortion services impacts on the socio-economic conditions of women and their households, and the implications for policy-making and service provision in Zambia.
The microeconomic impact of out-of-pocket health expenditure for  reproductive health and abortion care, have received little attention.The data available for sub-Saharan Africa are particularly scanty and poor quality.
The approach is multi-disciplinary, with primary data collection of both qualitative and quantitative data, including a quantitative survey and in-depth qualitative interviews with women who have sought PAC, and policymaker interviews.
Zambia's relatively liberal legal context, and the existence of PAC provision facilitates research on issues related to abortion which can have broader lessons for developments elsewhere in the region.The majority of women seeking abortion-related care in Zambia do so for PAC following an unsafe abortion, and have not accessed safe abortion services.This demands better understanding and analysis.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Pregnancy termination trajectories in Zambia: The socio-economic costs"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Pregnancy termination trajectories in Zambia: The socio-economic costs"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/pregnancy-termination-trajectories-in-zambia-the-socio-economic-costs"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Pregnancy termination trajectories in Zambia: The socio-economic costs"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Pregnancy termination trajectories in Zambia: The socio-economic costs"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
