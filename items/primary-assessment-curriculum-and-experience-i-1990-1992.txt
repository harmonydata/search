The PACE (Primary Assessment, Curriculum and Experience) project aimed to study the impact on English primary schools of the introduction, following the 1988 Education Reform Act, of the National Curriculum and its associated assessment procedures.  Questionnaires and interviews with heads and infant teachers in forty-eight schools in eight varied areas, provided background data for a closer focus on nine schools.  Children as well as teachers in primary school classes were interviewed.  These randomly selected pupils formed a cohort who have taken part in the subsequent years of the study.  New assessment procedures were also observed and analysed as they were introduced.
The project consisted of three phases: phase 1 (SN:3486) was carried out in 1990-1992, phase 2 (SN:3470) in 1993-1994 and phase 3(SN:3969) in 1995-1996.  
Pupils of the original cohort, continued to be observed and interviewed, as did their teachers into year 6 (phase 3). In addition, teachers and heads in the wider sample of schools have again been interviewed; in this phase both Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 teachers provide material on the degree and kind of change experienced in primary schools during a period of unprecedented innovation.  
 <i>Phase One of the PACE Study (PACE 1)</i>
This dataset consists of six files:
PACE Advance Questionnaire to Teachers and Headteachers 1990 (TQ01/1TQUEST)
PACE Headteacher Interviews 1990 (2HT INT 90)
PACE Reception and Year 1 Teacher Interviews 1990 (2T INT 90)

PACE Headteacher Interviews 1992 (6HT INT 92)
PACE Year 1 and Year 2 Teacher Interviews 1992 (6T INT 92)
The aims of the survey are:
To analyse the responses of heads, teachers and children in infant schools to the National Curriculum and its assessment procedures
To examine the impact of the National Curriculum and its assessment procedures on the curriculum and pedagogy of the infant school
To evaluate the assessment procedures and the materials in use and to examine their effect on children
To develop an innovative `federated research' methodology, whereby the large-scale core project will provide a focus and context for smaller-scale studies, including teachers' action research
To provide a basis for a projected continuing study of the National Curriculum at junior school level.
