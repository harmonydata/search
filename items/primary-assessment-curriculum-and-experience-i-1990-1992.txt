The project consisted of three phases: phase 1 (SN:3486) was carried out in 1990-1992, phase 2 (SN:3470) in 1993-1994 and phase 3(SN:3969) in 1995-1996.  
Pupils of the original cohort, continued to be observed and interviewed, as did their teachers into year 6 (phase 3). In addition, teachers and heads in the wider sample of schools have again been interviewed; in this phase both Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 teachers provide material on the degree and kind of change experienced in primary schools during a period of unprecedented innovation.

The aims of the survey are:
To analyse the responses of heads, teachers and children in infant schools to the National Curriculum and its assessment procedures
To examine the impact of the National Curriculum and its assessment procedures on the curriculum and pedagogy of the infant school
To evaluate the assessment procedures and the materials in use and to examine their effect on children
To develop an innovative `federated research' methodology, whereby the large-scale core project will provide a focus and context for smaller-scale studies, including teachers' action research
To provide a basis for a projected continuing study of the National Curriculum at junior school level.
