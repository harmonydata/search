2c:Tbd1,<i>Background to the PACE study</i>
The PACE (Primary Assessment, Curriculum and Experience) project aimed to study the impact on English primary schools of the introduction, following the 1988 Education Reform Act, of the National Curriculum and its associated assessment procedures.  Questionnaires and interviews with heads and infant teachers in forty-eight schools in eight varied areas, provided background data for a closer focus on nine schools.  Children as well as teachers in primary school classes were interviewed.  These randomly selected pupils formed a cohort who have taken part in the subsequent years of the study.  New assessment procedures were also observed and analysed as they were introduced.
The project consisted of three phases: phase 1 (SN:3486) was carried out in 1990-1992, phase 2 (SN:3470) in 1993-1994 and phase 3(SN:3969) in 1995-1996.  
Pupils of the original cohort, continued to be observed and interviewed, as did their teachers into year 6 (phase 3). In addition, teachers and heads in the wider sample of schools have again been interviewed; in this phase both Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 teachers provide material on the degree and kind of change experienced in primary schools during a period of unprecedented innovation.  
 <i>Phase 3 of the PACE Study (PACE 3)</i>
This dataset consists of four files:
PACE Year 4, 5 and 6 Class Teacher Questionnaire, Autumn Term Year 6 1995/96
PACE Year 4, 5 and 6 Class Teacher Interview, Autumn Term Year 6 1995/96
PACE Head Teacher Questionnaire, Autumn Term Year 6 1995/96
PACE Head Teacher Interview, Autumn Term Year 6 1995/96
This is the final part of a unique, longitudinal study of teacher and pupil experiences and practices in primary schools in England. It is concerned with teachers' conceptions of professionalism and with pupil perspectives of primary schooling, in the context of observed classroom behaviours and practices related to curriculum, pedagogy and assessment. Additionally, this analysis will be related to the social contexts of the sample schools and to government policies over the period of study since 1989, thus enabling a consideration of the unintended consequences, mediation and coping strategies of the major policy changes which have impacted on English primary education since that time.  The topics covered in this study are:
Teacher background characteristics; pedagogy and pupil experience; curriculum change and continuity; assessment practices; impact of the National Curriculum on teaching and learning; changes in teachers' roles; changes in planning and management within the school; teacher/pupil relationships; staff relationships.
Headteacher perspectives; school relationships; impact of recent policy changes; curriculum and pedagogy; assessment policy; pupil experience.
Characteristics of teachers and headteachers, e.g. age, sex, years of experience, socio-economic catchment area of school; educational objectives for the children; accountability; meaning of professional responsibility.27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2c"}]
