PACE Head Teacher Interview, Autumn Term Year 6 1995/96
This is the final part of a unique, longitudinal study of teacher and pupil experiences and practices in primary schools in England. It is concerned with teachers' conceptions of professionalism and with pupil perspectives of primary schooling, in the context of observed classroom behaviours and practices related to curriculum, pedagogy and assessment. Additionally, this analysis will be related to the social contexts of the sample schools and to government policies over the period of study since 1989, thus enabling a consideration of the unintended consequences, mediation and coping strategies of the major policy changes which have impacted on English primary education since that time.  The topics covered in this study are:
Teacher background characteristics; pedagogy and pupil experience; curriculum change and continuity; assessment practices; impact of the National Curriculum on teaching and learning; changes in teachers' roles; changes in planning and management within the school; teacher/pupil relationships; staff relationships.
Headteacher perspectives; school relationships; impact of recent policy changes; curriculum and pedagogy; assessment policy; pupil experience.
Characteristics of teachers and headteachers, e.g. age, sex, years of experience, socio-economic catchment area of school; educational objectives for the children; accountability; meaning of professional responsibility.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Primary Assessment Curriculum and Experience III, 1995-1996 / PACE III"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Primary Assessment Curriculum and Experience III, 1995-1996 / PACE III"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/primary-assessment-curriculum-and-experience-iii-1995-1996-pace-iii"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Primary Assessment Curriculum and Experience III, 1995-1996 / PACE III"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Primary Assessment Curriculum and Experience III, 1995-1996 / PACE III"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
