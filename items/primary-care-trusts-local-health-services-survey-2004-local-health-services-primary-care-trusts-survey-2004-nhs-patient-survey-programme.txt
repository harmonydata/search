Further information about the National Patient Survey Programme may be found on the CQC Patient Survey Programme web pages.

 The Local Health Services (Primary Care Trusts) Survey was designed to provide actionable feedback to each participating trust on patients' views of the care they had received in PCTs in England, as well as providing the Healthcare Commission with patient-focused indicators to feed into the 2004 performance ratings for acute and specialist NHS trusts.
 Topics covered included: contact with general practitioners; courtesy of and confidence in medical and other staff; cleanliness of surgery/health centre; medical consultations; medicines and treatment prescribed and whether enough information and guidance was provided; hospital and specialist referrals (including choice and decision-making); dental treatment; immunization and blood pressure checks offered; and respondents' smoking behaviour and demographic characteristics.29:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2d"}]
