The project ran from October 2020 – December 2021 and the research took place between April and September 2021, involving ten semi-structured interviews with prison officers working across five prisons in Scotland. These prisons held male and female prisoners, young people, and those serving short, long and life sentences as well as the open estate. The interviews explored the prison officers&#x27; understanding and operationalisation of the Scottish Prison Service Family Strategy 2017-2022.Families – Inside Prison and Out was a one-year Postdoctoral Fellowship project funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ES/V010107/1) and carried out at the University of Strathclyde. As part of this wider Fellowship a research project took place with prison officers across Scotland (Prisons, Prison Officers  and Prisoners’ Families). 

Families of prisoners are increasingly recognised as important within criminal justice policy and practice, and by academics. This is reflected in the significant increase in academic articles in this area and in government and prison service reports and policies. They are seen as important both through the role they can play in reducing re-offending, and increasingly in their own right in terms of the need to address the impact of a prison sentence on those it affects, generally disproportionately those who are already within marginalised positions in society.

There is little understanding, however, around how these policies are understood and put into practice by those working within the prison system.
