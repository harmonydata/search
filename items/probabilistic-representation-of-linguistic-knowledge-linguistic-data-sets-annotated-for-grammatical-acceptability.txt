We are hoping that this kind of model will provide a straightforward explanation for the fact that individual native speakers generally judge the well formedness of sentences along a continuum, rather than through the imposition of a sharp boundary between acceptable and unacceptable sentences.

We are experimenting with different sorts of language models that contain a variety of parameters encoding properties of sentences and probability distributions over corpora.

We are training these models on subsets of the British National Corpus (BNC), and we are testing them on additional subsets of the BNC into which we have introduced grammatical deformations and infelicities of varying degrees of severity and subtlety.

We hope to show that a sufficiently complex enriched language model can encode a fair amount of what native speakers know about the syntax of their language.
