SN:14 includes two questionnaires (A1 and B1) distributed to probationers in one rural and three urban areas in July 1969. These probationers had completed their probationary year and had experienced only traditional forms of in-service guidance; they formed a control group for the project.
SN:15 includes nine questionnaires, distributed between September 1969 and July 1970 in conjunction with a series of project-organized induction courses and discussion meetings. The questionnaires were administered according to the following timetable:
Sept 1969: Questionnaire A2 and B2 to all probationers
Sept-Oct 1969: Questionnaire C1 to those attending induction conference
Oct-Dec 1969: Questionnaire C2 to those attending discussion meetings
Jan-June 1970: Questionnaire C3 to those at optional topics courses
July 1970: Questionnaire C4 to those at overview conference
July 1970: Questionnaire C5 to all probationers
July 1970: Questionnaire A3 to all probationers
(Questionnaire A1, A2 and A3 were essentially identical, B1, B2 and B3 completely identical.)
The questionnaires therefore measured both response to various course programmes and discussion meetings, and the overall effect of such courses on the professional judgements, opinions and actions of probationary teachers.  Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
Questionnaire A1, distributed to teachers just finishing their probationary year, elicited information on the following:
1. Placement, Guidance and Assessment: whether teaching age-range and subjects in which they were trained; whether they would recommend the LEA to a friend; whether any of a given list of conditions had limited their participation in leisure, social or cultural activities; their reasons for seeking work in their present area; their knowledge of, and use made of, various services to teachers within the LEA or area; knowledge of assessment procedures and processes; ways in which respondent feels that the LEA Inspector or Adviser, the Head or their colleagues could be of use to the probationer; their opinion on the amount of advice offered by colleagues, Head, Inspector, Head of Department or College lecturers; whether advice was actually sought from any of these and any further observations they have on probationary year guidance and assessment.
2. Classroom Experience: respondents asked to assess the amount of help received from various aspects of training course; to categorize the approach to teaching taught in College, found generally in present school, preferred by self and the approach actually used during each of the three terms of probationary year as predominantly formal, informal or a mixture of both; to outline any difficulties experienced in professional work during the year with details of any action taken to deal with them; to indicate ways in which respondent has changed or developed approach to teaching with reasons for any changes; and to indicate the degree of satisfaction he felt with teaching performance during the year.
3.17:T122a,The purpose of this study was to collect information about the conditions, opportunities, problems and needs of teachers at the beginning of their career and to assist in the development of services to them.
<i>National Survey of Teachers in Their First Year of Service, 1966-1967</i> (SN:66031,66032,66033,67032,67033)
This group of surveys serves both as a demographic study of probationary teachers and as a longitudinal study in which characteristics of the teachers at the beginning and at the end of the year were related to each other and to characteristics of the school and of the employing authority. It covers seven main areas: probationary background and training; their distribution; appointment and placement; in-service guidance; probationers in the classroom; in the school community; outside school; and career intentions.
Arising from findings of this group of surveys, a further research and development project was undertaken by the University of Bristol to investigate the needs, problems, and advantages associated with the mounting of in-service courses for probationers. The data from this project are held as SN:14 <i>Probationary Teachers, 1968-1969</i> and SN:15 <i>Probationary Teachers, 1969-1970</i>.
The phasing of the enquiry followed the timetable:
Spring 1966: Survey of Directors of Education in the 162 LEA's in England and Wales (SN:66031)
June 1966: Survey of Head Teachers (SN:66032)
Sept 1966: First survey of probationers (SN:66033)
