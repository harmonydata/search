Key themes discussed in these qualitative data are women’s work, use of family planning, and the factors that facilitated or were challenging during their return to work during the postpartum period. Interviews with policy makers and key stakeholders also conductedOur previous ESRC-funded research in Burkina Faso showed the adverse effects of serious illnesses during pregnancy and the high costs of care on women's lives. The aim of this new project is to gain a detailed understanding of how the arrival of a new baby affects women’s productivity and how family planning and other reproductive health services can help women returning to good health and work.



This multi-disciplinary project includes three sub-studies.



Sub-study A is a secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey data collected in Burkina Faso from 2001-2006.



Sub-study B is a cohort study of women identified in the community during pregnancy and the first trimester after childbirth. Over a period of nine months, women will be interviewed three times about their health, preparations they made for childbirth and the period after childbirth, changes in paid work (or education) and domestic work, fertility intention and contraceptive needs. Interviewers will measure women's blood pressure and whether they have anaemia.



In sub-study C, qualitative methods will document how women and their family make decisions on work, childbirth and family planning. Sub-study C will re-interview a sub-sample of cohort women, observe some of them in their daily activities, and interview men, policy makers as well as health care providers.27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2b"}]
