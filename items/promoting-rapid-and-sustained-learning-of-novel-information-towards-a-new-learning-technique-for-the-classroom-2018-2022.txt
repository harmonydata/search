Each project has been published in peer-reviewed journals and the raw data and explanation of each data set has been deposited on the OSF (see individual OSF pages for details of each data set). This entry links to seven datasets, these are described in more detail in the uploaded documentation: 1. The formation and retrieval of holistic event memories across development: In this study, we sought to replicate the holistic retrieval of simultaneously encoded event elements in children, and examine whether children can similarly integrate across separated encoding contexts. 2. Make or break it: Boundary conditions for integrating multiple elements in episodic memory: Counter to previous studies that have shown no differences in holistic retrieval between simultaneously and separately encoded event elements, adults did not show evidence of holistic retrieval from separately encoded event elements when using a similar paradigm adapted for children (Experiment 1). We conducted a further five online experiments to explore the conditions under which holistic retrieval emerges following separated encoding of within-event associations, testing for influences of trial length (Experiment 2), the number of events learned (Experiment 3a), and stimulus presentation format (Experiments 3b, 4a, 4b). 3. Retrieval practice transfer effects for multielement event triplets: Here we tested for Retrieval Practice transfer effects under conditions known to induce integration of associated material at encoding, which may make transfer more likely.  4. Schematic information influences memory and generalisation behaviour for schema-relevant and -irrelevant information: We assessed memory and generalisation behaviour for information related to an underlying pattern, where a schema could be extracted (schema-relevant), and information that was unrelated and therefore irrelevant to the extracted schema (schema-irrelevant). 5. United we fall: All-or-none forgetting of complex episodic events: Across 4 experiments, we show that retrieval dependency is found both immediately after learning and following a 12-hour and 1-week delay. Further, the amount of retrieval dependency after a delay is greater than that predicted by a model of independent forgetting. 6. Targeted memory reactivation during sleep can induce forgetting of overlapping memories: Memory reactivation during sleep can shape new memories into a long-term form. Reactivation of memories can be induced via the delivery of auditory cues during sleep. Although this targeted memory reactivation (TMR) approach can strengthen newly acquired memories, research has tended to focus on single associative memories. We asked if a similar pattern of forgetting occurs when TMR is used to cue reactivation of overlapping pair-wise associations during sleep. 7. Tracking the emergence of location-based spatial representations in human scene-selective cortex: Using fMRI representational similarity analysis and linear mixed-models, we tracked the emergence of location-based representations in scene-selective brain regions. We estimated patterns of activity for two distinct scenes, taken before and after participants learnt they were from the same location.In education, we want students to acquire new information quickly and retain that information over long time periods. Unfortunately, student learning rarely conforms to this ideal. We can learn quickly when new information is supported by previously acquired knowledge of the topic. However, when a topic is entirely novel, learning is typically slow and effortful. For example, we might rapidly learn about the structure of neurons ('brain cells') if we have pre-existing knowledge about the structure of other cells in the body. However, that information would take time to learn, and would likely be forgotten rapidly, when not supported by pre-existing knowledge.\n\nCognitive psychology has revealed several post-encoding strategies and techniques to improve long-term retention of novel information. For example, repeated learning spaced out over time (the 'spacing effect'), as well as practicing retrieving the information ('retrieval practice'), have been shown in increase the retention of newly learnt information in the long-term. Ideally, we want to be able to learn new information without the need for pre-existing knowledge, or more effortful post-encoding techniques.

Make or break it: Boundary conditions for integrating multiple elements in episodic memory: Counter to previous studies that have shown no differences in holistic retrieval between simultaneously and separately encoded event elements, adults did not show evidence of holistic retrieval from separately encoded event elements when using a similar paradigm adapted for children (Experiment 1). We conducted a further five online experiments to explore the conditions under which holistic retrieval emerges following separated encoding of within-event associations, testing for influences of trial length (Experiment 2), the number of events learned (Experiment 3a), and stimulus presentation format (Experiments 3b, 4a, 4b). 3. Retrieval practice transfer effects for multielement event triplets: Here we tested for Retrieval Practice transfer effects under conditions known to induce integration of associated material at encoding, which may make transfer more likely.  4. Schematic information influences memory and generalisation behaviour for schema-relevant and -irrelevant information: We assessed memory and generalisation behaviour for information related to an underlying pattern, where a schema could be extracted (schema-relevant), and information that was unrelated and therefore irrelevant to the extracted schema (schema-irrelevant). 5. United we fall: All-or-none forgetting of complex episodic events: Across 4 experiments, we show that retrieval dependency is found both immediately after learning and following a 12-hour and 1-week delay. Further, the amount of retrieval dependency after a delay is greater than that predicted by a model of independent forgetting. 6. Targeted memory reactivation during sleep can induce forgetting of overlapping memories: Memory reactivation during sleep can shape new memories into a long-term form. Reactivation of memories can be induced via the delivery of auditory cues during sleep. Although this targeted memory reactivation (TMR) approach can strengthen newly acquired memories, research has tended to focus on single associative memories. We asked if a similar pattern of forgetting occurs when TMR is used to cue reactivation of overlapping pair-wise associations during sleep. 7. Tracking the emergence of location-based spatial representations in human scene-selective cortex: Using fMRI representational similarity analysis and linear mixed-models, we tracked the emergence of location-based representations in scene-selective brain regions. We estimated patterns of activity for two distinct scenes, taken before and after participants learnt they were from the same location.In education, we want students to acquire new information quickly and retain that information over long time periods. Unfortunately, student learning rarely conforms to this ideal. We can learn quickly when new information is supported by previously acquired knowledge of the topic. However, when a topic is entirely novel, learning is typically slow and effortful. For example, we might rapidly learn about the structure of neurons ('brain cells') if we have pre-existing knowledge about the structure of other cells in the body. However, that information would take time to learn, and would likely be forgotten rapidly, when not supported by pre-existing knowledge.

Cognitive psychology has revealed several post-encoding strategies and techniques to improve long-term retention of novel information. For example, repeated learning spaced out over time (the 'spacing effect'), as well as practicing retrieving the information ('retrieval practice'), have been shown in increase the retention of newly learnt information in the long-term. Ideally, we want to be able to learn new information without the need for pre-existing knowledge, or more effortful post-encoding techniques. We have recently shown that learning can be fast, and sustained over long periods, without the need for pre-existing knowledge, if learnt in a specific manner.1a:T1242,The linked data sets are to behavioural, fMRI, and EEG experiments that tested the above theoretical ideas. Each project has been published in peer-reviewed journals and the raw data and explanation of each data set has been deposited on the OSF (see individual OSF pages for details of each data set).
