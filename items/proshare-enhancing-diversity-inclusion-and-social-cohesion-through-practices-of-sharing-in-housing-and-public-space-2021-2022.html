The research aimed to understand practices of sharing (focussing on materials goods, physical spaces and experiences/knowledge) in the field of housing and public space in socially mixed neighbourhoods.

The main findings for the research were:
- The proliferation of diverse sharing economies which are not formally recognised within traditional sharing economies
- The importance of community spaces and hubs in fostering sharing activities between stakeholders, sharing practices were often clustered around key community infrastructure
