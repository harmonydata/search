ProSHARE data therefore covers research carried out on the London and Paris cases. The project involved gathering of quantitative and qualitative data on sharing practices including; semi-structured qualitative interviews, co-design workshops and organisation mapping in each research context. Two Living labs were organised in relation with R-urban hubs in London and in Bagneux (Paris) during which all the co-design and mapping workshops took place. 

The research aimed to understand practices of sharing (focussing on materials goods, physical spaces and experiences/knowledge) in the field of housing and public space in socially mixed neighbourhoods. Through researching these practices it aimed to better understand what conditions enable sharing or conversely create barriers to sharing. Ultimately asking to what extent these practices foster collaboration and participation between diverse communities. 

The main findings for the research were:
- The proliferation of diverse sharing economies which are not formally recognised within traditional sharing economies
- The importance of community spaces and hubs in fostering sharing activities between stakeholders, sharing practices were often clustered around key community infrastructure
- Sharing practices proliferate when there is a strong sense of community and belonging to a neighbourhood
- Sharing can be both supported by political and institutional actors, but they can also stifle sharing practices and should be wary of power dynamicsProSHARE was a transnational research project conducting research on sharing practices in eight European cities (Berlin, Stuttgart, Kassel, Vienna, Uppsala, Stockholm, London and Paris). ProSHARE deals with 1) the forms and conditions in which practices of sharing in the field of housing and public space take place in socially mixed neighbourhoods and 2. the potential and limits of these practices for fostering participation and collaboration between diverse populations.  
The ProSHARE research consortium (University of Kassel, Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm, University of Sheffield, Vienna University of Technology, Uppsala University, University of Applied Sciences of Berlin) explored how practices of sharing can contribute to reduce space competition and to enhance diversity, civic engagement, community building and social cohesion in the neighbourhoods of study.
