ProSHARE deals with 1) the forms and conditions in which practices of sharing in the field of housing and public space take place in socially mixed neighbourhoods and 2. the potential and limits of these practices for fostering participation and collaboration between diverse populations.  
The ProSHARE research consortium (University of Kassel, Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm, University of Sheffield, Vienna University of Technology, Uppsala University, University of Applied Sciences of Berlin) explored how practices of sharing can contribute to reduce space competition and to enhance diversity, civic engagement, community building and social cohesion in the neighbourhoods of study. The research employed mixed methods including qualitative surveys, interviews and Urban Living Lab (ULL) methodologies in which practices of sharing are explored through practical, participatory experiments.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"ProSHARE: Enhancing Diversity, Inclusion and Social Cohesion through Practices of Sharing in Housing and Public Space, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"ProSHARE: Enhancing Diversity, Inclusion and Social Cohesion through Practices of Sharing in Housing and Public Space, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/proshare-enhancing-diversity-inclusion-and-social-cohesion-through-practices-of-sharing-in-housing-and-public-space-2021-2022"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"ProSHARE: Enhancing Diversity, Inclusion and Social Cohesion through Practices of Sharing in Housing and Public Space, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"ProSHARE: Enhancing Diversity, Inclusion and Social Cohesion through Practices of Sharing in Housing and Public Space, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
