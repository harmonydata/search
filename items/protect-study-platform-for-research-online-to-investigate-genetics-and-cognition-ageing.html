PROTECT Study (Platform for Research Online To Investigate Genetics and Cognition \u0026 Ageing) is a longitudinal, online-based research initiative designed to enhance the understanding of cognitive ageing and the factors contributing to dementia. The study involves participants aged 50 and over who provide demographic and lifestyle information and engage in annual online cognitive assessments. These assessments help researchers track cognitive changes over time. Additionally, participants contribute DNA samples using at-home kits, allowing for genetic analysis. The study's comprehensive approach, combining cognitive data with genetic information, aims to identify risk factors and protective factors associated with cognitive decline and dementia, ultimately contributing to the development of interventions to promote healthy ageing.\"}}]]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"The PROTECT Study (Platform for Research Online To Investigate Genetics and Cognition \u0026 Ageing)\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"The PROTECT Study is an online-based study that aims to improve understanding of the ageing brain and why some people develop dementia.
