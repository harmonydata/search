It included surveys of the general adult population, students in adult education and tutors, between April 1966 and June 1968. Seven areas were selected for the survey, based on four factors for which statistical information could be obtained: terminal education age; occupational composition (social class); proportion of domestic rateable value from property of high rateable value; and inter-censal population movement between 1951 and 1961.
The survey of adults (SN:66040) collected data by means of interviews with a random sample of the adult population of each area, and covered attitudes to, knowledge of, and participation in adult educational activities.
The survey of students (SN:66041) collected data by means of questionnaires completed by a random sample of students currently enrolled in Local Education Authority, extra-mural and Workers&#x27; Educational Association classes, covering the same points with additional data on circumstances relating to aspects of the class attended.
A third survey (SN:66042) collected data by means of enquiries addressed to part-time tutors in adult education to provide information on staffs&#x27; own motives and attitudes, recruitment, future teaching intentions and also their views as to students&#x27; motivations and satisfactions.  Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
In this survey of leisure time and educational facilities, a random sample of the adult population in each of the 7 areas was asked for information on the amount of personal leisure time available and activities undertaken in it, respondent&#x27;s membership of local groups or clubs, knowledge of facilities for adult education locally and opinion on advertising of such facilities, details of any participation in adult education with reasons for enrolling and degree of satisfaction obtained, reasons for not enrolling in any such classes and future joining intentions, respondent&#x27;s interests and things about which he would like to know more, preferences for class times, opinions on classes currently offered in area and on the provision of adult education generally (e.g. how much money should be spent on it, amount of general interest in area in such classes, etc.) From a list of 24 given reasons for adults going to classes, respondent was asked to indicate whether each reason was, or would be, important to him personally, and to people generally. A similar list of 18 reasons for not going to classes required the same response.
Respondent was asked for his opinion on the sort of people who usually attend such classes (sex, age, marital status, type of personality), on the instructors, accommodation (comfortable or uncomfortable, modern or old-fashioned, specially designed for adults or for children) and atmosphere (pleasant or unpleasant). Respondent was further asked to list four radio or television series from which he had gained some educational stimulus and actual knowledge and, finally, for his opinion on his own level of performance at school.
