It included surveys of the general adult population, students in adult education and tutors, between April 1966 and June 1968. Seven areas were selected for the survey, based on four factors for which statistical information could be obtained: terminal education age; occupational composition (social class); proportion of domestic rateable value from property of high rateable value; and inter-censal population movement between 1951 and 1961.
The survey of adults (SN:66040) collected data by means of interviews with a random sample of the adult population of each area, and covered attitudes to, knowledge of, and participation in adult educational activities.
The survey of students (SN:66041) collected data by means of questionnaires completed by a random sample of students currently enrolled in Local Education Authority, extra-mural and Workers&#x27; Educational Association classes, covering the same points with additional data on circumstances relating to aspects of the class attended.
A third survey (SN:66042) collected data by means of enquiries addressed to part-time tutors in adult education to provide information on staffs&#x27; own motives and attitudes, recruitment, future teaching intentions and also their views as to students&#x27; motivations and satisfactions.  Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
The questionnaire administered here is substantially the same as that used for the Adult sample, with the following additions. Students enrolled in adult education (Local Education Authority, extra-mural and Workers&#x27; Educational Association classes) at the time were asked a series of questions concerning the class in which they were enrolled, including: subjects studied; main reasons for joining current class; distance travelled to class and transport used; sources of knowledge of general facilities and of current class, and respondent&#x27;s opinion on various aspects of the course itself (accommodation and facilities provided, supply of equipment, time of classes, length of course and of individual class, standard and content of course, level of teaching, amount of work assigned for completion at home, and amount of work expected, character of class work). Further questions elicited future enrolment intentions and finally, the satisfaction felt with the course generally and the main benefits expected from course.
