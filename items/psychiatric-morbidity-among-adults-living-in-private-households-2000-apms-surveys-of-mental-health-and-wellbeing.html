A further survey was conducted in 2000 (covering 16 to 74-year-olds) and included respondents living in England, Scotland and Wales. From 2007 onwards, the surveys have been commissioned by NHS Digital on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), including people aged over 16 (no upper age limit) living in England. For 2007 and 2014, the surveys were conducted by NatCen Social Research on behalf of NHS Digital. The surveys capture information on common mental disorders, mental health treatment and service use, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorder, autism, personality disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, alcohol, drugs, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, self-harm, and comorbidity.Further information can be found on the NHS Digital Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys webpage.A similar series covering young people aged 5 to 15/16, the Mental Health of Children and Young People Surveys (MHCYP), is also commissioned by NHS Digital. 
 The Psychiatric Morbidity among Adults Living in Private Households, 2000 survey was designed to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity according to diagnostic category among the adult household population of Great Britain, examine the varying use of services and receipt of care in relation to mental disorder, identify the nature and extent of disability associated with mental disorder, establish key current and lifetime factors which may be associated with mental disorder, and provide information on changes in the prevalence of disorder and related factors between 1993 and 2000.
  Topics covered in the survey include assessments of: neurotic symptoms &amp; disorder (CIS-R), psychotic disorder (SCAN), personality disorder (SCID II), alcohol misuse (AUDIT and SAD-Q) and drug dependence.
Other subjects also included were: general health and service use (including SF-12 and longstanding illness), socio-demographic data, education and employment, finances (income and debt), accommodation (tenure, stability, quality), stressful life events experienced, activities of daily living and informal care and intellectual functioning (NART, TICS-m and animal naming test).

Surveys of Psychiatric Morbidity) are a series of surveys which provide data on the prevalence of both treated and untreated psychiatric disorders in the adult population (aged 16 and over). The first survey was conducted in 1993, covering 16 to 64-year-olds. A further survey was conducted in 2000 (covering 16 to 74-year-olds) and included respondents living in England, Scotland and Wales. From 2007 onwards, the surveys have been commissioned by NHS Digital on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), including people aged over 16 (no upper age limit) living in England. For 2007 and 2014, the surveys were conducted by NatCen Social Research on behalf of NHS Digital. The surveys capture information on common mental disorders, mental health treatment and service use, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorder, autism, personality disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, alcohol, drugs, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, self-harm, and comorbidity.Further information can be found on the NHS Digital Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys webpage.A similar series covering young people aged 5 to 15/16, the Mental Health of Children and Young People Surveys (MHCYP), is also commissioned by NHS Digital. \\n The Psychiatric Morbidity among Adults Living in Private Households, 2000 survey was designed to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity according to diagnostic category among the adult household population of Great Britain, examine the varying use of services and receipt of care in relation to mental disorder, identify the nature and extent of disability associated with mental disorder, establish key current and lifetime factors which may be associated with mental disorder, and provide information on changes in the prevalence of disorder and related factors between 1993 and 2000.\\n  Topics covered in the survey include assessments of: neurotic symptoms \u0026 disorder (CIS-R), psychotic disorder (SCAN), personality disorder (SCID II), alcohol misuse (AUDIT and SAD-Q) and drug dependence.\\nOther subjects also included were: general health and service use (including SF-12 and longstanding illness), socio-demographic data, education and employment, finances (income and debt), accommodation (tenure, stability, quality), stressful life events experienced, activities of daily living and informal care and intellectual functioning (NART, TICS-m and animal naming test).\\nSee list of acronyms under Standard Measures below for full titles.\\n\\nStandard Measures\\nCIS-R: revised Clinical Interview Schedule\\nSCAN: Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry\\nSCID-II: Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV\\nAUDIT: Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test\\nSAD-Q: Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire\\nSF-12: Short Form 12\\nNART: National Adult Reading Test\\nTICS-m: modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Screening.\",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/psychiatric-morbidity-among-adults-living-in-private-households-2000-apms-surveys-of-mental-health-and-wellbeing\",\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-4653-1\"],\"keywords\":[],\"creator\":[{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"Office for National Statistics\"}]}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"c:[\"$\",\"$5\",null,{\"fallback\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":\"Loading...\"}],\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$L17\",null,{\"strategy\":\"beforeInteractive\",\"id\":\"structured-data\",\"type\":\"application/ld+json\",\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"$18\"}}],\"$L19\"]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1a:I[78977,[\"9692\",\"static/js/9692.83f9877c.js\",\"1828\",\"static/js/1828.31087444.js\",\"690\",\"static/js/690.e023e61b.js\",\"7133\",\"static/js/7133.521b2ecd.js\",\"9829\",\"static/js/9829.124a89b0.js\",\"867\",\"static/js/867.7f6bef5e.js\",\"2939\",\"static/js/2939.aa50df5c.js\",\"5183\",\"static/js/5183.9f1a7545.js\",\"5738\",\"static/js/5738.d28a9943.js\",\"3055\",\"static/js/3055.87b66c06.js\",\"8977\",\"static/js/8977.89625695.js\",\"6387\",\"static/js/app/items/%5Bslug%5D/page.cedc9485.js\"],\"default\"]\n1b:Tba8,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys (APMS) (formerly known as the Surveys of Psychiatric Morbidity) are a series of surveys which provide data on the prevalence of both treated and untreated psychiatric disorders in the adult population (aged 16 and over). The first survey was conducted in 1993, covering 16 to 64-year-olds.
