A number of questions on the respondent's local MP give information on his opinion of the effectiveness and quality of the MP and on the amount of attention paid to the feelings of the voters in decision-making. The respondent is also asked to assess the relative importance of various jobs MPs do, the relative importance of various views the MP speaks for in Parliament (views of the constituency, of the party, the local party, the parliamentary party, his own views, etc.), and of the various methods employed by parties in choosing candidates to stand for Parliament. A self-assessment of party allegiance and of the strength of political feelings generally, and a listing of the respondent's political activities within the last two to three years conclude the survey.
