From 2009 - 2018, PCOS was fielded as a module on NatCen’s face-to-face British Social Attitudes survey (BSA). The move to online fieldwork does create a risk that any differences identified between the results of the 2021 survey and those of previous waves of PCOS might, at least in part, be occasioned by the change of method rather than reflecting real change in public attitudes. However, PCOS 2021 has been designed to minimise, as far as possible, the impact of the change in mode on the comparability of the data over time
The survey data include variables covering the following main topics:demographicsawareness of organisations that use public statisticsparticipation in and use of Office for National Statistics (ONS) surveyslevel of trust in public institutionslevel of trust in ONS statistics, and reasons for thisusage and opinions of the Census, Consumer Price Index, Gross Domestic Product, employment/unemployment statistics, crime statistics, and Covid-19 statisticse:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Public Confidence in Official Statistics, 2021"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Public Confidence in Official Statistics, 2021"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/public-confidence-in-official-statistics-2021"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Public Confidence in Official Statistics, 2021"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Public Confidence in Official Statistics, 2021"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
