Experimental data
The Experimental data consists of one “Data_with_description_RM” file in .xlsx format. This file holds data from the effort task, where participants were required to declare a number of times they wanted to squeeze a handgrip device for group benefit or individual gain before actually completing the task. The file contains:
•	information about participants’ unique identifier (column A), group allocation (column B), gender (column C), age (column D), the condition they were in (column E), and the pot to which they contributed effort to begin with (column F), information about the number of trials participants intended to contribute to the individual (column H) and public pot (column I) and how many trials they actually contributed to the different pots (individual – column J, group – column K), as well as information about the round of the experiment (column G).

Experimental data also includes transcripts from the online chatroom. This includes 36 files in .docx format. The files contain transcripts from the online chats from Round 1 and Round 2 for each group separately. Each chat participant is marked by their unique identifier.

Project materials include two files in .docx format: the detailed information sheet given to participants, and the combined brief information sheet and consent form document.The need for new ideas in macroeconomics is evident. Most macroeconomists not only failed to recognise the weaknesses in the global economy before the financial crisis, their main macroeconomic model specifically excluded the possibility of financial vulnerability. Assumptions about human behaviour and how markets operate have undermined the effectiveness of macroeconomics as a guide for practical policy making.
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) is the UK&#x27;s foremost macroeconomics research institute outside of the university sector. As our mission is to understand the economic forces that shape peoples&#x27; lives and to influence policy. We are free of political and commercial interests and the constraints that can inhibit university departments.
Our network, Rebuilding Macroeconomics, would start the transformation of macroeconomics back into a useful policy science. We have created a team of 25 world-class social scientists from economics, psychology, anthropology, sociology, neuroscience, economic history, political science, biology and physics all renowned for challenging mainstream ideas to spear-head this effort.
Rebuilding Macroeconomics will challenge the central assumptions and methods of modern macroeconomics and identify the building blocks for a new and genuinely relevant macroeconomics. Our network will create ran opportunity for scholars, policy makers and practitioners to coalesce around a substantive macroeconomic policy question and to explore, learn from and challenge each other&#x27;s assumptions and ways of thinking and to consider possible new methods of investigation.
The Rebuilding Macroeconomics leadership team of will provide guidance by finding broad research agendas through a process of both guidance and discovery, through dialogue across the UK, that (a) directly address important macroeconomic policy issues, (b) facilitate research that would not be done otherwise, (c) bring new methodologies to bear in macroeconomics, and (d) that can attract enough scholars to launch and sustain an effective future research agenda.
Our leadership team will commission several targeted proof-of-concept &#x27;pilot projects&#x27; that are truly innovative, most promising and additional to existing macroeconomic research. The decisions will be taken in an open and transparent manner as befits public funds. An Advisory Group will oversee the disbursements to ensure that the projects meet our requirements listed above.
The RM network will offer value for money. Most Co-Investigators have signalled their willingness to work on a pro bono basis to maximise the amount of research money available for the best ideas. The allocation of funds will be made public through a transparent process.
NIESR will ensure that the Network engages with the public through social and traditional media. We will use podcasts and an App to describe the &#x27;pilot projects&#x27; and reconnect with the public through a series of televised or recorded lively debates on key macroeconomic issues that define our research agenda.
The Network will also engage with other networks in the UK and overseas to ensure as wide as possible influence and to achieve synergies with existing ESRC investments."/><meta property="og:title" content="Putting in Effort for the Benefit of All: The Role of Reward and Effort Requirements, 2019-2020"/><meta property="og:description" content="The data folder for the “Putting in effort for the benefit of all: the role of reward and effort requirements” project contains experimental data and project materials.
