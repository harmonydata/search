Europe was selected as the site for the study because of the relative lack of research relating to the organisation and practice of egg provision in this context and due to the unique constellation of regulatory oversight for member states who are subject to the requirements of the EU Tissue and Cells Directive. The study was based on a constructivist-interpretive epistemology and employed a sequential multiple-method design to explore processes and experiences of egg donation. Phase one involved mapping policy in the three countries and across Europe, stakeholder interviews and a literature review. Phase two involved analysis of clinic websites and specifically their online recruitment materials in the three countries. Phase three involved qualitative interviews with professionals and egg providers to understand perceptions, experiences and moral reasoning amongst those involved in the practice, and phase four involved stakeholder workshops and dissemination activities. Ethical approval for the study was granted by De Montfort University (ref 1989), Ghent University and CSIC.IVF with donor eggs was first intended for use with younger women suffering from ovarian failure or dysfunction. More recently there has been a sharp increase in use of donor eggs for women with age-related infertility, and a growing demand among gay male couples who combine the use of an egg donor and a surrogate in order to have a child. The increase in egg donation treatment has been enhanced by developments in freezing and storage techniques, meaning eggs can now be used independently of the time and place of their retrieval. Donated eggs are now used in over 74,000 IVF treatment cycles in Europe, yet little is known about the motivations, decision-making and experiences of women who provide their eggs for use in infertility treatment, particularly in the European context. 
 
The growing use of egg donation treatment is the subject of fierce political and ethical debate and presents a number of dilemmas for practice professionals and policy makers. While the selling of human eggs in Europe is formally prohibited according to EU legislation (&#x27;reasonable compensation&#x27; for egg providers is permitted), there is considerable variation in the interpretation of relevant regulations between countries, resulting in significant differences in practice. The UK, Belgium and Spain represent three countries at the cutting edge of technological developments in the infertility field but which have developed differing practices relating to how egg donation is practiced and governed. 
 
The overall aim of this study is to explore the social, political, economic and moral configuration of egg donation in the UK, Belgium and Spain. Our research questions are: How are egg donation practices shaped by national economic, political, cultural and moral contexts? How do new reproductive subjectivities emerge as a result of (gendered) socio-technical processes such as egg donation? How do egg providers understand and frame egg donation in the context of infertility treatment and how is their moral reasoning shaped by a neo-liberal, bio-economic context? What is the role of professional rationalities and commercial choreographies in a global reproductive marketplace? How can a comparison of contrasting policy and practice contexts facilitate improvements in egg donation? 

The study is largely qualitative and uses multiple methods of data collection, organised across five phases, to achieve its objectives. Phase one is a context-setting phase which will involve: reviewing the small number of existing studies; a detailed analysis of relevant policies and regulations about donation; and interviews with key European and country-level stakeholders. Phase two will involve analysis of donor recruitment and marketing materials to explore how donation is represented and to gain insight into recruitment practices. Phase three comprises detailed interviews with 75 women who have provided their eggs as well as interviews with professionals involved in donation. It will explore the experiences, motivations and ethical decision-making of women who provide their eggs as well as generating evidence about the practical, political and economic organisation of donation in the UK, Belgium and Spain. The objective of Phase four is to synthesise the findings from the previous phases for discussion at two workshops held in collaboration with key stakeholders and designed to help us develop recommendations from the study. Phase five will include an end of project conference and further dissemination."/><meta property="og:title" content="Qualitative Data Sets for EDNA Project, 2017-2020"/><meta property="og:description" content="The EDNA project was developed to consider the political, economic and moral configuration of egg donation for fertility treatment in the UK, Belgium and Spain.

Data Sets for EDNA Project, 2017-2020\",\"description\":\"The EDNA project was developed to consider the political, economic and moral configuration of egg donation for fertility treatment in the UK, Belgium and Spain. Europe was selected as the site for the study because of the relative lack of research relating to the organisation and practice of egg provision in this context and due to the unique constellation of regulatory oversight for member states who are subject to the requirements of the EU Tissue and Cells Directive. The study was based on a constructivist-interpretive epistemology and employed a sequential multiple-method design to explore processes and experiences of egg donation. Phase one involved mapping policy in the three countries and across Europe, stakeholder interviews and a literature review. Phase two involved analysis of clinic websites and specifically their online recruitment materials in the three countries. Phase three involved qualitative interviews with professionals and egg providers to understand perceptions, experiences and moral reasoning amongst those involved in the practice, and phase four involved stakeholder workshops and dissemination activities. Ethical approval for the study was granted by De Montfort University (ref 1989), Ghent University and CSIC.IVF with donor eggs was first intended for use with younger women suffering from ovarian failure or dysfunction. More recently there has been a sharp increase in use of donor eggs for women with age-related infertility, and a growing demand among gay male couples who combine the use of an egg donor and a surrogate in order to have a child. The increase in egg donation treatment has been enhanced by developments in freezing and storage techniques, meaning eggs can now be used independently of the time and place of their retrieval. Donated eggs are now used in over 74,000 IVF treatment cycles in Europe, yet little is known about the motivations, decision-making and experiences of women who provide their eggs for use in infertility treatment, particularly in the European context. \\n \\nThe growing use of egg donation treatment is the subject of fierce political and ethical debate and presents a number of dilemmas for practice professionals and policy makers. While the selling of human eggs in Europe is formally prohibited according to EU legislation ('reasonable compensation' for egg providers is permitted), there is considerable variation in the interpretation of relevant regulations between countries, resulting in significant differences in practice. The UK, Belgium and Spain represent three countries at the cutting edge of technological developments in the infertility field but which have developed differing practices relating to how egg donation is practiced and governed. \\n \\nThe overall aim of this study is to explore the social, political, economic and moral configuration of egg donation in the UK, Belgium and Spain. Our research questions are: How are egg donation practices shaped by national economic, political, cultural and moral contexts? How do new reproductive subjectivities emerge as a result of (gendered) socio-technical processes such as egg donation? How do egg providers understand and frame egg donation in the context of infertility treatment and how is their moral reasoning shaped by a neo-liberal, bio-economic context? What is the role of professional rationalities and commercial choreographies in a global reproductive marketplace? How can a comparison of contrasting policy and practice contexts facilitate improvements in egg donation? \\n\\nThe study is largely qualitative and uses multiple methods of data collection, organised across five phases, to achieve its objectives. Phase one is a context-setting phase which will involve: reviewing the small number of existing studies; a detailed analysis of relevant policies and regulations about donation; and interviews with key European and country-level stakeholders. Phase two will involve analysis of donor recruitment and marketing materials to explore how donation is represented and to gain insight into recruitment practices. Phase three comprises detailed interviews with 75 women who have provided their eggs as well as interviews with professionals involved in donation. It will explore the experiences, motivations and ethical decision-making of women who provide their eggs as well as generating evidence about the practical, political and economic organisation of donation in the UK, Belgium and Spain. The objective of Phase four is to synthesise the findings from the previous phases for discussion at two workshops held in collaboration with key stakeholders and designed to help us develop recommendations from the study.
