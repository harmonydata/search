These data are suitable for sentiment and discourse analysis, or analytic generalization – establishing that a concept exists within a population regardless of the number of people who hold it.  

The new version contains the 2005 and 2014 supplement data.

Words from the 2005 British General Election are substantively different from the other data. They were collected from the article 'Hearts or Minds: Men, Women and Leader Evaluations in the 2005 General Election' by K Winters, R Campbell in Political Communications: The General Election Campaign of 2005, 184-202. Words coded as 1 indicate the respondent thought the word was important in their considerations.

In addition, a supplementary dataset is provided of leaders’ evaluation data from a study with residents of Dundee after the Scottish Independence Referendum in 2014 (N = 287).The Qualitative Election Study of Britain (QESB) Party Leader Evaluation Database 2010 – 2024 contains the collection of 5,504 words and phrases that evaluate British political party leaders collected during pre-election focus groups and interviews conducted with participants from England, Scotland and Wales, during the General Election campaigns of 2010, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2024.  

The aim of this component of the QESB was to get language in use data on the various party leaders, to suppliment, compliment and perhaps contradict closed-ended question results from public polling and social surveys.

These data aren't released alongside the transcript data, however the transcripts refer to respondents' answers. The PIs of the study decided to collect the nearly 15 years worth of raw data and transform it for secondary reuse.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Qualitative Election Study of Britain Party Leader Evaluations \nDatabase, 2005-2024"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Qualitative Election Study of Britain Party Leader Evaluations \nDatabase, 2005-2024"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/qualitative-election-study-of-britain-party-leader-evaluations-database-2005-2024"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Qualitative Election Study of Britain Party Leader Evaluations \nDatabase, 2005-2024"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Qualitative Election Study of Britain Party Leader Evaluations \nDatabase, 2005-2024"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
