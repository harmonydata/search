The aim of this component of the QESB was to get language in use data on the various party leaders, to suppliment, compliment and perhaps contradict closed-ended question results from public polling and social surveys.

These data aren't released alongside the transcript data, however the transcripts refer to respondents' answers. The PIs of the study decided to collect the nearly 15 years worth of raw data and transform it for secondary reuse.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Qualitative Election Study of Britain Party Leader Evaluations \nDatabase, 2005-2024"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Qualitative Election Study of Britain Party Leader Evaluations \nDatabase, 2005-2024"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/qualitative-election-study-of-britain-party-leader-evaluations-database-2005-2024"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Qualitative Election Study of Britain Party Leader Evaluations \nDatabase, 2005-2024"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Qualitative Election Study of Britain Party Leader Evaluations \nDatabase, 2005-2024"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
