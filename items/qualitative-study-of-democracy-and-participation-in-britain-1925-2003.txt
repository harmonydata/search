The semi-structured interviews were conducted with the use of an interview schedule comprising a number of topics to ensure some similarity across the sample. First, under the topic `about yourself’, the interviewees were asked some biographical questions such as marital status, family, education and job. Second, under the topic `where you live’, the interviewees were asked about their localities and the extent to which they trusted people around them.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Qualitative Study of Democracy and Participation in Britain, 1925-2003"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$15"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Qualitative Study of Democracy and Participation in Britain, 1925-2003"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/qualitative-study-of-democracy-and-participation-in-britain-1925-2003"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Qualitative Study of Democracy and Participation in Britain, 1925-2003"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Qualitative Study of Democracy and Participation in Britain, 1925-2003"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
