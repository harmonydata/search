Four population areas in Northern England and Wales were targeted for this study. The quantitative data set included 62 questionnaires from a separate sample of national homeworkers. 

Key findings suggest that homeworking is differentiated by gender role, type of work and expectations. Furthermore there are both positive and negative aspects to the homeworking experience for all homeworkers. For example, flexibility is desired and enjoyed but this brings longer working hours. Finally, home is enhanced for some and invaded for others, but most make a conscious effort to make working from home viable. The qualitative interviews cover paid work done at home, how the interviewee began homeworking, location in the home used for work, how family/partner copes with interviewee's home work, enjoyment of homeworking, choice of other jobs outside the home, positive and negative aspects of homeworking, perception of how treated in comparison to other workers, structure of typical working day, separation of work and home life, leisure time activities, breaks from work, local neighbourhood, perceptions of home and changes brought on by working from home.

Variables in the quantitative data file include interviewee number (the 45 interviews may be linked by number to the respondent information in the data file), age, gender, rural/urban location, type of work, employment status, employment details and sector, hours of work, employment and homeworking history, living arrangements and household, children and childcare, computer use, community access, ways of working from home, comparison with other ways of working and work locus of control.
