The global literature on retrofit and carbon reduction will also be reviewed to identify gaps and tends.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Quantifying Carbon Reduction from Existing Buildings: Classification of 1,050 Abstracts of Global Peer Reviewed Journal Articles, 2017-2024"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Quantifying Carbon Reduction from Existing Buildings: Classification of 1,050 Abstracts of Global Peer Reviewed Journal Articles, 2017-2024"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/quantifying-carbon-reduction-from-existing-buildings-classification-of-1-050-abstracts-of-global-peer-reviewed-journal-articles-2017-2024"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Quantifying Carbon Reduction from Existing Buildings: Classification of 1,050 Abstracts of Global Peer Reviewed Journal Articles, 2017-2024"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Quantifying Carbon Reduction from Existing Buildings: Classification of 1,050 Abstracts of Global Peer Reviewed Journal Articles, 2017-2024"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
