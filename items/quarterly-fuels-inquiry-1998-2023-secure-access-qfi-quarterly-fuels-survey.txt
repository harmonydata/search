 Respondents to QFI are asked to provide the volume and value of fuel purchased in the preceding quarter. Data are collected on: coal, coke, medium fuel oil, heavy fuel oil, gas oil, liquefied petroleum gas, electricity and firm and interruptible gas, although not all respondents use all these fuels. The data are then used to calculate a unit cost for each fuel used by size of user (for the more common used fuels) and an overall average.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Quarterly Fuels Inquiry, 1998-2023: Secure Access / QFI; Quarterly Fuels Survey"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Quarterly Fuels Inquiry, 1998-2023: Secure Access / QFI; Quarterly Fuels Survey"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/quarterly-fuels-inquiry-1998-2023-secure-access-qfi-quarterly-fuels-survey"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Quarterly Fuels Inquiry, 1998-2023: Secure Access / QFI; Quarterly Fuels Survey"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Quarterly Fuels Inquiry, 1998-2023: Secure Access / QFI; Quarterly Fuels Survey"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
