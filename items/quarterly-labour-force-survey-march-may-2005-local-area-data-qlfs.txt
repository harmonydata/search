LFS move from seasonal to calendar quarters
In accordance with EU regulations, the LFS moved from seasonal (spring, summer, autumn, winter) quarters to calendar quarters (January-March, April-June, July-September, October-December) in 2006. The last seasonal Local Area Data dataset issued was the Quarterly Labour Force Survey, December 2005 - February, 2006: Local Area Data (SN 5392), and the first calendar quarter dataset was the Quarterly Labour Force Survey, January - March, 2006: Local Area Data (SN 5393). Users should note that there is some overlap between these two datasets. Further information on the seasonal to calendar quarter change and its impact on LFS data may be found in the following online article:
