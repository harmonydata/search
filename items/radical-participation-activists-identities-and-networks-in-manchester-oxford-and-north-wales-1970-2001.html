Quantitative and qualitative methodologies were used.  Forms (repertoires), levels, targets and rationales of direct action were surveyed, with local levels of activity giving an indication of national patterns. The investigators noted how repertoires of action were affected by structural and cultural variables, how they were diffused across activist generations, and also how such repertoires were adapted, rejected or simply forgotten by younger activists as the movement built its &#x27;capacity&#x27;.

Networks were a key concept in this study. The UK direct action movement is comprised of a series of fluid, autonomous and biodegradable networks, which are generally &#x27;submerged&#x27;, emerging into public consciousness during peaks in &#x27;cycles of contention&#x27;. The study examined the relationship between this &#x27;submerged&#x27; movement activity and its public protest. This included looking at how activist communities are sustained over time through social networks, radical counter-culture and often more &#x27;conventional&#x27; activity such as acquiring funds for Green centres.  Ties with external groups were also significant. Whilst the pattern of such cross-movement networking was affected by variables like locality (North Wales and Oxford activists had more &#x27;weak ties&#x27; to &#x27;conventional&#x27; campaign actors than Manchester ones), generally all three activist communities had more extra-movement ties than was generally supposed. The boundaries of the &#x27;radical direct action movement&#x27; were very blurred, with &#x27;conventional&#x27; and &#x27;radical&#x27; activists often supporting and resourcing each others&#x27; campaigns/actions, and participating in shared activity outside of confrontational action.

The research showed that such patterns of network crossover existed in previous activist generations in the 1970s and 80s.  The study also examined the extent of crossover between activist generations. One conclusion was that many of the characteristics attributed to new networks of protest against globalisation had roots in previous generations of direct action groups.
 This mixed methods study includes:
transcripts of 57 semi-structured qualitative interviews with activists; topics covered include: age, involvement in environmental direct action, meeting places and centres that have sustained direct action, to what extent the area was good for taking direct action, how personal activity has changed, social background, life history and environment, school and work, cultural and ideological reference systems, membership/activity of organisations, environmental concern, direct action and the state, approach to other environmental groups and lifestyle

Quantitative and qualitative methodologies were used.  Forms (repertoires), levels, targets and rationales of direct action were surveyed, with local levels of activity giving an indication of national patterns.

The UK direct action movement is comprised of a series of fluid, autonomous and biodegradable networks, which are generally 'submerged', emerging into public consciousness during peaks in 'cycles of contention'. The study examined the relationship between this 'submerged' movement activity and its public protest. This included looking at how activist communities are sustained over time through social networks, radical counter-culture and often more 'conventional' activity such as acquiring funds for Green centres.  Ties with external groups were also significant. Whilst the pattern of such cross-movement networking was affected by variables like locality (North Wales and Oxford activists had more 'weak ties' to 'conventional' campaign actors than Manchester ones), generally all three activist communities had more extra-movement ties than was generally supposed. The boundaries of the 'radical direct action movement' were very blurred, with 'conventional' and 'radical' activists often supporting and resourcing each others' campaigns/actions, and participating in shared activity outside of confrontational action.\\n\\nThe research showed that such patterns of network crossover existed in previous activist generations in the 1970s and 80s.
