The results are of interest, however, to social planners, sociologists and students of Europe as well as to marketing organizations.  The survey, carried out in 16 western European countries in 1969, was intended to up-date and extend the coverage of the 1963 Products and People survey (Survey Number 1511). Coverage was expanded to cover all the countries of EFTA as well as Finland, Spain and the Republic of Ireland. Like the 1963 study, this survey was intended primarily to be a marketing survey of western European countries, to measure these countries' differences as consumers over a wide range of goods and services, and to see how subscribers to the Reader's Digest compared against the total population of each country. However, a number of other broader attitudinal questions have been added, as in 1963, which give the survey a much wider relevance and potential audience than might otherwise be expected. Apart from measuring these and ownership of more than 200 consumer goods and services, information was also collected about the people and families of Europe and their attitudes over a wide range of topics.
