The dataset contains information about the records in the Public Record Office series  E 179 relating to the six counties of Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire and Oxfordshire. It gives the reference of each document, its document type, its date, the tax to which it relates, and the name and type of any settlement units paying tax whose names are recorded in it, with an internal reference showing where they occur in the document.

Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Records of Central Government Taxation in England, c.1190-1690; Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire and Oxfordshire"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Records of Central Government Taxation in England, c.1190-1690; Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire and Oxfordshire"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/records-of-central-government-taxation-in-england-c-1190-1690-bedfordshire-berkshire-buckinghamshire-cambridgeshire-huntingdonshire-and-oxfordshire"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Records of Central Government Taxation in England, c.1190-1690; Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire and Oxfordshire"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Records of Central Government Taxation in England, c.1190-1690; Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire and Oxfordshire"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
