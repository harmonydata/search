based policy making that tackles inequalities in arts and cultural provision for healthy ageing outcomes.
The project will involve an interdisciplinary team working alongside the cultural sector, creative technology partners and
communities of 'next generation' older people (i.e. aged 60-75 years) to understand older people's experiences of digital
exclusion, and what they value culturally and socially. This knowledge will then inform the co-design of digitally driven
cultural experiences that 'support social connections'. The research will involve designing a new tool to measure the impact
of digital cultural experiences on social connectivity for healthy ageing. The audience research will enable new
understandings of digitally experienced cultural value, that takes account of older age and inequalities.18:T1280,This research project tackled the complex problem of how to increase participation in social and cultural life for all as we age which has been shown to make a vital contribution to raising quality of life. The project addressed the fundamental issue that arts and cultural participation drops dramatically in older populations and that disabled, Black, Asian and minority ethnic and older people living in poverty are even less likely to participate. It tackled inequalities related to accessibility and content of digital arts and cultural provision, enabled vital R&D and established new business models to encourage digital innovation in the arts and cultural sector to support healthy ageing. 

The project included exploration of the everyday lives of minoritized older adults. Throughout the project methods of doing co-design with minoritized older adults were designed. The project worked alongside older adults, creative industry players and community sector and cultural sector organisations to co-design digital arts and cultural experiences that support social connections and contribute to improved quality of life for older adults.

It supported creative industries to build a better understanding of diverse older audiences and to robustly evaluate their offer; and provided new evidence based policy making that sought to tackle inequalities in arts and cultural provision for healthy ageing outcomes.

This data set includes Interviews held towards the end of the Connecting through Culture as we Age research project. The interviews were a point of reflection on the participation of older adult co-researchers and partners reflecting on co-design in Connecting through Culture as we Age. The project recruited 20 minoritised older adults who identified as disabled, socioeconomically and/or racially minoritised and worked with them through the 3 years of the project which involved creative, participatory design based methods. The project funded 6 prototype teams that emerged during the project and included older adult co-researchers. We worked closely with community and cultural sector organisations throughout the co-design process.This research project tackles the complex problem of how to increase participation in social and cultural life for all as we
age which has been shown to make a vital contribution to raising quality of life. The project will address the fundamental
issue that arts and cultural participation drops dramatically in older populations and that disabled, Black, Asian and minority
ethnic and older people living in poverty are even less likely to participate. It will tackle inequalities related to accessibility
and content of digital arts and cultural provision, enable vital R&D and establish new business models to encourage digital
innovation in the arts and cultural sector to support healthy ageing. Arts and cultural organisations have been slow to adopt
digital innovation, but there is huge potential in using emerging technologies to enable diversification of content and build
new older audiences. The pandemic has increased the urgency to harness digital technologies to enhance the accessibility
and content of cultural participation so that those who are socially isolated may be able to benefit, increasing their quality of
life.
The impact of the project will be include: disabled, Black, Asian and minority ethnic and older audiences living in poverty
participating in digital arts and cultural experiences that will support their social connections and contribute to improved
quality of life; provision of vital R&D support for collaborations between cultural and technology sectors in designing digital
innovations, helping them prosper and thus contributing to regional and national sectoral growth; supporting creative
industries to build a better understanding of diverse older audiences and to robustly evaluate their offer; and new evidence
based policy making that tackles inequalities in arts and cultural provision for healthy ageing outcomes.
