1b:T1207,During 1998, in line with other European Union (EU) member states, the UK adopted the new European System of Accounts (ESA 95), to be used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for the production of financial data. In September 1998 the UK National Accounts were published for the first time using ESA95. Under this system, ONS is required to compile more detailed regional economic information than was previously the case and now produces regional Gross Value Added (GVA - formerly Gross Domestic Product or GDP, to which some series still refer), regional Household Accounts and regional Gross Fixed Capital Formation. Most Regional Accounts data are now consistent with ESA95 - users should refer to the information in the 'Main Topics' section below, and the documentation. 
Regional Accounts data are compiled mainly from the UK National Accounts (Blue Book), the New Earnings Survey (NES) and the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI 2).

For the 8th edition (December 2002), data files covering Gross Value Added (GVA - formerly GDP) by GOR, Industry, Manufacturing Class and other tables were added to the dataset. On 10th December 2002, however, ONS withdrew the 8th edition GVA data files, due to errors discovered in the data.

  PART I: Regional Gross Value Added (GVA - formerly GDP) up to 1998/1999  - European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95) basis.
