What are the economic impacts of Brexit on the UK's sectors, regions and cities? 
The findings from our recent research suggest that the UK's cities and regions which voted for Brexit are also the most economically dependent on EU markets for their prosperity and viability. This is a result of their differing sectoral and trade composition. Different impacts are likely for different sectors, and also different impacts are likely between sectors, and these relationships also differ across the country's regions. Some sectors, some regions and some cities will be more sensitive and susceptible to any changes in UK-EU trade relations which may arise from Brexit than others and their long-run competiveness positions will be less robust and more vulnerable than others.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"dataset":{"title":"Regional Stakeholders Workshops Sessions and Interviews Transcripts, 2018","description":"$15","image":"$undefined","publisher":"$undefined","funders":"$undefined","geographicCoverage":"GB, IE, NL","temporalCoverage":"2017-04-01/2019-06-30","ageCoverage":"$undefined","studyDesign":[],"resourceType":"dataset","topics":["BREXIT","STAKEHOLDERS","REGIONS","VALUE CHAINS","ADVANCED MANUFACTURING","LEVELLING UP","SERVICES"],"instruments":[],"dataCatalogs":[{"name":"UK Data Service","url":"https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=854978","logo":"$undefined"}],"matchedVariables":[],"allVariables":[],"additionalLinks":["https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=854978","https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/854978","http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-854978","http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-854978"],"child_datasets":[],"aiSummary":null}}]]

What are the economic impacts of Brexit on the UK's sectors, regions and cities? 
The findings from our recent research suggest that the UK's cities and regions which voted for Brexit are also the most economically dependent on EU markets for their prosperity and viability. This is a result of their differing sectoral and trade composition. Different impacts are likely for different sectors, and also different impacts are likely between sectors, and these relationships also differ across the country's regions. Some sectors, some regions and some cities will be more sensitive and susceptible to any changes in UK-EU trade relations which may arise from Brexit than others and their long-run competiveness positions will be less robust and more vulnerable than others.17:T12c1,Regional Stakeholders Workshops Sessions and Interviews Transcripts comprising the following workshops: (1) Brexit Devolved Administrations in Edinburgh, 4 May 2018; (2) Brexit and Advanced Manufacturing Industries in Birmingham, 11 May 2018; (3) Brexit and Service Industries in London, 18th May 2018 and (4) Brexit and Devolution, Leeds, 21st May 2018.
