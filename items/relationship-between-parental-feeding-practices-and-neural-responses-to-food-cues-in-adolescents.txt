This dataset contains the T1 and EPI data and EVs (regressors) and design files for use in FSL and that describe the timing of the experiment for each participant. It also contains a spv file of all behavioural data.This project was designed to examine (i) the effects of parental feeding practices on brain responses to food in adolescents with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), obese and normal weight control adolescents; (ii) how these associated responses relate to eating behaviour and management of diabetes. The project also aimed to we also examine the locations of structural abnormalites using Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) and Tract -Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and whether they are linked to eating behaviour, but these data are not part of this dataset.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"The relationship between parental feeding practices and neural responses to food cues in adolescents\n"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"The relationship between parental feeding practices and neural responses to food cues in adolescents\n"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/relationship-between-parental-feeding-practices-and-neural-responses-to-food-cues-in-adolescents"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"The relationship between parental feeding practices and neural responses to food cues in adolescents\n"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The relationship between parental feeding practices and neural responses to food cues in adolescents\n"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
