 The dataset comprises 125 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with respondents who had a professional or personal interest in local and regional foods.  The interviews were conducted in three consecutive phases (labelled 2-4 below, phase 1 being a review).  Interviews in each phase were conducted simultaneously in both regions covered.  

Phase 2 of the research examined the regional and local policy environments for food relocalisation through interviews with 45 regional policy strategists, county council and local government employees (e.g. planners, economic and tourism development officers), representatives of membership bodies and representatives of non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

Phase 3 comprised interviews with 40 farmers, food and drink processors and retailers, all of which were small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs).  The interviews covered perceptions of the Processing and Marketing Grant and Rural Enterprise Scheme (food-related measures only) of the England Rural Development Programme; development control; the role of networking for the entrepreneur; and attitudes to the production of high quality food and drink. 

Phase 4 comprised interviews with 40 consumers of local food, recruited at selected premises of phase 3 interviewees.  Interviewees were asked about their food shopping behaviour and to discuss the factors that inform their food purchasing behaviour.27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2c"}]
