 The present project will address an important biosocial question and benefit from cross-disciplinary research methods. By the end of the research we will have developed a better understanding of how memory for recent eating influences food consumption and examined the applied relevance of this new knowledge. These novel insights will have the potential to help tackle the widespread obesity problem faced by the majority of the developed world.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Remembered meal satisfaction and later snack food intake: A laboratory study 2016-2018"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Remembered meal satisfaction and later snack food intake: A laboratory study 2016-2018"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/remembered-meal-satisfaction-and-later-snack-food-intake-a-laboratory-study-2016-2018"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Remembered meal satisfaction and later snack food intake: A laboratory study 2016-2018"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Remembered meal satisfaction and later snack food intake: A laboratory study 2016-2018"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
