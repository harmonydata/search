These data were generated from the second field trial, established by the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) in conjunction with the Renewable Heat Premium Payment (RHPP) grant scheme, which ran from 2011-2014 (note that the data included here cover the period October 2013-March 2015). Please note that this study contains the cleaned data - a raw version is available under SN 7955. See the RAPID-HPC statement below for information on data quality.

The RHPP policy provided subsidies for private householders, Registered Social Landlords and communities to install renewable heat measures in residential properties. Eligible measures included air and ground-source heat pumps, biomass boilers and solar thermal panels. Around 14,000 heat pumps were installed via this scheme. DECC (now BEIS) funded a detailed monitoring campaign, which covered 700 heat pumps (around 5% of the total). The aim of this monitoring campaign was to provide data to enable an assessment of the efficiencies of the heat pumps and to gain greater insight into their performance. The RHPP scheme was administered by the Energy Savings Trust (EST) who engaged the Buildings Research Establishment (BRE) to run the meter installation and data collection phases of the monitoring program. They collected data from 31 October 2013 to 31 March 2015. RHPP heat pumps were installed between 2009 and 2014. Since the start of the RHPP Scheme, the installation requirements set by MCS standards and processes have been updated. Further information about the RHPP scheme (which has now closed), including statistics, can be found on the Gov.uk Renewable Heat Premium Payment scheme statistics webpage.

DECC contracted the RAPID-HPC to analyse these data. The data provided to RAPID-HPC included physical monitoring data, and metadata describing the features of the heat pump installations and the dwellings in which they were installed. As the analysis has progressed, limitations with the underlying data have been identified. See RAPID-HPC&#x27;s statement (below). (See also SN 7955 for a raw version of the data.)

RAPID-HPC&#x27;s Statement on Data Anomalies and Interpretation, February 2016 (covered in the Detailed Analysis of Data Report and the spreadsheets included with this study)
The work of the RAPID-HPC consisted of cleaning the data, selection of sites and data for analysis, analysis, and the development of conclusions and interpretations. The monitoring data and contextual information are imperfect. Discussion of the data limitations are provided in the DECC Detailed analysis of data from heat pumps installed via the Renewable Heat Premium Payment Scheme report on the gov.uk website which is essential to the understanding of this data. RAPID-HPC has used a top-down rules-based approach to identifying data anomalies to clean the data. The advantages of this approach are that it is transparent and replicable and enables analysis of the very large (over 0.5 billion data points) dataset as a whole. It is important to note that the data was collected from domestic heat pumps installed via the RHPP policy. [RAPID-HPC] have not assessed the degree to which the heat pumps assessed are representative of the general sample of domestic heat pumps in the UK. Therefore, results from any analysis undertaken using these data should not be assumed to be representative of any other sample of heat pumps.

Downloading the data - using suitable zip software
Users should note that the download zip file for this study is over 1GB in size. The standard Windows system zip compression software is not able to unzip a file of this size completely and may mean that problems are encountered with some of the data or documentation files. Therefore, it is recommended that users install one of the following software packages in order to unzip the file: 7zip (free open source software for Windows, check 7zip website for Linux/Unix); WinZip (free to try for Windows and Mac); iZip (free software for Mac). The data cover a number of technical parameters from monitoring heat pump systems (such as flow temperature, heat output) in timeseries form (2-minutely data) for each of the monitored sites. Heat pump efficiencies (such as Seasonal Performance Factor) can be calculated from the variables present."/><meta property="og:title" content="Renewable Heat Premium Payment Scheme: Heat Pump Monitoring: Cleaned Data, 2013-2015 / RHPP"/><meta property="og:description" content="The need to develop the UK supply for domestic heat pumps (HPs) and to evaluate the empirical performance of HP systems in the field has led to the establishment of two major UK field trials of HPs (the first one took place between 2008 and 2012).

performance of HP systems in the field has led to the establishment of two major UK field trials of HPs (the first one took place between 2008 and 2012). These data were generated from the second field trial, established by the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) in conjunction with the Renewable Heat Premium Payment (RHPP) grant scheme, which ran from 2011-2014 (note that the data included here cover the period October 2013-March 2015).

See the RAPID-HPC statement below for information on data quality.\\n\\nThe RHPP policy provided subsidies for private householders, Registered Social Landlords and communities to install renewable heat measures in residential properties. Eligible measures included air and ground-source heat pumps, biomass boilers and solar thermal panels. Around 14,000 heat pumps were installed via this scheme. DECC (now BEIS) funded a detailed monitoring campaign, which covered 700 heat pumps (around 5% of the total). The aim of this monitoring campaign was to provide data to enable an assessment of the efficiencies of the heat pumps and to gain greater insight into their performance. The RHPP scheme was administered by the Energy Savings Trust (EST) who engaged the Buildings Research Establishment (BRE) to run the meter installation and data collection phases of the monitoring program. They collected data from 31 October 2013 to 31 March 2015. RHPP heat pumps were installed between 2009 and 2014.

Heat pump efficiencies (such as Seasonal Performance Factor) can be calculated from the variables present."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"10:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Renewable Heat Premium Payment Scheme: Heat Pump Monitoring: Cleaned Data, 2013-2015 / RHPP\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"$18\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"3\",{\"property\":\"og:title\",\"content\":\"Renewable Heat Premium Payment Scheme: Heat Pump Monitoring: Cleaned Data, 2013-2015 / RHPP\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"4\",{\"property\":\"og:description\",\"content\":\"$19\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"5\",{\"property\":\"og:url\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/renewable-heat-premium-payment-scheme-heat-pump-monitoring-cleaned-data-2013-2015-rhpp\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"6\",{\"property\":\"og:site_name\",\"content\":\"Academic Resource Discovery\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"7\",{\"property\":\"og:locale\",\"content\":\"en_US\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"8\",{\"property\":\"og:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"9\",{\"property\":\"og:image:width\",\"content\":\"1200\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"10\",{\"property\":\"og:image:height\",\"content\":\"630\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"11\",{\"property\":\"og:image:alt\",\"content\":\"Renewable Heat Premium Payment Scheme: Heat Pump Monitoring: Cleaned Data, 2013-2015 / RHPP\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"12\",{\"property\":\"og:type\",\"content\":\"website\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"13\",{\"name\":\"twitter:card\",\"content\":\"summary_large_image\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:title\",\"content\":\"Renewable Heat Premium Payment Scheme: Heat Pump Monitoring: Cleaned Data, 2013-2015 / RHPP\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$1a\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"16\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}],[\"$\",\"link\",\"17\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:null\n"])</script></body></html>
