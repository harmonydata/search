As well as offering impartial independent explanations of the legal frameworks that apply across a number of key policy areas, the programme will also undertake new research on the way the interests and concerns of the devolved powers may be fed into the EU decision making process. This is through an investigation into the recently acquired powers for national parliaments to make representations to the EU Commission that proposed laws should be handled at a national or regional level instead of at EU level, as their objectives can be achieved without the need for EU legislation. The research will explore how this 'subsidiarity review' is operating within the UK, looking at the relationship between the Welsh Assembly, the other devolved parliaments, and the UK Parliament.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Repatriation of competences from the European Union 2015-2018"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Repatriation of competences from the European Union 2015-2018"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/repatriation-of-competences-from-the-european-union-2015-2018"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Repatriation of competences from the European Union 2015-2018"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Repatriation of competences from the European Union 2015-2018"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
