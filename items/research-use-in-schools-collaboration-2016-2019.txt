Led by Prof. Qing Gu, University College London (available at https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/RS_Evaluation.pdf). 7) A review of the functions and work of the UK’s What Works Centres. Led by Prof. David Gough (available at https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=3731)In this project, we commissioned a portfolio of research on research use in education. This includes: a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) evaluation of different approaches to disseminating and communicating research evidence; developing a quantifiable measure of research engagement in schools; evaluating different models to scaling-up evidence-informed practice (e.g building capacity of knowledge broker intermediaries); and, piloting a behavioural approach to designing Knowledge Mobilisation strategies
In addition to the work in education we conduced a review of the functions and work of the UK’s What Works Centres.
Given the paucity of research examining knowledge mobilisation (KM) in social practice, we anticipate the findings will be of interest to a wide range of organisations involved in engaging users with evidence, across a range of different sectors. Practitioners and intermediaries should find interest in those projects investigating how to build capacity to use evidence and integrate it into practice. Policy makers will be particularly interested in different models to scaling-up evidence-based approaches, as well as the cost-effectiveness of different strategies. The Knowledge Mobilisation (KM) research community may find interest in the insights on research use and in methodological developments.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Research Use in Schools Collaboration, 2016-2019"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Research Use in Schools Collaboration, 2016-2019"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/research-use-in-schools-collaboration-2016-2019"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Research Use in Schools Collaboration, 2016-2019"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Research Use in Schools Collaboration, 2016-2019"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
