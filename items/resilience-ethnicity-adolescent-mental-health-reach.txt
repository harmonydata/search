Conducted in the London boroughs of Lambeth, Southwark, and Croydon, the study involves large, ethnically diverse cohorts of secondary school students. The primary aim is to explore how social, psychological, and biological factors contribute to the development and persistence of mental health issues over time. By examining these risk and protective factors, REACH seeks to identify critical periods and effective strategies for intervention to enhance mental health and wellbeing in young people. The study's findings are expected to provide valuable insights into the timing and nature of interventions that can support adolescent mental health, particularly in diverse urban settings."}}]]
