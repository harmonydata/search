Previous research in Vietnam has taken a largely technical approach to the relationship between mangrove protection, restoration and aquaculture and has not paid adequate attention to socio-economic factors. This research aims to evaluate socio-ecological resilience in Vietnamese mangroves in the Red River Delta and evaluate management options to enhance delivery of benefits and services across multiple scales, using an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates ecology; remote sensing and GIS; and social research methods on livelihoods and scenario evaluation. By doing so, this research will contribute to a) the livelihoods and resilience of mangrove dependent communities, b) the on-going delivery of ecosystem services across scales, while at the same time c) through stakeholder engagement and knowledge exchange throughout, building the capacity for conservation and sustainable management of mangroves in Vietnam.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Resilient Mangrove Systems: Questionnaires, Participatory GIS, and Focus Groups in Mangrove Socio-ecological Systems in the Red River Delta, Vietnam, 2018-2019"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Resilient Mangrove Systems: Questionnaires, Participatory GIS, and Focus Groups in Mangrove Socio-ecological Systems in the Red River Delta, Vietnam, 2018-2019"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/resilient-mangrove-systems-questionnaires-participatory-gis-and-focus-groups-in-mangrove-socio-ecological-systems-in-the-red-river-delta-vietnam-2018"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Resilient Mangrove Systems: Questionnaires, Participatory GIS, and Focus Groups in Mangrove Socio-ecological Systems in the Red River Delta, Vietnam, 2018-2019"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Resilient Mangrove Systems: Questionnaires, Participatory GIS, and Focus Groups in Mangrove Socio-ecological Systems in the Red River Delta, Vietnam, 2018-2019"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
