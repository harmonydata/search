The researchers also engaged in extensive participant observation in eight open youth work settings around England (youth clubs, detached / street-based youth work, and youth work aimed at specific groups e.g. trans young people, girls, boys). The study aims to find out how the youth impact agenda is implemented in practice, and how impact processes are experienced and perceived by young people and youth workers. Interviews include the perspectives of policy makers and influencers in the UK and USA, to explore how and why 'youth impact' has become so important at this time.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Rethinking Impact, Evaluation and Accountability in Youth Work, 2018-2021"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Rethinking Impact, Evaluation and Accountability in Youth Work, 2018-2021"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/rethinking-impact-evaluation-and-accountability-in-youth-work-2018-2021"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Rethinking Impact, Evaluation and Accountability in Youth Work, 2018-2021"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Rethinking Impact, Evaluation and Accountability in Youth Work, 2018-2021"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
