Such migration is commonly associated with peripheral and scenically attractive areas. Accordingly, the project focuses on rural areas of Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland.

It has two main aims – to examine the retirement transition concept and to evaluate its consequences for an ageing society, individual migrants and rural destination communities.

The methodology involves four main stages. First, an analysis of Census datasets to explore the migration patterns of the 50-64 age cohort. Second, a household survey and migrant interviews to examine the characteristics, origins, decision-making processes, and consequences associated with pre-retirement and other migration flows. Third, a postal survey of non-movers. Fourth, interviews with selected local service providers and local and national policy-makers to consider the implications of retirement transition migration on an ageing society and for the social and economic well-being of rural communities.28:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2c"}]
