The objective was revised to include a survey of all outbreaks reported six months following site visits.
  The project took place between 1997-1999. The methods included in-depth interviews at five case study sites; telephone surveys of outbreaks in the six months following the site interviews; and a national postal survey. We do not hold the raw data for the telephone survey at the UK Data Archive, but there is a summary of the results in the documentation.
Case studies - The case studies examined the arrangements for managing the risks of infectious disease in five health districts. A purposive sampling technique was used to select sites that included large conurbations and county towns; and district general hospitals and specialist teaching hospitals. The data set contains transcripts or notes from 35 interviews. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted between November 1997 - November 1998 with Consultants in Communicable Disease Control (CsCDC) and Directors of Public Health (DsPH) in health authorities, Infection Control Doctors (ICDs) and Infection Control Nurses (ICNs) in Trusts, and financial officers (or others with a major role in contracting). 
National Survey - A survey of all CsCDC, ICDs and ICNs in England was conducted. Questionnaires, based on the interviews at the study sites, were designed for each professional group. The data set includes a data file, containing numeric responses, and a text file containing qualitative responses, for each professional group.27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2c"}]
