4.	A study investigating the relationship between PAL and reading in 97 children aged 8 to 10 years. This study used six different PAL tasks to identify two distinct but correlated types of PAL; those involving auditory-articulatory associations and those involving visual-articulatory associations. Importantly, we showed that auditory-articulatory PAL was the stronger predictor of reading, providing evidence that the relationship between PAL and reading is driven by verbal, rather than visual-verbal, demands.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"The role of automatic letter-speech sound integration in reading development and dyslexia 2015-2017"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"The role of automatic letter-speech sound integration in reading development and dyslexia 2015-2017"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/role-of-automatic-letter-speech-sound-integration-in-reading-development-and-dyslexia-2015-2017"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"The role of automatic letter-speech sound integration in reading development and dyslexia 2015-2017"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The role of automatic letter-speech sound integration in reading development and dyslexia 2015-2017"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
