Industry analysts are analysed here as 'Promissory Organisations' to reflect the fact they are highly successful in mobilising promise and expectations amongst supplier and user communities. However, the critical social sciences are unable to explain satisfactorily the influence of this kind of knowledge, which has either been ignored or described as 'simplistic' and 'flawed'. To this purpose, the Fellowship will pursue a theoretically informed and empirically grounded programme of work into this important but neglected group of experts, which will move towards a productive understanding of the influence and limitations of industry analysts and IT research firms.27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2b"}]
