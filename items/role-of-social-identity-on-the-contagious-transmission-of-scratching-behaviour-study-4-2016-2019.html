However, the failure to explain the apparent group-boundaries present in ‘passive’ social influence invites an explanation for behaviours incorporating social identification. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying contagious scratching. That it might be the result of ‘mere exposure’ was previously accepted in much contagion research, but this idea has since been shown to be insufficient in explaining the spread of behaviour. More complete explanations of contagious behaviour take into account the social context. Using theories such as Social Identity Theory and Self-Categorisation theory, social explanations of contagion suggest that the spread of behaviour is limited by social identification processes. This explanation has been successfully applied in the study of contagious behaviours during large scale crowd events but has never been applied to the study of everyday contagious behaviour such as scratching. This study attempts to bridge the gap in this research by applying an ingroup-outgroup manipulation to scratching behaviour. Participants (n= 38) where manipulated to have either a British (ingroup) identity or English (Outgroup) identity while observing a video of a Scottish man itching. It was hypothesised that having a shared social identity with the target would increase scratching behaviour, with identity strength used as a moderator. However, although the results show that strength of identification moderated the relationship between video watched (scratching vs no scratching) and self-reported itchiness, more scratching was reported in the outgroup condition.How and why do behaviours spread from person to person? In particular, how does aggression and violent behaviour spread? When, as in 2011, riots began in London, why did they then occur in Birmingham, Manchester, and Liverpool? One of the most common ways of addressing such issues is through the notion of &#x27;contagion&#x27;. The core idea is that, particularly in crowds, mere exposure to the behaviour of others leads observers to behave in the same way. &#x27;Contagion&#x27; is now used to explain everything from &#x27;basic&#x27; responses such as smiling and yawning (where the mere act of witnessing someone yawn or smile can invoke the same response in another) to complex phenomena like the behaviour of financial markets and, of course, rioting. What is more, laboratory experiments on the &#x27;contagion&#x27; of simple responses (such as yawning) serve to underpin the plausibility of &#x27;contagion&#x27; accounts as applied to complex phenomena (such as rioting).
Despite this widespread acceptance, the &#x27;contagion&#x27; account has major problems in explaining the spread of behaviours. In particular, there are boundaries to such spread. If men smile at a sexist joke, will feminists also smile in response to the men&#x27;s smiles? If people riot in one town, why is it that they also riot in some towns but not others? For example, in 2011, disturbances spread from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool but they did not spread to Sheffield, Leeds or Glasgow. 
&#x27;Contagion&#x27; explanations cannot answer such questions because they assume that transmission is automatic. They do not take account of the social relations between the transmitter and receiver. We propose a new account of behavioural transmission based on the social identity approach in social psychology. This suggests that influence processes are limited by group boundaries and group content: we are more influenced by ingroup members than by outgroup members, and we are more influenced by that which is consonant with rather than contradictory to group norms. The social identity approach is therefore ideally suited to explaining the social limits to influence, both for &#x27;basic&#x27; phenomena and rioting. 
In order to advance both theoretical understanding and practical interventions, our research will develop a social identity analysis of transmission processes at multiple levels. Accordingly, the aims and objectives of this research project are as follows: 
First, we will conduct a series of experimental studies on &#x27;basic&#x27; behaviours (yawning, itching) to examine whether the effects of being exposed to a behaviour depend on observers and actors being fellow ingroup members. We will also examine &#x27;complex&#x27; behaviours (aggression and rioting) to see if (1) observers are more influenced when the actors are ingroup members; (2) observers are more influenced by the responses of other observers when these are also ingroup members; (3) willingness to copy others depends upon whether their behaviour is consonant with observer group norms. Second, we will examine the spread of urban disorder during the 2011 English riots."/><meta property="og:title" content="The role of social identity on the &#x27;contagious&#x27; transmission of scratching behaviour: Study 4, 2016-2019"/><meta property="og:description" content="Research into ‘contagion’ has been applied to a range of different behaviours.

role of social identity on the 'contagious' transmission of scratching behaviour: Study 4, 2016-2019\",\"description\":\"Research into ‘contagion’ has been applied to a range of different behaviours. However, the failure to explain the apparent group-boundaries present in ‘passive’ social influence invites an explanation for behaviours incorporating social identification. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying contagious scratching. That it might be the result of ‘mere exposure’ was previously accepted in much contagion research, but this idea has since been shown to be insufficient in explaining the spread of behaviour. More complete explanations of contagious behaviour take into account the social context. Using theories such as Social Identity Theory and Self-Categorisation theory, social explanations of contagion suggest that the spread of behaviour is limited by social identification processes. This explanation has been successfully applied in the study of contagious behaviours during large scale crowd events but has never been applied to the study of everyday contagious behaviour such as scratching. This study attempts to bridge the gap in this research by applying an ingroup-outgroup manipulation to scratching behaviour. Participants (n= 38) where manipulated to have either a British (ingroup) identity or English (Outgroup) identity while observing a video of a Scottish man itching. It was hypothesised that having a shared social identity with the target would increase scratching behaviour, with identity strength used as a moderator. However, although the results show that strength of identification moderated the relationship between video watched (scratching vs no scratching) and self-reported itchiness, more scratching was reported in the outgroup condition.How and why do behaviours spread from person to person? In particular, how does aggression and violent behaviour spread? When, as in 2011, riots began in London, why did they then occur in Birmingham, Manchester, and Liverpool? One of the most common ways of addressing such issues is through the notion of 'contagion'. The core idea is that, particularly in crowds, mere exposure to the behaviour of others leads observers to behave in the same way. 'Contagion' is now used to explain everything from 'basic' responses such as smiling and yawning (where the mere act of witnessing someone yawn or smile can invoke the same response in another) to complex phenomena like the behaviour of financial markets and, of course, rioting. What is more, laboratory experiments on the 'contagion' of simple responses (such as yawning) serve to underpin the plausibility of 'contagion' accounts as applied to complex phenomena (such as rioting).\\nDespite this widespread acceptance, the 'contagion' account has major problems in explaining the spread of behaviours. In particular, there are boundaries to such spread. If men smile at a sexist joke, will feminists also smile in response to the men's smiles? If people riot in one town, why is it that they also riot in some towns but not others? For example, in 2011, disturbances spread from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool but they did not spread to Sheffield, Leeds or Glasgow. \\n'Contagion' explanations cannot answer such questions because they assume that transmission is automatic. They do not take account of the social relations between the transmitter and receiver. We propose a new account of behavioural transmission based on the social identity approach in social psychology. This suggests that influence processes are limited by group boundaries and group content: we are more influenced by ingroup members than by outgroup members, and we are more influenced by that which is consonant with rather than contradictory to group norms. The social identity approach is therefore ideally suited to explaining the social limits to influence, both for 'basic' phenomena and rioting. \\nIn order to advance both theoretical understanding and practical interventions, our research will develop a social identity analysis of transmission processes at multiple levels. Accordingly, the aims and objectives of this research project are as follows: \\nFirst, we will conduct a series of experimental studies on 'basic' behaviours (yawning, itching) to examine whether the effects of being exposed to a behaviour depend on observers and actors being fellow ingroup members. We will also examine 'complex' behaviours (aggression and rioting) to see if (1) observers are more influenced when the actors are ingroup members; (2) observers are more influenced by the responses of other observers when these are also ingroup members; (3) willingness to copy others depends upon whether their behaviour is consonant with observer group norms. Second, we will examine the spread of urban disorder during the 2011 English riots.\",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/role-of-social-identity-on-the-contagious-transmission-of-scratching-behaviour-study-4-2016-2019\",\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-853839\"],\"keywords\":[\"SOCIAL IDENTITY\",\"SOCIAL INFLUENCE\",\"SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY\",\"HUMAN BEHAVIOUR\",\"GROUP BEHAVIOUR\"],\"temporalCoverage\":\"2016-05-01/2019-04-30\"}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"c:[\"$\",\"$5\",null,{\"fallback\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":\"Loading...\"}],\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$L17\",null,{\"strategy\":\"beforeInteractive\",\"id\":\"structured-data\",\"type\":\"application/ld+json\",\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"$18\"}}],\"$L19\"]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1a:I[78977,[\"9692\",\"static/js/9692.83f9877c.js\",\"1828\",\"static/js/1828.31087444.js\",\"690\",\"static/js/690.e023e61b.js\",\"7133\",\"static/js/7133.521b2ecd.js\",\"9829\",\"static/js/9829.124a89b0.js\",\"867\",\"static/js/867.7f6bef5e.js\",\"2939\",\"static/js/2939.aa50df5c.js\",\"5183\",\"static/js/5183.9f1a7545.js\",\"5738\",\"static/js/5738.d28a9943.js\",\"3055\",\"static/js/3055.87b66c06.js\",\"8977\",\"static/js/8977.89625695.js\",\"6387\",\"static/js/app/items/%5Bslug%5D/page.cedc9485.js\"],\"default\"]\n1b:T12a4,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Research into ‘contagion’ has been applied to a range of different behaviours.

Participants (n= 38) where manipulated to have either a British (ingroup) identity or English (Outgroup) identity while observing a video of a Scottish man itching. It was hypothesised that having a shared social identity with the target would increase scratching behaviour, with identity strength used as a moderator. However, although the results show that strength of identification moderated the relationship between video watched (scratching vs no scratching) and self-reported itchiness, more scratching was reported in the outgroup condition.How and why do behaviours spread from person to person? In particular, how does aggression and violent behaviour spread? When, as in 2011, riots began in London, why did they then occur in Birmingham, Manchester, and Liverpool? One of the most common ways of addressing such issues is through the notion of 'contagion'. The core idea is that, particularly in crowds, mere exposure to the behaviour of others leads observers to behave in the same way. 'Contagion' is now used to explain everything from 'basic' responses such as smiling and yawning (where the mere act of witnessing someone yawn or smile can invoke the same response in another) to complex phenomena like the behaviour of financial markets and, of course, rioting. What is more, laboratory experiments on the 'contagion' of simple responses (such as yawning) serve to underpin the plausibility of 'contagion' accounts as applied to complex phenomena (such as rioting).\nDespite this widespread acceptance, the 'contagion' account has major problems in explaining the spread of behaviours. In particular, there are boundaries to such spread. If men smile at a sexist joke, will feminists also smile in response to the men's smiles? If people riot in one town, why is it that they also riot in some towns but not others? For example, in 2011, disturbances spread from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool but they did not spread to Sheffield, Leeds or Glasgow. \n'Contagion' explanations cannot answer such questions because they assume that transmission is automatic. They do not take account of the social relations between the transmitter and receiver. We propose a new account of behavioural transmission based on the social identity approach in social psychology. This suggests that influence processes are limited by group boundaries and group content: we are more influenced by ingroup members than by outgroup members, and we are more influenced by that which is consonant with rather than contradictory to group norms. The social identity approach is therefore ideally suited to explaining the social limits to influence, both for 'basic' phenomena and rioting. \nIn order to advance both theoretical understanding and practical interventions, our research will develop a social identity analysis of transmission processes at multiple levels. Accordingly, the aims and objectives of this research project are as follows: \nFirst, we will conduct a series of experimental studies on 'basic' behaviours (yawning, itching) to examine whether the effects of being exposed to a behaviour depend on observers and actors being fellow ingroup members. We will also examine 'complex' behaviours (aggression and rioting) to see if (1) observers are more influenced when the actors are ingroup members; (2) observers are more influenced by the responses of other observers when these are also ingroup members; (3) willingness to copy others depends upon whether their behaviour is consonant with observer group norms. Second, we will examine the spread of urban disorder during the 2011 English riots."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"29:[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$2e\"}]\n2a:[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}]\n2b:[\"$\",\"link\",\"16\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]\n2c:[\"$\",\"$L2f\",\"17\",{}]\n16:\"$10:metadata\"\n"])</script></body></html>
