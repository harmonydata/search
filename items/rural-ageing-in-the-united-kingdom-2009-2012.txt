The research is being carried out in six case study areas in South West England and Wales and addresses the following principal questions: (1) How and in what ways are older people connected to civic society in these rural settings? (2) What is the impact of this connectivity on older people's quality of life in rural areas? (3) How is later life experienced across diverse rural contexts and within subgroups of older people? (4) How can novel interdisciplinary approaches be used to capture and disseminate evidence about older people's participation in and contributions to rural civic society, ie, as a source of rural community capital?10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Rural ageing in the United Kingdom 2009-2012"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Rural ageing in the United Kingdom 2009-2012"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/rural-ageing-in-the-united-kingdom-2009-2012"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Rural ageing in the United Kingdom 2009-2012"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Rural ageing in the United Kingdom 2009-2012"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
