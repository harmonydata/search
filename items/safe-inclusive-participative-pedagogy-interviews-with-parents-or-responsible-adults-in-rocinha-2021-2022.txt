3. How can inclusive participative pedagogy become embedded and sustainable in communities, their formal and informal contexts, so as to support children's early learning?
4. Is there an economic case for inclusive participative pedagogy? If so, what are the relevant components and what are the short- and long-term costs and benefits?

Inclusive participative pedagogy is a novel concept, which this project will develop, test and challenge.10:{"metadata":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Safe, Inclusive, Participative Pedagogy: Interviews with Parents or Responsible Adults in Rocinha, 2021-2022"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"$1c"}],"$L1d","$L1e","$L1f","$L20","$L21","$L22","$L23","$L24","$L25","$L26","$L27","$L28","$L29","$L2a","$L2b","$L2c"],"error":null,"digest":"$undefined"}

2d:T12bd,This data set was created by the Brazilian country team as part of the "Safe, Inclusive Participative Pedagogy (SIPP): Improving Early Childhood Education in Fragile Contexts" research project.
 
 This data set is part of a series of data sets relating to this multi-country project. 
 
 The overall research questions of the project are:
 1. In what ways and how do current policies, systems and organisations support safe, inclusive participative pedagogy in these contexts? What are the tensions and how can they be resolved?
 2. What information, knowledge, support, partnerships and expertise can be mobilised to understand these contexts and the threats, assets and opportunities for early childhood learning, young children and their families?What are the findings from such mobilisation and their implications for developing and supporting safe, inclusive participative pedagogy?
 3. How can safe, inclusive participative pedagogy become imbedded and sustainable in communities, their formal and informal contexts, so as to support children’s early learning?
 4. Is there an economic case for safe, inclusive participative pedagogy? If so, what are the relevant components and what are the short- and long-term costs and benefits?
 
 The data set relates to research questions 1-3. It aims to explore the perspectives of senior staff working in early childhood development centers in the community of Rocinha in Rio de Janeiro. 
 
 16 interviews were conducted between December 2021 and April 2022. The interviewers were several researchers from the International Center for Research and Policy in Childhood (CIESPI). 
 
 The data submitted here are summaries (in English) of the original interviews, which were carried out in Portuguese. While the data here are summaries, they are very detailed. While translating from Portuguese, staff maintained all the main points.Early childhood is a critical period for all children. It has been conclusively recognised by research that this period is significant for young children's rights in the here and now, for children's future educational, economic and health outcomes, and ultimately societal flourishing. 

As attention to early childhood education increases, and governments across the world are moving to compulsory pre-school and early education, this is a pivotal moment for: a) understanding the challenges/opportunities for such provision in different cultural and political contexts; and b) radically rethinking future directions of early childhood education globally. We have significant questions to ask at this very time about the quality of learning experiences and professional support, how early childhood education can be culturally meaningful and appropriate, and ensuring it is affordable, inclusive and accessible. 

This project responds to an urgent research need within four overseas development countries - Brazil, Eswatini, South Africa, and the West Bank and Gaza -- where new provision models are emerging in fragile contexts experiencing violence, inequalities and concentrated poverty. It builds on the innovation of the Brazilian academic partner (the International Centre International Centre for Research and Policy on Childhood at PUC-RIO), who researched how to strengthen and increase safe places of early learning for young children in two low-income communities in Rio de Janeiro (2014-17). Expanding from this, the academic partners in Brazil, Eswatini, South Africa, the West Bank & Gaza, and the UK will identify and develop safe, inclusive participative pedagogy that is implementable in fragile contexts and sustainable for governments, communities and families. While differing in socio-economic and cultural contexts, all four partner countries are poised for early childhood education development through national policy, are experiencing implementation quandaries and have fragile settings due to extreme and pervasive violence, inequalities and/or poverty. 

To do so, the research will address these four questions:
1. In what ways and how do current policies, systems and organisations support inclusive participative pedagogy in fragile contexts? 
2. What information, knowledge, expertise can be mobilised to understand fragile contexts and the threats, assets and opportunities for early childhood learning, young children and their families? 
3. How can inclusive participative pedagogy become embedded and sustainable in communities, their formal and informal contexts, so as to support children's early learning?
4. Is there an economic case for inclusive participative pedagogy? If so, what are the relevant components and what are the short- and long-term costs and benefits?
