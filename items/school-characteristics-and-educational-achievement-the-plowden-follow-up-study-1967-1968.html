Continuity from Primary to Secondary School: information supplied to secondary schools about pupils; attempts to acclimatise juniors to future secondary schools; school involvement in parental choice of secondary school.
School-Parent Interaction: number of parental invitations to school and for what purpose; how invitations made; parental attendance records. Whether school provides (and in what form): booklet or newsletter on school for parents; information on kinds of educational principles and practices of school; advice on suitable reading and television viewing for parents. Whether school has parent-teacher association, steps taken to encourage parental involvement with school work at home, visits by staff to pupils&#x27; homes.
