FSM-eligibility is not a constant characteristic of an individual pupil, in the same way that sex or ethnicity usually are, but linked to the economy, and family circumstances, meaning that pupils might move in and out of FSM-eligibility over their school careers. It is a threshold characteristic, so we have discussed variation within FSM-eligibility. The project has also analysed longitudinal trends of segregation by poverty at school level.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"School Segregation Data Linked to Next Steps, Sweeps 1 to 8, 2003-2006"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"School Segregation Data Linked to Next Steps, Sweeps 1 to 8, 2003-2006"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/school-segregation-data-linked-to-next-steps-sweeps-1-to-8-2003-2006"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"School Segregation Data Linked to Next Steps, Sweeps 1 to 8, 2003-2006"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"School Segregation Data Linked to Next Steps, Sweeps 1 to 8, 2003-2006"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
