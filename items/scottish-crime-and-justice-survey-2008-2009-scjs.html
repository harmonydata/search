For further details of the scope and methodology of the SCJS, please see documentation. Information about the survey and links to publications may be found on the Scottish Government&#x27;s Scottish Crime and Justice Survey webpages.

Background and history of the SCJSPrevious surveys of victimisation in Scotland began with the Scottish components of the 1982 and 1988 sweeps of the British Crime Survey (BCS) (held at the Archive under SNs 4368 and 4599) The Scottish element of the 1988 BCS was also known as the Scottish Areas Crime Survey and coverage was limited in those early surveys to the areas south of the Caledonian Canal. From 2012, the BCS has been renamed the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) (held under GN 33174). 
The first independent Scotland-only crime survey was commissioned by the Scottish Office in 1993 under the title of the Scottish Crime Survey (SCS) and was followed by repeated sweeps in 1996 (both years held together under SN 3813), and again in 2000 (SN 4542) and 2003 (SN 5756). In 2004 the survey underwent both a name change, to the Scottish Crime and Victimisation Survey (SCVS) (SN 5757), and a major methodological change, with a move away from in-home face-to-face interviewing to telephone interviewing. However, the 2006 SCVS (SN 5784) returned to face-to-face interviewing after it was shown that the robustness of the data produced by the 2004 telephone survey could not be substantiated. From 2008-2009, the series name was changed to the present title, the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey, and it moved to a repeated annual cross-sectional schedule based on financial year. From 2012-13 the SCJS moved from annual to biennial survey covering the financial year however, the 2014-15 survey was the last biennial survey and currently the SCJS is conducted on an annual basis. See the documentation for further details.

Special Licence dataFrom 2012-13 only the Main Questionnaire data are available under standard End User Licence (EUL) agreement. The Victim Form and Self-Completion data are available under Special Licence (SL). The SL data have more restrictive access conditions than those made available under the standard EUL. Prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version.

SCJS 2008-2009:
The sample design for the SCJS 2008-2009 differed from those of the preceding SCVS and SCS surveys in a number of important respects. Firstly, its planned annual sample size of 16,000 interviews was considerably larger than before (for example the 2006 SCVS had a sample size of 5,000). Secondly, the required design had to obtain the equivalent of at least 1,000 simple random sample interviews in each Police Force Area (PFA). Lastly, whereas the previous surveys had completely clustered designs, the majority of the SCJS sample was un-clustered; clustering only occurred in the more sparsely populated &#x27;rural&#x27; areas of Scotland. Fieldwork for the 2008-2009 SCJS began in April 2008 and finished in March 2009, with a target of 1,333 interviews being conducted each calendar month. For further details, see documentation.

 The 2008-2009 SCJS questionnaire consisted of the following modules:Main questionnaire: demographic details, general views on crime and social issues, victim form screener victim form (repeated up to five times, based on information from the screeners section): incident details, perception of the offender and the incident, support and advice received, experience of criminal justice system organisationsfull sample module: community sentencing, criminal justice systemquarter-sample modules (addresses are randomly allocated to one of four modules at the sampling stage), covering fear of crime, workplace violence, criminal justice system organisations, experience of being insulted/pestered/intimidated, fraud (card and identity), civil justice, road safety camerasself-completion questionnaire, covering illicit drug use, stalking and harassment, partner abuse, and sexual victimisation.

Scotland. The survey is an important resource for both the government and public of Scotland. Respondents are selected at random from the Postal Address File and participation in the survey is entirely voluntary. The main aims of the SCJS are to:provide reliable statistics on people's experience of crime in Scotland, including services provided to victims of crimeassess the varying risk of crime for different groups of people in the populationexamine trends in the level and nature of crime in Scotland over timecollect information about people's experiences of, and attitudes on a range of crime and justice related issuesAn important role of the SCJS is to provide an alternative and complementary measure of crime to police recorded crime statistics. For further details of the scope and methodology of the SCJS, please see documentation. Information about the survey and links to publications may be found on the Scottish Government's Scottish Crime and Justice Survey webpages.\\n\\nBackground and history of the SCJSPrevious surveys of victimisation in Scotland began with the Scottish components of the 1982 and 1988 sweeps of the British Crime Survey (BCS) (held at the Archive under SNs 4368 and 4599) The Scottish element of the 1988 BCS was also known as the Scottish Areas Crime Survey and coverage was limited in those early surveys to the areas south of the Caledonian Canal. From 2012, the BCS has been renamed the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) (held under GN 33174). \\nThe first independent Scotland-only crime survey was commissioned by the Scottish Office in 1993 under the title of the Scottish Crime Survey (SCS) and was followed by repeated sweeps in 1996 (both years held together under SN 3813), and again in 2000 (SN 4542) and 2003 (SN 5756). In 2004 the survey underwent both a name change, to the Scottish Crime and Victimisation Survey (SCVS) (SN 5757), and a major methodological change, with a move away from in-home face-to-face interviewing to telephone interviewing. However, the 2006 SCVS (SN 5784) returned to face-to-face interviewing after it was shown that the robustness of the data produced by the 2004 telephone survey could not be substantiated. From 2008-2009, the series name was changed to the present title, the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey, and it moved to a repeated annual cross-sectional schedule based on financial year. From 2012-13 the SCJS moved from annual to biennial survey covering the financial year however, the 2014-15 survey was the last biennial survey and currently the SCJS is conducted on an annual basis. See the documentation for further details.\\n\\nSpecial Licence dataFrom 2012-13 only the Main Questionnaire data are available under standard End User Licence (EUL) agreement. The Victim Form and Self-Completion data are available under Special Licence (SL). The SL data have more restrictive access conditions than those made available under the standard EUL. Prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version.\\n\\nSCJS 2008-2009:\\nThe sample design for the SCJS 2008-2009 differed from those of the preceding SCVS and SCS surveys in a number of important respects. Firstly, its planned annual sample size of 16,000 interviews was considerably larger than before (for example the 2006 SCVS had a sample size of 5,000). Secondly, the required design had to obtain the equivalent of at least 1,000 simple random sample interviews in each Police Force Area (PFA). Lastly, whereas the previous surveys had completely clustered designs, the majority of the SCJS sample was un-clustered; clustering only occurred in the more sparsely populated 'rural' areas of Scotland. Fieldwork for the 2008-2009 SCJS began in April 2008 and finished in March 2009, with a target of 1,333 interviews being conducted each calendar month. For further details, see documentation.\\n\\n The 2008-2009 SCJS questionnaire consisted of the following modules:Main questionnaire: demographic details, general views on crime and social issues, victim form screener victim form (repeated up to five times, based on information from the screeners section): incident details, perception of the offender and the incident, support and advice received, experience of criminal justice system organisationsfull sample module: community sentencing, criminal justice systemquarter-sample modules (addresses are randomly allocated to one of four modules at the sampling stage), covering fear of crime, workplace violence, criminal justice system organisations, experience of being insulted/pestered/intimidated, fraud (card and identity), civil justice, road safety camerasself-completion questionnaire, covering illicit drug use, stalking and harassment, partner abuse, and sexual victimisation.\\nFor further details of coverage, see documentation.\",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/scottish-crime-and-justice-survey-2008-2009-scjs\",\"identifier\":[\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-6362-1\"],\"keywords\":[],\"creator\":[{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"Scottish Government\"},{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"TNS-BMRB Scotland\"}]}"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"c:[\"$\",\"$5\",null,{\"fallback\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":\"Loading...\"}],\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$L16\",null,{\"strategy\":\"beforeInteractive\",\"id\":\"structured-data\",\"type\":\"application/ld+json\",\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"$17\"}}],\"$L18\"]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"19:I[78977,[\"9692\",\"static/js/9692.83f9877c.js\",\"1828\",\"static/js/1828.31087444.js\",\"690\",\"static/js/690.e023e61b.js\",\"7133\",\"static/js/7133.521b2ecd.js\",\"9829\",\"static/js/9829.124a89b0.js\",\"867\",\"static/js/867.7f6bef5e.js\",\"2939\",\"static/js/2939.aa50df5c.js\",\"5183\",\"static/js/5183.9f1a7545.js\",\"5738\",\"static/js/5738.d28a9943.js\",\"3055\",\"static/js/3055.87b66c06.js\",\"8977\",\"static/js/8977.89625695.js\",\"6387\",\"static/js/app/items/%5Bslug%5D/page.cedc9485.js\"],\"default\"]\n1a:T13e6,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"The Scottish Crime and Justice Survey (SCJS) is a social survey which asks people about their experiences and perceptions of crime in Scotland.

For further details of the scope and methodology of the SCJS, please see documentation. Information about the survey and links to publications may be found on the Scottish Government's Scottish Crime and Justice Survey webpages.\n\nBackground and history of the SCJSPrevious surveys of victimisation in Scotland began with the Scottish components of the 1982 and 1988 sweeps of the British Crime Survey (BCS) (held at the Archive under SNs 4368 and 4599) The Scottish element of the 1988 BCS was also known as the Scottish Areas Crime Survey and coverage was limited in those early surveys to the areas south of the Caledonian Canal. From 2012, the BCS has been renamed the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) (held under GN 33174). \nThe first independent Scotland-only crime survey was commissioned by the Scottish Office in 1993 under the title of the Scottish Crime Survey (SCS) and was followed by repeated sweeps in 1996 (both years held together under SN 3813), and again in 2000 (SN 4542) and 2003 (SN 5756). In 2004 the survey underwent both a name change, to the Scottish Crime and Victimisation Survey (SCVS) (SN 5757), and a major methodological change, with a move away from in-home face-to-face interviewing to telephone interviewing. However, the 2006 SCVS (SN 5784) returned to face-to-face interviewing after it was shown that the robustness of the data produced by the 2004 telephone survey could not be substantiated. From 2008-2009, the series name was changed to the present title, the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey, and it moved to a repeated annual cross-sectional schedule based on financial year. From 2012-13 the SCJS moved from annual to biennial survey covering the financial year however, the 2014-15 survey was the last biennial survey and currently the SCJS is conducted on an annual basis. See the documentation for further details.\n\nSpecial Licence dataFrom 2012-13 only the Main Questionnaire data are available under standard End User Licence (EUL) agreement. The Victim Form and Self-Completion data are available under Special Licence (SL). The SL data have more restrictive access conditions than those made available under the standard EUL. Prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version.\n\nSCJS 2008-2009:\nThe sample design for the SCJS 2008-2009 differed from those of the preceding SCVS and SCS surveys in a number of important respects. Firstly, its planned annual sample size of 16,000 interviews was considerably larger than before (for example the 2006 SCVS had a sample size of 5,000). Secondly, the required design had to obtain the equivalent of at least 1,000 simple random sample interviews in each Police Force Area (PFA). Lastly, whereas the previous surveys had completely clustered designs, the majority of the SCJS sample was un-clustered; clustering only occurred in the more sparsely populated 'rural' areas of Scotland.
