 The database in this study seeks to identify patterns of movement from Scottish ports for the first months for 1923 using information transferred digitally from the passenger manifests of the Board of Trade’s Statistical Department (BT27) held at The National Archives in Kew, London. It contains the records of 19,113 passengers and adds a unique quantitative dimension to the scholarship of the Research Institute of Irish and Scottish Studies. Tables in this database contain information about the period covered by the records, details of passengers, their port of destination and origin, as well as information on the different vessels or ships used.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Scottish Emigration Database, 1923"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Scottish Emigration Database, 1923"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/scottish-emigration-database-1923"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Scottish Emigration Database, 1923"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Scottish Emigration Database, 1923"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
