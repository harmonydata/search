A stratified sample of 80 survey respondents were then interviewed, divided into four groups determined by whether or not they were domiciled in Scotland prior to attending university, and whether or not they were currently domiciled in Scotland. These interviews aimed to give a more detailed understanding of the relative influence of, and interaction between, economic and non-economic factors as reasons behind graduate migration decisions. Overall, the research aimed to identify the kind of graduates who choose to stay in or leave Scotland, and the reasons which underlie these decisions.

This dataset includes the quantitative survey data only; the qualitative interview data have not been deposited.

 Topics covered include respondents' migration history (primary place of residence during the three years before commencement of their undergraduate degree); their location at the time of the survey (summer 2005); their location approximately six months after graduation, in January 2001; any additional locations of residence (exceeding three months) between 2001 and 2005. Information concerning respondents' current employment status, and their status in 2001 was also collected, and on primary motivations for migration at the time of graduation, and the factors deemed important when making decisions about where to live and work at the time of the survey. For those not living in Scotland at the time of the survey, perspectives on possible future return migration to Scotland were recorded. In addition, demographic data (gender, age, marital status, dependent children, social class background, ethnicity) and educational data (type of school attended, subject area and class of degree, postgraduate qualifications obtained or being pursued) were also collected.28:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2d"}]
