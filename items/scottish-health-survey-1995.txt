Data for the main risk factors - obesity, smoking, drinking, raised cholesterol, high blood pressure and lack of physical activity are also present.General health, use of health services, prescibed medicines and dental health: self-reported general health, longstanding illness or disability, and acute sickness in addition to the prevalence of gastroenteritis within the population was measured. Use of a number of health services - GP consultations, inpatient stays and outpatient visits, blood pressure and cholesterol monitoring are also present as are informants' reports of the prescribed medicines they take. Dental health data includes prevalence of false teeth, and dental practices.Psychosocial well-being: emotional well-being using GHQ12 was measured.Accidents: the number and causes of accidents along with their location and the types of injuries incurred are present in the dataset.Standard measures: Edinburgh Claudication questionnaire; Rose Angina questionnaire; blood pressure; body mass index; waist-hip ratio; GHQ12; MRC Respiratory questionnaire (breathlessness, phlegm and wheezing); social class based on Registrar General's Standard Occupational Classification; CAGE questionnaire for problem drinking (16-17 year olds only).18:T1290,The Scottish Health Survey (SHeS) series was established in 1995. Commissioned by the Scottish Government Health Directorates, the series provides regular information on aspects of the public's health and factors related to health which cannot be obtained from other sources. The SHeS series was designed to:estimate the prevalence of particular health conditions in Scotland;estimate the prevalence of certain risk factors associated with these health conditions and to document the pattern of related health behaviours;look at differences between regions and between subgroups of the population in the extent of their having these particular health conditions or risk factors, and to make comparisons with other national statistics for Scotland and England;monitor trends in the population's health over time;make a major contribution to monitoring progress towards health targets.Each survey in the series includes a set of core questions and measurements (height and weight and, if applicable, blood pressure, waist circumference, urine and saliva samples), plus modules of questions on specific health conditions that vary from year to year. Each year the core sample has also been augmented by an additional boosted sample for children. Since 2008 NHS Health Boards have also had the opportunity to boost the number of adult interviews carried out in their area.

The 1995 Scottish Health Survey is the first in the series.
The survey consisted of a number of core questions and measurements (such as height and weight), plus modules of questions on selected subjects. The specific topic included in the 1995 survey was cardiovascular disease and its associated risk factors.For the fourth edition (October 2018),  the variables PSU and Strata were added to the individual file. Physical activity: the questionnaire covers three types of physical activity: occupation, home, and sports and exercise. Two measures of physical activity were used: a frequency-intensity activity level and a maximum intensity level. Attitudes towards taking more exercise are also covered.Eating habits: information on self-reported eating habits was collected for a wide range of food types.Smoking: data on self-reported current and past smoking behaviour, attitudes to stopping smoking, and exposure to other people's tobacco smoke were collected. Levels of the blood analyte serum cotinine are used to validate self-reports of smoking behaviour.Drinking: self-reported levels of weekly alcohol consumption, attitudes to cutting down drinking, problem drinking among 16-17 year olds, and the relationship between the blood analyte gamma gt and reported alcohol consumption are covered.Blood pressure: blood pressure levels for the survey population were measured.Obesity: height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist-hip ratio were measured.Respiratory symptoms and lung function tests: data for three common respiratory symptoms - phlegm production, breathlessness and wheezing - were collected. Lung function test results for FEV1, FVC and PEF are contained in the dataset.Blood analytes: total and HDL-cholesterol, fibrinogen, haemoglobin and serum ferritin were analysed as well as vitamins A, C and E, and carotenoids.Cardiovascular disease and its risk factors: the survey contains questions on self-reported cardiovascular disease and related conditions.
