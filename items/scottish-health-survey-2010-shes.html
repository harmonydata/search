Commissioned by the Scottish Government Health Directorates, the series provides regular information on aspects of the public&#x27;s health and factors related to health which cannot be obtained from other sources. The SHeS series was designed to:estimate the prevalence of particular health conditions in Scotland;estimate the prevalence of certain risk factors associated with these health conditions and to document the pattern of related health behaviours;look at differences between regions and between subgroups of the population in the extent of their having these particular health conditions or risk factors, and to make comparisons with other national statistics for Scotland and England;monitor trends in the population&#x27;s health over time;make a major contribution to monitoring progress towards health targets.Each survey in the series includes a set of core questions and measurements (height and weight and, if applicable, blood pressure, waist circumference, urine and saliva samples), plus modules of questions on specific health conditions that vary from year to year. Each year the core sample has also been augmented by an additional boosted sample for children. Since 2008 NHS Health Boards have also had the opportunity to boost the number of adult interviews carried out in their area.  

The Scottish Government Scottish Health Survey webpages contain further information about the series, including latest news and publications. 

The Scottish Health Survey, 2010 was designed to provide data at a national level about the population living in private households in Scotland. The sample for the 2010 survey, as in previous years, was drawn from the Postcode Address File (PAF). An initial sample of 10,180 addresses was selected and grouped into 439 interviewer batches, with around 37 batches covered each month between January and December 2010. The addresses comprised three sample types:
7,866 formed the main sample, at which adults and children were eligible to be selected for interview
1,798 addresses formed an additional child boost sample at which only households containing children aged 0-15 were eligible to participate
516 addresses (in Grampian, Fife and Borders) formed the Health Board boost sample, at which only adults were eligible for interview.
Latest edition information
For the fourth edition (July 2021) OECD equivalised income derived variables were added to the individual file. The new variables are: OECD (OECD household score for equivalised income); eqvinc_15 (Equivalised income - OECD score); eqv5_15 (Equivalised Income Quintiles); and eqv10_15 (Equivalised Income Deciles).
Questionnaires
The individual questionnaire covered: general health and wellbeing; cardiovascular disease and use of services; asthma; eating habits; adult (16 years and over) and child (2-15 years) physical activity; fruit and vegetable consumption; smoking and alcohol consumption (16 years and over); dental health (16 years and over); economic activity; education; parental history; measurements and standard classification questions. Some participants also answered questions about their knowledge of health messages, attitudes to health and motivations to make lifestyle changes for health purposes. The Version A module of the 2010 questionnaire covering respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms, asthma, eating habits and physical activity at work, was also fielded in 2008 (see information on combined data file below), and many will be asked again in 2012 (though some questions will be dropped as a result of the questionnaire consultation that took place in 2011).

The adult self-completion questionnaire covered drinking experiences, recent general health, and contraception. The Young Adults self-completion questionnaire covered smoking, drinking and contraception. The self-completion questionnaire for child respondents aged 13-15 years covered recent general health, and the self-completion booklet for the parents of 4-12 year olds comprised the standard Strengths and Difficulties (SDQ) questionnaire.

The nurse visit covered: prescribed medicines, vitamin supplements, nicotine replacement therapy, blood pressure, anxiety, self-harm, food poisoning, waist and hip circumference, demi-span (respondents aged 65 years and over), lung function, blood sample, saliva sample and urine sample.
