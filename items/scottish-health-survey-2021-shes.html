Latest edition informationFor the second edition (April 2023), three &#x27;Intake24&#x27; data files have been added to the study, covering foods, nutrients and additional variables. The documentation has been updated and augmented accordingly.
The Scottish Health Survey 2021 (SHeS21) is the seventeenth survey in the series. Data collection involved a main computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI), and an online or paper self-completion questionnaire. As interviews were conducted by telephone, no height and weight measurements or biological measures could be taken. Topics covered included household composition, demographics (including ethnicity, religion, educational background and economic activity), general health including caring, mental health and wellbeing, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and asthma, physical activity, eating habits, fruit and veg consumption, smoking and drinking, gambling, dental health, discrimination and harassment, social capital and self-reported height and weight measurements. Adults aged 16 and over were also invited to complete an online recall using Intake24.The study also includes combined datasets covering 2017/2018/2019/2021 and 2019/2021. They contain information from the household questionnaires, main individual schedules and self-completions. The combined datasets have been provided to give a larger base for the analysis of variables.

The SHeS series was designed to:estimate the prevalence of particular health conditions in Scotland;estimate the prevalence of certain risk factors associated with these health conditions and to document the pattern of related health behaviours;look at differences between regions and between subgroups of the population in the extent of their having these particular health conditions or risk factors, and to make comparisons with other national statistics for Scotland and England;monitor trends in the population's health over time;make a major contribution to monitoring progress towards health targets.Each survey in the series includes a set of core questions and measurements (height and weight and, if applicable, blood pressure, waist circumference, urine and saliva samples), plus modules of questions on specific health conditions that vary from year to year. Each year the core sample has also been augmented by an additional boosted sample for children. Since 2008 NHS Health Boards have also had the opportunity to boost the number of adult interviews carried out in their area.  \\n\\nThe Scottish Government Scottish Health Survey webpages contain further information about the series, including latest news and publications. \\n\\nLatest edition informationFor the second edition (April 2023), three 'Intake24' data files have been added to the study, covering foods, nutrients and additional variables.

Data collection involved a main computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI), and an online or paper self-completion questionnaire. As interviews were conducted by telephone, no height and weight measurements or biological measures could be taken. Topics covered included household composition, demographics (including ethnicity, religion, educational background and economic activity), general health including caring, mental health and wellbeing, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and asthma, physical activity, eating habits, fruit and veg consumption, smoking and drinking, gambling, dental health, discrimination and harassment, social capital and self-reported height and weight measurements. Adults aged 16 and over were also invited to complete an online recall using Intake24.The study also includes combined datasets covering 2017/2018/2019/2021 and 2019/2021. They contain information from the household questionnaires, main individual schedules and self-completions. The combined datasets have been provided to give a larger base for the analysis of variables.
