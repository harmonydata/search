For the second edition (June 2010), data and documentation from the main survey and the culture and sport module have been added to the dataset, which previously contained only the travel diary data and documentation.
Culture and sport module:
The culture and sport module starts with a household module which is similar to the main questionnaire but is substantially shorter, collecting only core demographic data about the household from the household respondent. The module itself is directed to a random adult in the household and covers the following topics: culture and sport when growing up, participation in creative and cultural activities, archive centres and records office, libraries, historical sites, museums and galleries, sport and physical recreation, local sports facilities, attendance at live sports, internet use and volunteering.

Main survey:
The main survey questionnaire is in two parts. Householders or their spouses/partners complete Part 1 of the interview. Once the composition of the household has been established, one of the adults in the household is randomly selected to complete Part 2. In all households with a single adult the same person completes both parts, but as the number of adults in the household increases, the probability of the random adult being the same as the household respondent declines. The household section of the interview deals with topics such as household composition, housing and tenure, health, the vehicles available to the household, the occupation and industry of the highest income householder, household income and housing costs. The 'random adult' section deals with individuals' housing change, tenure change, neighbourhood problems, transport and use of public transport, public services, income and employment.

Travel diary:
In addition to the main questionnaire, the travel diary collects information about personal travel on the day prior to the interview. One randomly chosen adult per household in the sample is selected to complete the travel diary. The 'journey' and 'stage' files compiled from the travel diary provide information on the means of transport used, purposes for which people travel, distances that they cover, start and end times of trips, duration of journeys, car occupancy, council area of the journey start and destination locations, and days of the week that adults travel. The 'home to work' and 'home to school' files provide information on the estimated straight line distance ('as the crow flies') in kilometres from home to work or home to school. For further information, see documentation.

Standard measures:
The survey uses many of the harmonised questions for government social surveys.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Scottish Household Survey, 2007-2008 / SHS","description":"$15","url":["https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=6361"],"keywords":[],"identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-6361-1"],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UK Data Service","url":"https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=6361"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Scottish Centre for Social Research"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Ipsos MORI"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Scottish Government"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"TNS-BMRB Scotland"}]},"extra_data":{"study_design":["survey"],"name":"Scottish Household Survey, 2007-2008 / SHS","source":["ukds"],"duration_years":null,"language_codes":["en"],"instruments":[],"geographic_coverage":"","num_variables":null,"slug":"scottish-household-survey-2007-2008-shs","country_codes":["GB"],"data_access":"<a href=\"https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/crown-copyright/\" target=\"_blank\">© Crown copyright</a>.

In addition to the main questionnaire, the travel diary collects information about personal travel on the day prior to the interview. One randomly chosen adult per household in the sample is selected to complete the travel diary. The 'journey' and 'stage' files compiled from the travel diary provide information on the means of transport used, purposes for which people travel, distances that they cover, start and end times of trips, duration of journeys, car occupancy, council area of the journey start and destination locations, and days of the week that adults travel. The 'home to work' and 'home to school' files provide information on the estimated straight line distance ('as the crow flies') in kilometres from home to work or home to school. For further information, see documentation.

Standard measures:
The survey uses many of the harmonised questions for government social surveys.18:T10e8,The Scottish Household Survey (SHS) is a continuous survey based on a sample of the general population in private residences in Scotland. It is financed by the Scottish Government (previously the Scottish Executive). The survey started in 1999 and up to 2011 followed a fairly consistent survey design. From 2012 onwards, the survey was substantially redesigned to include elements of the Scottish House Condition Survey (SHCS) (also available from the UK Data Service), including the physical survey. The SHS is run through a consortium led by Ipsos MORI. The survey is designed to provide reliable and up-to-date information on the composition, characteristics, attitudes and behaviour of private households and individuals, both nationally and at a sub-national level and to examine the physical condition of Scotland's homes. It covers a wide range of topics to allow links to be made between different policy areas.Further information about the survey series, and links to publications, can be found on the Scottish Government's Scottish Household Survey webpages.COVID-19 restrictionsDue to COVID-19 restrictions, the SHS was conducted by telephone or via MS Teams in 2020 and 2021 (SNs 9186 and 9187). Face-to-face interviewing resumed for SHS 2022 (SN 9294) when restrictions had been lifted. The Scottish Household Survey, 2007-2008 was extended to include a boost module designed to collect policy relevant information on culture and sport. The sampling strategy has also been revised to achieve a higher proportion of interviews from the unclustered sample. Further information can be found in the documentation.

For the second edition (June 2010), data and documentation from the main survey and the culture and sport module have been added to the dataset, which previously contained only the travel diary data and documentation.
Culture and sport module:
The culture and sport module starts with a household module which is similar to the main questionnaire but is substantially shorter, collecting only core demographic data about the household from the household respondent. The module itself is directed to a random adult in the household and covers the following topics: culture and sport when growing up, participation in creative and cultural activities, archive centres and records office, libraries, historical sites, museums and galleries, sport and physical recreation, local sports facilities, attendance at live sports, internet use and volunteering.

Main survey:
The main survey questionnaire is in two parts. Householders or their spouses/partners complete Part 1 of the interview. Once the composition of the household has been established, one of the adults in the household is randomly selected to complete Part 2. In all households with a single adult the same person completes both parts, but as the number of adults in the household increases, the probability of the random adult being the same as the household respondent declines. The household section of the interview deals with topics such as household composition, housing and tenure, health, the vehicles available to the household, the occupation and industry of the highest income householder, household income and housing costs. The 'random adult' section deals with individuals' housing change, tenure change, neighbourhood problems, transport and use of public transport, public services, income and employment.

Travel diary:
In addition to the main questionnaire, the travel diary collects information about personal travel on the day prior to the interview. One randomly chosen adult per household in the sample is selected to complete the travel diary. The 'journey' and 'stage' files compiled from the travel diary provide information on the means of transport used, purposes for which people travel, distances that they cover, start and end times of trips, duration of journeys, car occupancy, council area of the journey start and destination locations, and days of the week that adults travel. The 'home to work' and 'home to school' files provide information on the estimated straight line distance ('as the crow flies') in kilometres from home to work or home to school.
