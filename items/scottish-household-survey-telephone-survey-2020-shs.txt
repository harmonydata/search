However, 2020 data were collected in October 2020 and January-March of 2021, while the 2021 data were collected over the course of a whole year, between April 2021 and March 2022. So, users should consider potential seasonal effects when making comparisons between the two survey years.

2a:Ta14,The Scottish Household Survey (SHS) is a continuous survey based on a sample of the general population in private residences in Scotland. It is financed by the Scottish Government (previously the Scottish Executive). The survey started in 1999 and up to 2011 followed a fairly consistent survey design. From 2012 onwards, the survey was substantially redesigned to include elements of the Scottish House Condition Survey (SHCS) (also available from the UK Data Service), including the physical survey. The SHS is run through a consortium led by Ipsos MORI. The survey is designed to provide reliable and up-to-date information on the composition, characteristics, attitudes and behaviour of private households and individuals, both nationally and at a sub-national level and to examine the physical condition of Scotland's homes. It covers a wide range of topics to allow links to be made between different policy areas.Further information about the survey series, and links to publications, can be found on the Scottish Government's Scottish Household Survey webpages.COVID-19 restrictionsDue to COVID-19 restrictions, the SHS was conducted by telephone or via MS Teams in 2020 and 2021 (SNs 9186 and 9187). Face-to-face interviewing resumed for SHS 2022 (SN 9294) when restrictions had been lifted.
SHS 2020 and 2021Typically, SHS respondents have been interviewed face-to-face in their homes. However, in March 2020, the fieldwork approach was altered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Only a small proportion of the 2020 survey had been completed. The approach was adapted, and the remainder of the 2020 survey fieldwork was carried out using telephone interviewing. Around 3,000 households were interviewed for the SHS 2020 telephone survey, compared to around 10,500 for the SHS 2019. The results of the SHS 2020 telephone survey are not directly comparable to SHS results for previous years. The results from the 2020 and 2021 Telephone Surveys are broadly comparable. However, 2020 data were collected in October 2020 and January-March of 2021, while the 2021 data were collected over the course of a whole year, between April 2021 and March 2022. So, users should consider potential seasonal effects when making comparisons between the two survey years.
