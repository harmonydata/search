Experience of crime victimisation, perceptions of crime, feelings of safety, worry about crime, security consciousness, perceptions of the police and demographics (including, work, health and key-worker status).The questionnaire for the SVTS was shorter than the SCJS, and whilst the great majority of those questions which collect information to allow the accurate measurement of adults' experience of crime were retained, there are otherwise few questions which are the same on the SCJS and the SVTS.
