2d:Tc89,The Scottish Young People Survey (SYPS), a cohort series, began in  1984, subsuming the Scottish Qualified School Leavers Surveys, (GN 33237).  It is a postal survey in which questionnaires are initially sent to young people approximately nine months after they have left school or have completed their 4th year in secondary school.
Each survey cycle comprises two studies; a longitudinal survey of a school-year-group cohort and a cross-sectional survey of school leavers.  The sample and design of the two studies overlap.
The Cohort constituent of each cycle, chosen every two years, takes in a sample of students in their 4th year at school who then receive questionnaires the following Spring as part of the Spring Survey.  Each cohort is then surveyed after an interval of two years six months. 
The School Leavers constituent of each cycle is a cross-sectional survey of school leavers.  It takes place in the Spring at two-yearly intervals, and has been conducted since 1977 in its present form, though a study of qualified school leavers started back in 1962 (see GN: 33237).
The 1983/84 Cohort began in 1985.  The two study groups were:          
- a school-year group of people who were in their last compulsory year (4th year) in Session 1983-84                                    
- a school-leaver group of people who left from any school year (3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th) in Session 1983-84  
People who left school from 4th year in 1983-84 were represented in both samples.
A second sweep of the school-year group cohort was carried out in 1986.
The 1985/86 Cohort began in 1987.  The two study groups were:
- a school-year group of people who were in their last compulsory year (4th year) in Session 1985-86
- a school-leaver group of people who left from any school year (3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th) in Session 1985-6
People who left school from 4th year in 1985-86 were represented in both samples.
A second sweep of the school-year group cohort was carried out in Autumn 1989
The 1987/88 Cohort began in 1989.  The two study groups were:
- a school-year-group of people  who were in their last compulsory year (4th year) in Session 1987-88
- a school-leaver group of people who left from any school year (3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th) in Session 1987-88
People who left school from 4th year in 1987-88 were represented in both samples.
A second sweep of the school-year group cohort was carried out in 1991.
The 1989/90 cohort began in 1991.   The two study groups were:    
- a school-year group of people who were in their last compulsory year (4th year) in Session 1989-90
