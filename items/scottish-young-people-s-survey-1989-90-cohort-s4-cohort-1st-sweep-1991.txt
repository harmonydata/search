Standard Measures
Standard Occupational Classification (vol. 3)17:Tc7c,The Scottish Young People Survey (SYPS), a cohort series, began in  1984, subsuming the Scottish Qualified School Leavers Surveys, (GN 33237).  It is a postal survey in which questionnaires are initially sent to young people approximately nine months after they have left school or have completed their 4th year in secondary school.
Each survey cycle comprises two studies; a longitudinal survey of a school-year-group cohort and a cross-sectional survey of school leavers.  The sample and design of the two studies overlap.
The Cohort constituent of each cycle, chosen every two years, takes in a sample of students in their 4th year at school who then receive questionnaires the following Spring as part of the Spring Survey.  Each cohort is then surveyed after an interval of two years six months. 
The School Leavers constituent of each cycle is a cross-sectional survey of school leavers.  It takes place in the Spring at two-yearly intervals, and has been conducted since 1977 in its present form, though a study of qualified school leavers started back in 1962 (see GN: 33237).
The 1983/84 Cohort began in 1985.  The two study groups were:
