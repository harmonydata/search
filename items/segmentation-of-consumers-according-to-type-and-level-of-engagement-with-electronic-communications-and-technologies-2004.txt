Around 40,000 electors in Great Britain were thereby allocated to one of 23 distinct clusters in the data. The classification system was built using a series of publicly-available data items known about virtually all British electors. These have been combined in such a way as to optimise discrimination across a series of 80 different measures of consumer behaviour sources, taken from a lifestyle questionnaire database. Thus, the classification was compiled using results of some 80 response codes on over 500,000 lifestyle questionnaires collected over the three years prior to the project. \n\nThe classification system is in the form of a look-up table relating the cluster codes to a set of values on two multivariate classification systems, one at the person level (Pixel), the other operating at the postcode level (Mosaic). The information used to compile the classification included: length of residence and household composition obtained from the electoral registers of Great Britain local authorities; estimates of age based partly on attributes from said electoral registers; textual parsing of information from the Post Office Postal Address File (PAF); and names and addresses of company directors supplied by Companies House and from a number of shareholder registers.
