The information used to compile the classification included: length of residence and household composition obtained from the electoral registers of Great Britain local authorities; estimates of age based partly on attributes from said electoral registers; textual parsing of information from the Post Office Postal Address File (PAF); and names and addresses of company directors supplied by Companies House and from a number of shareholder registers.
