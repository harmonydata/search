Therefore, the objective of this data set was to (i) develops a model that enables a description of the servitization processes, (ii) the principal stages of organisational change, and (iii) the forces impacting these processes.  It is based on a series of 14 case studies of the process of servitization over time in multinational manufacturers. Evidence and analysis from these cases are used to establish that manufacturers undergo four stages of organisational maturity (Exploration, Engagement, Expansion and Exploitation), through which an organisation progresses according to the pressures of five principal forces (customer pull, technology push, value network positioning, organisational readiness, and organisational commitment). This progression can be characterised as a business growth model with multiple crises or tipping points. This contributes to our understanding of the process of servitization and proposes a model which can be used to explain progression. It also forms the basis to better prepare manufacturers as to what to expect as they embark on a servitization journey.Manufacturing organisations in developed western economies are increasingly shifting from traditional product-based offerings towards service-oriented business models. Firms such as Rolls Royce, GE, Xerox and Siemens are remaining competitive by creating additional value to their customers through the services they provide, and taking a share of this value. Over the years, providing services embedded within products' offerings has gradually become a fundamental business constituent for manufacturing organisations.\nUnderstanding the organisational transformation required to operate in this way has been an enduring challenge to both researchers and practitioners, and only a few notable contributions address the topic. Some prominent scholars have set out the benefits of, and barriers to, undertaking the transformation , while others describe the state of being a 'servitized' manufacturer and the impact this delivers, but few really deal holistically with the dynamics of the process of transformation itself, or distinguish what is particular about servitization over general organisational change.
