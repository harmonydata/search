LSOA/Data Zone modelling data. The SIPHER Synthetic Population is a digital twin of the adult population aged 16 years and older in Great Britain. It reflects more than 50 million synthetic individuals - all of which are represented through 'real' individuals covered in the Understanding Society survey. The dataset is a large-scale, two-variable file including the variables 'pidp' and 'synthetic_zone'. The dataset shared is intended for linkage with Understanding Society survey data files such as 'k_indresp' and “k_hhresp” using the survey’s person identifier variable ('pidp'). Please see the respective User Guide provided for this dataset for further information on linkages and intended applications.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"SIPHER Synthetic Population for Individuals in Great Britain, 2019-2021"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"SIPHER Synthetic Population for Individuals in Great Britain, 2019-2021"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/sipher-synthetic-population-for-individuals-in-great-britain-2019-2021"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"SIPHER Synthetic Population for Individuals in Great Britain, 2019-2021"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"SIPHER Synthetic Population for Individuals in Great Britain, 2019-2021"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
