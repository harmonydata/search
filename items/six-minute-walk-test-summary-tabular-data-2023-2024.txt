From these, the drop in SpO2 can be calculated and was compared between two different 6MWTs - one where the patient was asked to walk as far as possible (a maximal 6MWT; M-6MWT) or at their normal walking pace (N-6MWT). The dataset presented provides all raw and calculated data from these two tests for each participant, scored by two independent assessors (as there is some subjectivity in determining these parameters).

The purpose of the project was to assess if the standard M-6MWT (as recommended by international guidelines) differed from asking patients to walk at their normal walking pace. Because a M-6MWT may not reflect normal daily living, this test may lead to an inaccurate assessment of their requirement for ambulatory oxygen. It may also not accurately measure the normal changes in oxygen saturation (or desaturation) that occurs in these patients during their normal daily activities (such as walking to the shops, walking up the stairs, gardening).

We hypothesise that performing a N-6MWT will provide a more accurate assessment of a patients' oxygen requirement, primarily from their oxygen desaturation during the test.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Six-minute Walk Test Summary Tabular Data, 2023-2024"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Six-minute Walk Test Summary Tabular Data, 2023-2024"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/six-minute-walk-test-summary-tabular-data-2023-2024"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Six-minute Walk Test Summary Tabular Data, 2023-2024"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Six-minute Walk Test Summary Tabular Data, 2023-2024"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
