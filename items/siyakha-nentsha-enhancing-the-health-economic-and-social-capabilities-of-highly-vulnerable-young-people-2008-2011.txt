The skills are geared to help offer protective strategies against HIV and mechanisms for coping with and mitigating the impacts of AIDS, with the long-term goal of building economic, social and health assets.

The study has three intervention arms: control, partial intervention and full intervention. These arms were randomised at the classroom level for 10th and 11th graders in Round 1 in seven secondary schools. One school that received a delayed intervention served as the control sample. The two versions of the intervention differ in that the full version includes HIV/AIDS education, social capital building, and financial capabilities, whereas the partial version omits the financial capabilities component. The study began in January 2008 and lasted for 36 months, with measures on individual students at baseline and post-intervention. The number of individuals who were part of at least Round 1 or Round 2 is 1,307. Individuals can be uniquely identified with the variables qnum (round 1) and IDNUM (round 2).
