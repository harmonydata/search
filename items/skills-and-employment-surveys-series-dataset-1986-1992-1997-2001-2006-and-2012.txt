For each survey, weights are computed to take into account the differential probabilities of sample selection, the over-sampling of certain areas and some small response rate variations between groups (defined by sex, age and occupation). All surveys cover Great Britain except the Skills Survey, 2006 which covers the United Kingdom.  

The six surveys are all available separately from the UK Data Archive:Social Change and Economic Life Initiative Surveys, 1986-1987 (SN 2798)Employment in Britain, 1992 (SN 5368)Skills Survey, 1997 (SN 3993)Skills Survey, 2001 (SN 4972)Skills Survey, 2006 (SN 6004)Skills and Employment Survey, 2012 (SN 7466)A Special Licence access version of this study including finer detailed geographical variables may become available from the UK Data Archive in the future.

For the second edition (May 2014) an updated version of the data file and the accompanying Technical Briefing document. The depositor has provided the following advice: "Users are altered to errors recently detected in the 4-digit coding of SOC (both 2000 and 2010 versions). This has resulted in further changes to the coding of SOC2000 at 3, 2 and 1-digits as well as amendments to the weighting variables which are partly based on SOC (weightall and weight0612)." The Skills and Employment Survey 2012 dataset, held under SN 7466, has also been updated accordingly.

The surveys aim to investigate the employed workforce in Great Britain. Although they were not originally planned as part of a series and had different funding sources and objectives, continuity in questionnaire design has meant the surveys now provide a unique, national representative picture of change in British workplaces as reported by individual job holders. This allows analysts to examine how various aspects of job quality and skill levels have changed over 30 years.The first surveys in the series were carried out in 1986 and 1992. These surveys also form part of this integrated data series, and are known as the Social Change and Economic Life Initiative (SCELI) and Employment in Britain (EIB) studies respectively.The 1997 survey was the first to collect primarily data on skills using the job requirements approach. This focused on collecting data on objective indicators of job skill as reported by respondents. The 2001 survey assessed how much had changed between the two surveys and a third survey in 2006 enhanced the time series data, while providing a resource for analysing skill and job requirements in the British economy at that time. The 2012 survey aimed to again add to the time series data and, coinciding as it did with a period of economic recession, to provide insight into whether workers in Britain felt under additional pressure/demand from employers as a result of redundancies and cut backs. In addition, a series dataset, covering 1986, 1992, 1997, 2001, 2006 and 2012 is also available . A follow-up to the 2012 survey was conducted in 2014, revisiting respondents who had agreed to be interviewed again. The 2017 survey was the seventh in the series, designed to examine to what extent pressures had continued as a result of austerity and economic uncertainties triggered, for example, by Brexit as well as examining additional issues such as productivity, fairness at work and the retirement intentions of older workers.Each survey comprises a large number of respondents: 4,047 in the 1986 survey; 3,855 in 1992; 2,467 in 1997; 4,470 in 2001; 7,787 in 2006; 3,200 in 2012; and 3,306 in 2017. The Skills and Employment Surveys Series Dataset, 1986, 1992, 1997, 2001, 2006 and 2012 combines data from all six surveys in the series, where common survey questions were asked. For each survey, weights are computed to take into account the differential probabilities of sample selection, the over-sampling of certain areas and some small response rate variations between groups (defined by sex, age and occupation). All surveys cover Great Britain except the Skills Survey, 2006 which covers the United Kingdom.
