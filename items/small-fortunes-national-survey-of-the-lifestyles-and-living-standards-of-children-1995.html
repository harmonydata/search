Taking the child as the unit of analysis, its main aims were :
to establish household expenditure on children and to investigate variation by income, age and gender of child and by family size and status;
to estimate certain of the indirect costs imposed by child rearing;
to determine the nature and extent of extra household support for children;
to specify and compare, the minimum direct costs of children according to budget standard, consensual, self-assessment and behavioural definitions;
to examine the nature and degree of poverty in childhood according to those definitions given above;
to investigate the &#x27;economics of parenting&#x27;: the extent to which children&#x27;s aspirations are met at the expense of the living standards of parents; parent/child interactions on finance; parents&#x27; economic aspirations for their children;
to explore childhood living standards from children&#x27;s own perspectives, investigating their experience of money and its management; knowledge and understanding of the family&#x27;s financial circumstances in the context of the immediate neighbourhood and wider society.
