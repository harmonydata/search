2c:T934,The Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use among Young People surveys began in 1982, under the name Smoking among Secondary Schoolchildren. The series initially aimed to provide national estimates of the proportion of secondary schoolchildren aged 11-15 who smoked, and to describe their smoking behaviour. Similar surveys were carried out every two years until 1998 to monitor trends in the prevalence of cigarette smoking. The survey then moved to an annual cycle, and questions on alcohol consumption and drug use were included. The name of the series changed to Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use among Young Teenagers to reflect this widened focus. In 2000, the series title changed, to Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use among Young People. NHS Digital (formerly the Information Centre for Health and Social Care) took over from the Department of Health as sponsors and publishers of the survey series from 2005. From 2014 onwards, the series changed to a biennial one, with no survey taking place in 2015, 2017 or 2019.In some years, the surveys have been carried out in Scotland and Wales as well as England, to provide separate national estimates for these countries. In 2002, following a review of Scotland's future information needs in relation to drug misuse among schoolchildren, a separate Scottish series, Scottish Schools Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance Use Survey (SALSUS) was established by the Scottish Executive. The 2003 survey  focused mainly on drug use, as set by the focus pattern of the survey series.

Topics covered include smoking and smoking behaviour, drinking and drinking behaviour, alcohol drunk in last week, drug use and drug use behaviour, attitudes to and awareness of drugs, availability of drugs and drug education. Classificatory, school and demographic information is also included in the data file. Some administrative variables have been removed in order to ensure respondent confidentiality is maintained (for example date of interview and day of date of birth).

Most schools also completed a policy questionnaire, which covered guidelines on adult (staff and visitors) smoking on school premises, disciplinary action for pupils found smoking, drinking or taking drugs on school premises, and policy for dealing with pupils not caught in the act of taking, but clearly under the influence of, drugs or alcohol at school.28:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2c"}]
