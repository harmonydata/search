In 2002, following a review of Scotland's future information needs in relation to drug misuse among schoolchildren, a separate Scottish series, Scottish Schools Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance Use Survey (SALSUS) was established by the Scottish Executive. As well as the core questions on smoking, drinking and drug use, the 2009 questionnaire collected more extensive information about drug use. This included:the circumstances of drug usepupils’ reactions to taking drugsreasons for refusing drugsdrug dependencethe attitudes of pupils and their families to drug usethe impact of school lessons and other sources of information about drugsMost schools also completed a policy questionnaire, which covered guidelines on adult (staff and visitors) smoking on school premises, disciplinary action for pupils found smoking, drinking or taking drugs on school premises, and policy for dealing with pupils not caught in the act of taking, but clearly under the influence of, drugs or alcohol at school.28:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2c"}]
