How can inequality measures inform our understanding of the distributions of social and environmental deprivation in rural England? 3. How do rural residents experience the kinds of inequality identified by the research, and what types of inequalities do they perceive as inequitable? 4. Are there identifiable areas of rural England where the potential for environmental and social inequity suggests a need for policy intervention?
Inequality in social, economic and environmental conditions has important implications for individuals or groups of people experiencing its negative effects, but also for society as a whole. In urban areas, poor environments are associated frequently with deprivation and social exclusion. Where the unequal distribution of social and environmental goods is considered unfair, it constitutes social or environmental injustice. This project has quantified inequalities in social and environmental conditions throughout rural England and identified those areas where inequalities are greatest. It has also enhanced understanding of perceptions of inequality and injustice in rural areas. The work shows how rural policy can be refined and targeted to tackle these multi-faceted problems in the most appropriate way for the benefit of society.
