These were measured using Likert-based scaling measures. An index of area performance was drawn up for the UK to construct a sampling frame for a postal questionnaire survey capable of discriminating by spatial and economic categories of interest.  The survey covered topics region, turnover, profit, type of industry, employment, quality standards, products and services, performance, skills, social contact and organisation membership, sharing of information and collaboration (with financial organisations, FE/HE, research institutes and other local, national or international companies), business support and consultancy, social capital and trust.
