This research navigates the intricacies of land use policy effectiveness in rural China, underpinned by the significant reforms initiated by the 1986 Constitution allowing transactions of land use rights.

The complexity of redeveloping brownfields in rural areas and the crucial role of rural land tenure in investment, productivity, and participation in the land rental market are also highlighted. The effectiveness of land use policies has thus become a focal point for scholarly investigation, particularly regarding the impact on rural residents, who are critical stakeholders in the reform process.\n\nCentral to this exploration is the concept of social capital, defined as the network of relationships among people who live and work in a particular society, enabling society to function effectively. Social capital, encompassing elements such as trust, social networks, and norms, plays a pivotal role in encouraging environmental restoration and climate change adaptation efforts.

The findings suggest that social capital has a contextually dependent effect on policy effectiveness, varying across different policy objectives and stages of policy evaluation.

The development of rural finance is essential to preventing the country from undergoing further polarization because of the significant potential of such development to facilitate resource interflows between rural and urban markets and to support sustainable development in the agricultural sector. However, rural finance is the weakest point in China's financial systems. Rural households are more constrained than their urban counterparts in terms of financial product availability, consumer protection, and asset accumulation. The development of the rural financial system faces resistance from both the demand and the supply sides.

The proposed project addresses this challenge by investigating the applications of a proven behavioural approach, namely, Libertarian Paternalism, in the development of rural financial systems in China. This approach promotes choice architectures to nudge people into optimal decisions without interfering with the freedom of choice. It has been rigorously tested and warmly received in the UK public policy domain. This approach also fits the political and cultural background in China, in which the central government needs to maintain a firm control over financial systems as the general public increasingly demands more freedom.

Existing behavioural studies have been heavily reliant on laboratory experiments. Although the use of field studies has been increasing, empirical evidence from the developing world is limited. Meanwhile, the applications of behavioural insights in rural economic development in China remains an uncharted territory.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Social Capital and the Effectiveness of Land Use Policies: Evidence from Rural China, 2016"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Social Capital and the Effectiveness of Land Use Policies: Evidence from Rural China, 2016"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/social-capital-and-the-effectiveness-of-land-use-policies-evidence-from-rural-china-2016"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Social Capital and the Effectiveness of Land Use Policies: Evidence from Rural China, 2016"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Social Capital and the Effectiveness of Land Use Policies: Evidence from Rural China, 2016"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
