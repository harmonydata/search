This research deployed Social Network Analysis to identify actors and their networks. Understanding these networks and roles will enable the conceptual development of a novel relational model of entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem, specifically for cultural districts.
This research will collect, via face-to-face administrated questionnaires, data on network relations of actors in the creative industries and cultural sector in George Town. We used UCINET to analyse and map this network and identify its strengths and weaknesses.
We also conducted six in-depth case studies of core actors in the networks to gain rich qualitative insights on how they build innovative and entrepreneurial networks.
The model is applicable more generally to other small/medium size towns and cities, particularly world heritage sites, where there is a potential to build a creative and cultural district empowering local residents with development opportunities in terms of culture, social and economy.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Social network data of creative industries and cultural sector in George Town UNESCO world heritage site 2017-2018"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Social network data of creative industries and cultural sector in George Town UNESCO world heritage site 2017-2018"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/social-network-data-of-creative-industries-and-cultural-sector-in-george-town-unesco-world-heritage-site-2017-2018"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Social network data of creative industries and cultural sector in George Town UNESCO world heritage site 2017-2018"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Social network data of creative industries and cultural sector in George Town UNESCO world heritage site 2017-2018"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
