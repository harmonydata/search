The study focuses on 10 social science disciplines; economics and econometrics, sociology, business and management studies, statistics and operational research, psychology, geography, social policy and administration, politics and international studies, education and accounting and finance.  The survey was undertaken in autumn 2009, with the fieldwork undertaken in the period September and October.  A sampling frame was produced on the basis of departmental staff lists.  A disproportionate probability sample was drawn, which resulted in an inflated number of data users being in the sample.  As a result, the data must be weighted prior to use. 1,001 social science academics were sampled of whom 929 were eligible.  598 responses were received.  

Topics included; where you work, facilities at your institution, working at home, about your research, using individual data, using personal data and about you. It included questions about whether the respondent conducted quantitative research and their use of data.  The focus on data use and research facilities allowed the project team to explore the extent to which current and future data access methods are compatible with the way in which researchers can use data. This information was gathered in order to inform plans for providing access to microdata, particularly those arising from the census. It is important that we understand the way in which researchers use data if we are to ensure that regulation of that behaviour is appropriate, effective and preserves the utility of data sources. 
This project seeks to explore the way in which users use data and the environment in which they do so in order to assess the extent to which registration conditions are workable or problematic. 
The project is composed of a sample survey of UK social science academics, with a target sample of 1,000. It will ask them about facilities available to them at their place of work, and whether they work away from their employer’s business, as well as asking what resources are available to their students.
Two focus groups will be undertaken to explore more complex and discursive issues, particularly those which relate to data access issues with which many researchers will not be familiar.
Respondents will not be limited to users of microdata. However, the primary goal of the research is to inform data access discussions relating to the census microdata, and more widely as we look towards the delivery of other data sources for producing census-like outputs."/><meta property="og:title" content="Social research facilities survey 2009"/><meta property="og:description" content="The Social Research Facilities Survey was undertaken under the auspices of the ESRC Census programme to obtain representative information on the work practices and working environment of social scientists in the UK.

The study focuses on 10 social science disciplines; economics and econometrics, sociology, business and management studies, statistics and operational research, psychology, geography, social policy and administration, politics and international studies, education and accounting and finance.  The survey was undertaken in autumn 2009, with the fieldwork undertaken in the period September and October.  A sampling frame was produced on the basis of departmental staff lists.  A disproportionate probability sample was drawn, which resulted in an inflated number of data users being in the sample.
