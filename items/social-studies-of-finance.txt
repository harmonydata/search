An important aspect of the Fellowship will be to encourage broader UK social-science on the financial markets.  Several disciplines have much to contribute: for example, politics, with its emphasis on the governance of markets; anthropology, with its fine-grained ethnographic studies; human geography, with its emphasis on the continuing role of particular places in apparently globalized finance.  A publicly-accessible database of existing UK work of this kind will be created, and leading scholars, newcomers, financial-market policy-makers and practitioners will be brought together in networking workshops10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Social Studies of Finance"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Social Studies of Finance"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/social-studies-of-finance"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Social Studies of Finance"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Social Studies of Finance"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
