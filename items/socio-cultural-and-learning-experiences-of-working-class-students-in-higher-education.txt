The aims of the research are to: compare and contrast the social and cultural experiences of working class students in different types of universities; explore the extent to which these experiences are gendered and if appropriate ‘raced’; discern the impact of the university experiences on the constructions and re-constructions of the students’ identities and explore the processes of compliance or resistance with which the students engage; contribute to the theoretical understanding of social class and learner identities with the higher education context.  The research takes place in three geographical areas and in different types of universities: an elite, a pre 1992 civic, a post 1992 university and an FE college.  Comparisons of the experiences are made in order to identify similarities and differences and the impact of these on students as learners and on their identities.  Foregrounding class issues and their implications for students’ learning is one of the key purposes.  However, social class and identity formations are complex. Many working class students are mature women.  Minority ethnic students also tend to be mature students.  The intersection of gender, ‘race’, ethnicity, and class is therefore central.   The research is a mainly qualitative study utilising semi and unstructured interviews with a cross section of students and also tutors.  However, a questionnaire was also used to collect a broad range of experiences and contextual data.  We also followed 27 case study students over two academic years.  We focus mainly on five disciplinary areas and undergraduates.  The project addresses an area which is under researched and therefore will make a vital contribution to knowledge that could have implications for both future quality of experience and outcomes and for student retention.  This research will explore working class students’ experiences of higher education; the impact of these on their learner and cultural identities and the implications for their progress and retention.

However, a questionnaire was also used to collect a broad range of experiences and contextual data.  We also followed 27 case study students over two academic years.  We focus mainly on five disciplinary areas and undergraduates.  The project addresses an area which is under researched and therefore will make a vital contribution to knowledge that could have implications for both future quality of experience and outcomes and for student retention.  This research will explore working class students’ experiences of higher education; the impact of these on their learner and cultural identities and the implications for their progress and retention. The research will take place across three geographical areas and in different types of HE institution. This will enable us to compare the social and cultural experiences of working class students in order to identify similarities and differences and the impact of these on the students as learners and on their identities. 

Foregrounding class issues and their implications for students’ learning is one of the key purposes of the research. However, social class and identity formations are complex. Many working class students currently in English universities are mature women. Minority ethnic students also tend to be mature students. The intersection of gender, ‘race’, ethnicity, and class is therefore central to our research. 

The research is a mainly qualitative study but will also employ quantitative methods. The HEIs will comprise an elite, ‘red brick’ and post 1992 university and a college of further education. We will focus on three disciplinary areas and if possible the same ones in each institution. Our focus is on undergraduates 18 years and above from working class backgrounds.
