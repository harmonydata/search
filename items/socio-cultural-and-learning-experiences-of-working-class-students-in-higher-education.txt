The aims of the research are to: compare and contrast the social and cultural experiences of working class students in different types of universities; explore the extent to which these experiences are gendered and if appropriate ‘raced’; discern the impact of the university experiences on the constructions and re-constructions of the students’ identities and explore the processes of compliance or resistance with which the students engage; contribute to the theoretical understanding of social class and learner identities with the higher education context.  The research takes place in three geographical areas and in different types of universities: an elite, a pre 1992 civic, a post 1992 university and an FE college.  Comparisons of the experiences are made in order to identify similarities and differences and the impact of these on students as learners and on their identities.  Foregrounding class issues and their implications for students’ learning is one of the key purposes.  However, social class and identity formations are complex. Many working class students are mature women.  Minority ethnic students also tend to be mature students.  The intersection of gender, ‘race’, ethnicity, and class is therefore central.   The research is a mainly qualitative study utilising semi and unstructured interviews with a cross section of students and also tutors.  However, a questionnaire was also used to collect a broad range of experiences and contextual data.  We also followed 27 case study students over two academic years.
