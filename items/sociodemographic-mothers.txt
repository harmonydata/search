Longitudinal Study of Parents & Children (ALSPAC)","description":"The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a transgenerational prospective observational study investigating influences on health and development across the life course. It considers multiple genetic, epigenetic, biological, psychological, social and other environmental exposures in relation to a similarly diverse range of health, social and developmental outcomes.\n\nBased at the University of Bristol, the ALSPAC is a world-leading birth cohort study. Between April 1991 and December 1992 more than 14,000 pregnant women were recruited into the study and these women (some of whom had two pregnancies or multiple births during the recruitment period), the children arising from the pregnancy, and their partners have been followed up intensively over two decades.\n\nStudy website: https://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/","url":["","http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/)","https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.alspac/c6601e78-0f74-446a-a5f1-7c73a1984b4e","https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=ALSPAC","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=ALSPAC"],"keywords":["Diet and nutrition","Covid-19 data collection","Biomarkers","Cognitive measures","Work and employment","Puberty","Social care - receipt","Political and social attitudes","Parenting and family","Social care - provision","Sexuality and gender identity","Education","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Reproductive health","Loneliness and social isolation","Digital technology and social media","Language and literacy","Physical health assessment","Housing","Sleep problems","Social care - need","Victimisation and life events","Ethnicity and race","Neighbourhood"],"identifier":["https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dys064","https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dys066","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15132.1","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16950.1"],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"CLOSER Discovery","url":"https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.alspac/c6601e78-0f74-446a-a5f1-7c73a1984b4e","image":"https://closer.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/closer-2022/www/images/closer-logo-full.svg"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration: UK LLC","url":"https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=ALSPAC","image":"https://ukllc.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/ukllc-theme/assets/images/UKLLC_Logo_Landscape_Black.svg"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=ALSPAC","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"}],"publisher":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Professor George Davy Smith, Professor Nic Timpson"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol "},{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol"}],"funder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Medical Research Council"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Wellcome Trust"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"MRC Wellcome BristolUni"}],"copyrightHolder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Bristol "}],"license":["http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/access/"],"image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/ALSPAC.png","size":"19982"},"extra_data":{"keywords":["Diet and nutrition","Covid-19 data collection","Biomarkers","Cognitive measures","Work and employment","Puberty","Social care - receipt","Political and social attitudes","Parenting and family","Social care - provision","Sexuality and gender identity","Education","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Reproductive health","Loneliness and social isolation","Digital technology and social media","Language and literacy","Physical health assessment","Housing","Sleep problems","Social care - need","Victimisation and life events","Ethnicity and race","Neighbourhood"],"instruments":[],"study_design":[],"country_codes":["GB"],"resource_type":"study","source":["ukds","mhc","ukllc","closer"],"name":"Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents & Children (ALSPAC)","uuid":"1bcff6f4d91dc98f895f10c377fb1b8d","number_of_variables":67311},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]}]}}]]}]
