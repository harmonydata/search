We used an apparent motion paradigm to test this prediction. This dataset contains the anonymised data from 11 autistic and 9 non-autistic participants, who took part in an apparent motion paradigm similar to the one presented by Sanders et al., 2012) to participants with Schizophrenia. The participants had to detect a flashing stimulus, that appeared either in-time (predictable) or out-of-time (unpredictable) with the apparent motion. We observed that 66% (6/9) neurotypical and (64%) 7/11 autistic participants were better at detecting predictable targets.  Thus, autistic participants were likely able to use the apparent motion to establish a predictive model of the stimuli, benefiting their ability to detect the predictable over the unpredictable target. Additionally,  55% (6/11) of autistic participants had faster responses for unpredictable targets, whereas only 22% (2/9) neurotypicals had faster responses to unpredictable compared to predictable targets.
