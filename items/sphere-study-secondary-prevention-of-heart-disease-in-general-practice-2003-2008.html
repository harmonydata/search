The aim of the study was to design, implement and test the effectiveness of a complex intervention to improve the process of care and objective clinical outcomes for patients with established coronary heart disease in primary care.

The SPHERE intervention was designed in consultation with patients and practitioners. Based on principles of patient-centred care, brief motivational interviewing and best practice in medication prescribing, it has the following components:  

1. Practitioners attend two 90-minute training sessions, the first on facilitating lifestyle behaviour change, and the second on optimal medication prescribing for secondary prevention
2. Patients visit the practice for review every four months
3. Ongoing support is provided to practitioners by regional SPHERE research nurses
4. A study newsletter is circulated to intervention practices every four months

Patients with established coronary heart disease were selected from 48 general practices taking part in the study in the East, North and West Ireland. Half the practices were randomly chosen to receive the intervention for 18 months, while the other half continued to provide usual care to their patients. Detailed information about patient risk factors and health status was collected at the beginning of the study and again at the end. 

Further information, including results and publications, can be found on the SPHERE study website.

 The dataset includes a number of outcome measures recorded at the baseline and followed-up after 18 months.

Primary outcomes include: blood pressure; total cholesterol; physical and mental status as measured by the SF-12; hospital re-admissions

Secondary outcomes include: measure of the process of care: SPHERE visits; total number of GP visits; total number of hospital OPD visits; recording of risk factors in GP records; Body Mass Index/Waist-Hip Ratio; exercise: Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire; smoking status; diet: Dietary Instrument for Nutrition Education (DINE), including question regarding portions of fresh fruit and vegetables; adherence to medication (Medication Adherence Report Scale MARS-5).

Other variable types include: cardiovascular medication prescribing; cardiovascular history; multi-morbidities; family history premature cardiovascular mortality; spending on behaviours influencing cardiovascular risk factors."/><meta property="og:title" content="SPHERE Study: Secondary Prevention of Heart Disease in General Practice, 2003-2008"/><meta property="og:description" content="The SPHERE Study: Secondary Prevention of Heart Disease in General Practice,  was the largest ever non-pharmaceutical trial in Irish general practice.
