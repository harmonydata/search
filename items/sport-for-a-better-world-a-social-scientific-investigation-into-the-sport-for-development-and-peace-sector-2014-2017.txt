A project documentation file includes information on the projects methods, participant information sheet, a blank consent form and fieldwork schedules. In addition to data collected within the research locations, a transcription of the projects final dissemination event is provided.The Sport for Development and Peace (SDP) sector features hundreds of programmes and organizations across the world which use sport as a tool of social intervention to promote non-sport goals such as development, peace, human rights and social justice. Key SDP stakeholders - in facilitating, delivering or receiving this work - include national governments, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, private corporations, campaign groups, and SDP user groups. Despite its rapid growth, we have limited knowledge of: how the SDP sector is structured socially and organizationally; and how different kinds of SDP work are planned, implemented, and experienced in diverse cultural contexts. This knowledge is essential if robust policies and practices for the future development of SDP are to be identified. The broad aims of this project are to fill that knowledge gap by providing the first substantial comparative social scientific investigation of SDP, and to have long-term impact on the sector's development. The project will build on our significant prior research on SDP and be facilitated through our excellent links with key SDP stakeholders. Our project aims are underpinned by five specific project objectives:\n1: To examine how the SDP sector is constructed in social and organizational terms.  Research will examine the different policies and ideologies of SDP stakeholders; the networking, collaboration, and power relations across stakeholders; how particular stakeholders are included or excluded from different networks and activities; how the sector may become more effective through new types of partnership; and how the SDP sector's social and organizational features change over time. 2: To examine SDP comparatively with regard to three major fields of activity: empowering people with disabilities; peacebuilding and conflict resolution; and advancing human rights. Each field of activity will be studied in five selected research locations. Research will explore how SDP stakeholders understand each field; the particular types of SDP work in each field; the difficulties and problems encountered, and how these are responded to; the philosophies and reflective practices of SDP officials on their work; and, how these issues and questions develop over time.\n3: To examine SDP programmes with regard to their organization, implementation and user-group experiences. Thus, we shall investigate the 'top-down' and 'bottom-up' aspects of SDP programmes. Research will examine the different influences of SDP stakeholders in identifying local needs and shaping SDP work, relative to context; how user groups are engaged and empowered in planning and implementing SDP work; how wider community groups understand SDP work; and, how these and other aspects of the SDP sector develop over time.\n4: To examine comparatively SDP work in five selected national settings. These locations will enable us to examine: key contextual issues that impact on SDP interventions and whether SDP work is adapted to these conditions; how SDP organizations engage (or otherwise) with other local actors; and, the actual and potential roles of national and local government in facilitating SDP work.\n5: To produce research findings that deliver major academic impacts, and which influence as well as understand the SDP sector. We shall identify practical ways in which the SDP sector should move forward, for example through: better policy, planning and partnerships; engaging a wider pool of stakeholders; more contextualised implementation of 'best practices'; and enhanced ethics in the planning, delivery, and evaluation of SDP work. Findings will be disseminated through leading academic journals, books and conferences; a project symposium; policy briefings and other reports to user groups; and online forums and wider media.

Work with non-academic users will be guided by our impact plans.18:T1135,This data has been collected from 5 international research locations. Data was also collected from European Stakeholders. Data includes anonymised transcribed formal interviews, informal interviews and field notes. A project documentation file includes information on the projects methods, participant information sheet, a blank consent form and fieldwork schedules. In addition to data collected within the research locations, a transcription of the projects final dissemination event is provided.The Sport for Development and Peace (SDP) sector features hundreds of programmes and organizations across the world which use sport as a tool of social intervention to promote non-sport goals such as development, peace, human rights and social justice. Key SDP stakeholders - in facilitating, delivering or receiving this work - include national governments, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, private corporations, campaign groups, and SDP user groups. Despite its rapid growth, we have limited knowledge of: how the SDP sector is structured socially and organizationally; and how different kinds of SDP work are planned, implemented, and experienced in diverse cultural contexts. This knowledge is essential if robust policies and practices for the future development of SDP are to be identified. The broad aims of this project are to fill that knowledge gap by providing the first substantial comparative social scientific investigation of SDP, and to have long-term impact on the sector's development. The project will build on our significant prior research on SDP and be facilitated through our excellent links with key SDP stakeholders. Our project aims are underpinned by five specific project objectives:
1: To examine how the SDP sector is constructed in social and organizational terms.  Research will examine the different policies and ideologies of SDP stakeholders; the networking, collaboration, and power relations across stakeholders; how particular stakeholders are included or excluded from different networks and activities; how the sector may become more effective through new types of partnership; and how the SDP sector's social and organizational features change over time. 2: To examine SDP comparatively with regard to three major fields of activity: empowering people with disabilities; peacebuilding and conflict resolution; and advancing human rights. Each field of activity will be studied in five selected research locations. Research will explore how SDP stakeholders understand each field; the particular types of SDP work in each field; the difficulties and problems encountered, and how these are responded to; the philosophies and reflective practices of SDP officials on their work; and, how these issues and questions develop over time.
3: To examine SDP programmes with regard to their organization, implementation and user-group experiences. Thus, we shall investigate the 'top-down' and 'bottom-up' aspects of SDP programmes. Research will examine the different influences of SDP stakeholders in identifying local needs and shaping SDP work, relative to context; how user groups are engaged and empowered in planning and implementing SDP work; how wider community groups understand SDP work; and, how these and other aspects of the SDP sector develop over time.
4: To examine comparatively SDP work in five selected national settings. These locations will enable us to examine: key contextual issues that impact on SDP interventions and whether SDP work is adapted to these conditions; how SDP organizations engage (or otherwise) with other local actors; and, the actual and potential roles of national and local government in facilitating SDP work.
5: To produce research findings that deliver major academic impacts, and which influence as well as understand the SDP sector. We shall identify practical ways in which the SDP sector should move forward, for example through: better policy, planning and partnerships; engaging a wider pool of stakeholders; more contextualised implementation of 'best practices'; and enhanced ethics in the planning, delivery, and evaluation of SDP work. Findings will be disseminated through leading academic journals, books and conferences; a project symposium; policy briefings and other reports to user groups; and online forums and wider media. Work with non-academic users will be guided by our impact plans.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Sport for a better world?
