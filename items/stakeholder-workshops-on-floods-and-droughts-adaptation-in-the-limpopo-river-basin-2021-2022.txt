WP1 will assess basin-scale hydrological connectivity, i.e. how droughts and floods propagate in space and time under varying physical conditions (hydrometeorology, physiography, geology, groundwater-surface water interactions), with a focus on how the hydrological response of a specific sub-region influences or is influenced by other regions. This will be achieved though implementation of a basin-scale groundwater-surface water modelling approach and based on existing datasets, in part collected by the project team.

WP2 will assess the basin-scale social connectivity, i.e. how drought-flood cycles are understood, anticipated and worked with by local communities and how these communities interact with governance institutions. This will be achieved by carrying out interviews with diverse community groups and with key community-government intermediaries such as extension officers and catchment management fora. Outputs will contribute to understanding how drought/flood risk is perceived by communities and to develop better communication.

Floods and droughts have been shown to exacerbate water availability and quality problems and are predicted to increase in frequency and magnitude.

We will focus on the challenges and opportunities during floods following droughts in the LRB, when aquifers and communities are already under stress, and when appropriate flood management could improve short term coping mechanisms and long-term resilience for future dry seasons. We will explore to what extent geographical differences between sub-regions influence how water resources respond to, and how people cope with floods and droughts in order to inform appropriate water management strategies at various scales (local to transnational).

The research will articulate around three integrated workpackages (WP).
 
WP1 will assess basin-scale hydrological connectivity, i.e. how droughts and floods propagate in space and time under varying physical conditions (hydrometeorology, physiography, geology, groundwater-surface water interactions), with a focus on how the hydrological response of a specific sub-region influences or is influenced by other regions. This will be achieved though implementation of a basin-scale groundwater-surface water modelling approach and based on existing datasets, in part collected by the project team. Outputs will aid to improve transnational flood and drought monitoring networks and update susceptibility mapping.

WP2 will assess the basin-scale social connectivity, i.e. how drought-flood cycles are understood, anticipated and worked with by local communities and how these communities interact with governance institutions. This will be achieved by carrying out interviews with diverse community groups and with key community-government intermediaries such as extension officers and catchment management fora. Outputs will contribute to understanding how drought/flood risk is perceived by communities and to develop better communication.

WP3 will integrate WP1 and WP2 and will work on the connectivity between social and hydrological systems.18:T1231,The collection contains a summary of the stakeholder interactive sessions on floods and droughts adaptation in the Limpopo River Basin, Southern Africa, held at national and transboundary levels during the period 2021-2022, as part of the NERC-funded Connect4WR project.

Workshops aimed to co-create management solutions to reduce impacts and increase benefits of drought-flood cycles throughout the Limpopo River Basin. They explored the combination of suitable and widely supported engineering and soft-path management solutions using an iterative, coproduction process to strengthen bridges between scientists and water management stakeholders at local, national and transboundary scales. Three specific key questions were considered: (i) How can the increased understanding of historic drought-flood cycles be used for the development of future management scenarios?; (ii) Which processes and communication pathways can be developed or improved between managers/policy makers and local water uses to reduce negative impacts and increase resilience towards drought-flood cycles?; (iii) How can long-term transboundary physical and social connections be built to increase basin-scale resilience to alternating hydrological extremes?

The collection contains four datasets:
(1) Summary of the transboundary stakeholder interactive sessions run virtually on 2-3 June 2021, in partnership with LIMCOM, IWMI and the SADC's Groundwater Management Institute.
(2) Summary of the South Africa stakeholder interactive sessions run virtually on 25 April 2022.
(3) Summary of the Botswana stakeholder interactive sessions run virtually and in person (i.e. hybrid) on 5 May 2022.
(4) Summary of the Zimbabwe stakeholder interactive sessions run virtually on 12 May 2022.The 'CONNECT4 water resilience' project brings together a multidisciplinary team of hydrologists and sociologists from academia, policy and practice in the UK, Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique to investigate the physical and societal factors affecting vulnerability and resilience to drought and floods in 4 countries of the Limpopo River Basin (LRB). The research will provide a better understanding of the connectivity within and between physical and social aspects of vulnerability to improve societal preparedness and resilience to flood and drought hazards in arid Sub-Saharan regions.
 
The LRB is an arid, water-stressed basin, yet with high susceptibility to floods. It encompasses a large diversity of physical and socio-economical characteristics spread across four countries (Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique). Floods and droughts have been shown to exacerbate water availability and quality problems and are predicted to increase in frequency and magnitude.

We will focus on the challenges and opportunities during floods following droughts in the LRB, when aquifers and communities are already under stress, and when appropriate flood management could improve short term coping mechanisms and long-term resilience for future dry seasons.
