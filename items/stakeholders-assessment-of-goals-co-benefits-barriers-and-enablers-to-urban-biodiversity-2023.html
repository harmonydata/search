This data set is part of the BiUrbs project. It details stakeholder’s rankings of importance of various goals, co-benefits, barriers and enablers related to delivery of biodiversity in urban contexts through new development.  It was designed to generate a better understanding of the relative importance of the wide range of factors that might influence biodiversity delivery in urban development and redevelopment. 

To approach this question, we employed the Delphi methodology of stakeholder assessment with controlled feedback. This entailed 1) the synthesis of potential goals, co-benefits, barriers and enablers from existing literature and a stakeholder workshop 2) the assessment of these for importance via a survey 3) the re-assessment of these through a second survey in which participants were provided with the median importance score from the first round. The results of this second round are provided here. Our assessment used medians of this second round as the assessment of importance and the interquartile range as the assessment of consensus between participants. Participants were stakeholders in the built environment across construction, planning local government, housing associations and environmental consultants. 

The Delphi method is a structured communication process that aims to generate insight regarding current or future challenges. It is particularly useful in situations where there is lack of readily available information on the current challenge as whole (Beiderbeck et al, 2021). These methods are used to promote the generation of a reliable consensus viewpoint from stakeholders where possible and capturing differences of opinion between panel members. 

Beiderbeck D., et al.  Preparing, conducting, and analyzing Delphi surveys: Cross-disciplinary practices, new directions, and advancements. MethodsX. 2021;8:101401.Biurbs - valuing biodiversity in multi-functional urban development and environments

The UK Government&#x27;s Nature Positive 2030 report recommends businesses, organisations, cities, and local authorities adopt targets to become Nature Positive - putting the crises of biodiversity loss and climate change on an equal footing. There is a gap between this national level ambition to enhance biodiversity and implementation on the ground, particularly evident in urban environments. 

Densification or the compact city approach is a main strategy for urban development. Urbanisation and densification have resulted in environmental degradation and severe habitat fragmentation in towns and cities. This impacts the resilience of remaining bio-diversity pockets and diminishes the effectiveness of proposed enhancements. The failure to move towards a system of net environmental gain in development risks undermining the government&#x27;s plans for a green recovery.

Biodiversity may benefit other eco-system services, such as sustainable drainage, outdoor recreation, and noise and heat attenuation, yet the economic value of biodiversity is undercounted in existing planning tools. Furthermore, there is a need to understand the spatial needs of the eco-system services and different types of biodiversity to ensure that they function as intended and are resilient over the long-term. Such an integrated approach will recognise both synergistic benefits and trade-offs that will be critical in understanding local vs national or global benefits.

Biurbs is co-led by a multi-disciplinary team of leading researchers from across the country and innovative architecture and green infrastructure practitioners. The research engages with decision makers and stakeholders, to help inform practical, well-grounded tools and guidance. The research assesses the economic value of these benefits to different land-uses. It considers different biodiversity conservation practices as part of an integrated suite of eco-system services, and where these practices may be best implemented through new development/regeneration. The research examines micro (site) and meso (local neighbourhoods) spatial scales and examine land-uses within these areas, namely: residential, industry &amp; commerce, community &amp; public buildings, transport &amp; infrastructure, outdoor recreation. Twenty exemplary real world urban sites will be examined, and lessons learned. Two sites are to be examined in-depth to assess how the state-of-the-art approach to biodiversity improvement can be integrated into planning and how this impacts the economics of urban land-uses."/><meta property="og:title" content="Stakeholders’ Assessment of Goals, Co-Benefits, Barriers and Enablers to Urban Biodiversity, 2023"/><meta property="og:description" content="Despite the increasing importance and attention paid to the issue of delivering biodiversity, less attention has been given to how biodiversity will be protected and enhanced during developed and redevelopment in an urban context.
