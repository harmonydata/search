The new statistics remedy these deficiencies. Three types of table are presented. The first disaggregates, and where necessary corrects, the official annual statistics of stocks of outstanding debt of each Australian colony, distinguishing between the place of original sale, long and short-term securities, and gross new issues (i.e. the nominal value of all securities sold) and repayments. The second shows the stocks of long and short term debt held in Australia and the United Kingdom. These are taken principally from Statistical Registers, and include debt (e.g. stock issued by Savings Banks) omitted from the official statistics in the early years. The final type of table summarises the principal annual flows in London of capital created (including as a result of conversions and exchanges), subscribed, received, and amortized for each colonial government and for public corporations as a single group. It excludes flows arising from remittance of securities originally sold in the colonies, but includes transfers from London to colonial registers and purchases from sinking funds where they are known. The data is presented in 18 spreadsheets and are of seven separate borrowers: New South Wales (3 spreadsheets), Victoria (3), Queensland (3), South Australia (3), Tasmania (2), Western Australia (2), and public corporations (1).
