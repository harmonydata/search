Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
Student activities and careers; attitude towards degree of student representation or consultation on appointment of principal and teaching staff; disciplining students; running library; teaching arrangements and course content (5 options for each). A section is included to discover what factors respondent feels should ideally be in a degree course and, how important he feels these actually are on present course (i.e. 7 statements - respondent attitudes towards importance of each is measured on a 5-point scale). Whether seeking any position in students&#x27; union of college, how respondent intends to divide time between studying and social activities (5 categories, e.g. &#x27;Mostly study with some social life&#x27;), expectation of future standard of living (economic income) compared with that of family in which brought up (3 categories), type of organisation that respondent would most like to work in and type actually expects to end up working in (8 options). Also measured are attitudes towards differences between polytechnics and universities (a group of statements - e.g. &#x27;Polytechnic graduates will obtain entry to the career of their choice easier than graduates from universities&#x27; - respondents are asked whether each is &#x27;true&#x27;, &#x27;no difference&#x27; or `opposite is true&#x27;).
Social/political data: which political party respondent would vote for if there was a general election tomorrow; voting behaviour of parents; whether respondent believes in any religious or ethnic value system (6 categories); frequency of attendance of self and parents at religious services. Respondent attitudes towards demonstrations (a list of 6 recent demonstrations is given and respondents asked whether &#x27;favour&#x27;, &#x27;indifferent&#x27;, &#x27;disfavour&#x27; each); whether agrees with strategy of sit-ins to influence college policy, attitudes towards non-violent direct action (i.e. whether can be justified in certain circumstances in Britain today), and violent direct action (i.e. use of physical force for political ends). A list of 10 statements is included covering issues such as comprehensive education, legalisation of marihuana, corporal and capital punishment: respondents are asked to state whether they agree or disagree with each. Attitudes towards the use of drugs is more finely tested in the next section which gives data on the frequency of use of drugs, alcohol and cigarettes. Self perception: respondents are presented with a list of 10 pairs of adjectives, (e.g. weak - strong, imaginative - unimaginative) and are asked to mark off on a 5-point scale between the two extremes, their ideal self and their actual personality. Respondents are then asked to make similar judgements about different types of people. The stereotypes are: engineer; sociologist; left wing militant; economist and marihuana-smoking `hippy&#x27;.
Educational history: type of secondary school last attended (8 categories); age left school; any other educational establishment attended after leaving school; whether has previously applied to read for a degree at a university or polytechnic (details recorded); whether taken ONC or OND examinations (subjects and grades recorded); whether taken &#x27;A&#x27; level examinations (subjects and grades recorded).
Background Variables
Sex, date of birth, country of origin, marital status, whether has children, ethnic origin of parents, present term-time residence (6 categories), course being followed (accountancy, sociology, business studies, engineering), whether repeating a year on this course.
