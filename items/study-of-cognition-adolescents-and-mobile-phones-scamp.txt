This prospective cohort study is school-based and involves tracking several thousand students over time. The primary focus of SCAMP is to investigate the potential associations between exposure to radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) from mobile phones and other wireless devices, and various outcomes in adolescents. These outcomes include cognitive development, behavioral patterns, educational achievements, and physical and mental health. By examining these associations, SCAMP seeks to provide valuable insights into how modern technology might influence adolescent development and well-being, contributing to the broader understanding of technology's impact on health."}}]]
