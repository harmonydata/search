In total, 1,661 providers completed child questionnaires, which equates to a response rate of 62 per cent.Latest Edition InformationFor the second edition (December 2018), 5 variables covering wave 2 settings, the Sustained Shared Thinking and Emotional Well-being scale and the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale have been added to the study and the documentation has been enhanced.  The Wave 2 questionnaire includes the following sections:childcaremeasures (includes a Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for parents and providers)home environmentchild healthparent/carer health and cognitive difficulties (includes Kessler 6 Inventory)parenting/caringsocio-demographicsBritish Ability Scale (BAS III)18:Tc06,The Study of Early Education and Development (SEED) is a major study about early years education and its impacts on child development. It is funded by the Department for Education and is undertaken by NatCen Social Research, the University of Oxford, Action for Children and Frontier Economics. The study follows just under 6,000 children across England from the age of two, through to their early years at school.

The aims of SEED are to:provide evidence of the impact of current early years provision on
children’s outcomesprovide a basis for longitudinal assessment of the impact of early years
provision on later attainmentinform policy development to improve children’s readiness for schoolassess the role and influence of the quality of early education provision on
children’s outcomesassess the overall value for money of early education in England and the
relative value for money associated with different types (e.g. private,
voluntary, maintained) and quality of provisionexplore how parenting and the home learning environment interacts with early years education in affecting children’s outcomesThe longitudinal survey of families collects information at four time points: when the families’ child is about two years old (Wave 1 – baseline) (SN 8277) when the child is about three years old (Wave 2) (SN 8278) when the child is about four years old (Wave 3) when the child is about five years old (Wave 4) Data for Wave 4 are not available yet.

Further information and research from the study are available on the GOV.UK and NatCen webpages.

The Study of Early Education and Development: Wave 2, 2014-2015 is the second survey in the series. In total, 4,583 parents took part in the Wave 2 survey and the overall response rate was 82 per cent. Once weighted, the Wave 2 sample of families taking part in SEED is representative of all families with three-year-olds in England.
In addition to collecting data from families, the SEED survey also collected data from staff at group settings attended by children in the SEED study (provided consent was given by the parent/main carer of the child). Staff were sent Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires for each child in the SEED study who was attending their setting at the time of the age 3 interview. The staff survey was by post, with some telephone calls to encourage completion. In total, 1,661 providers completed child questionnaires, which equates to a response rate of 62 per cent.Latest Edition InformationFor the second edition (December 2018), 5 variables covering wave 2 settings, the Sustained Shared Thinking and Emotional Well-being scale and the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale have been added to the study and the documentation has been enhanced.  The Wave 2 questionnaire includes the following sections:childcaremeasures (includes a Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for parents and providers)home environmentchild healthparent/carer health and cognitive difficulties (includes Kessler 6 Inventory)parenting/caringsocio-demographicsBritish Ability Scale (BAS III)e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Study of Early Education and Development: Wave 2,\n2014-2015"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Study of Early Education and Development: Wave 2,\n2014-2015"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/study-of-early-education-and-development-wave-2-2014-2015"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Study of Early Education and Development: Wave 2,\n2014-2015"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Study of Early Education and Development: Wave 2,\n2014-2015"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
