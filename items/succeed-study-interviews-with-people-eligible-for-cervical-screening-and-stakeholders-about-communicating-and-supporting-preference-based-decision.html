This population could soon be offered at-home self-sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) as an alternative to in-clinic testing. It needs to be carefully planned to support equitable and person-centred participation. Aims: To identify optimal methods of communicating cervical screening programme changes, and to understand the needs of individuals with a cervix regarding a combined behaviour change and preference- based decision support tool when presented with a choice of cervical screening method. Approach: Qualitative methodology using semi-structured interviews with 30 cervical screening eligible individuals purposively recruited for diversity and twenty-one interviews with stakeholders. Topics explored: topics raised in interviews included: For cervical screening-eligible participants:  Attitudes to HPV self sampling and clinician sampling in cervical screening; communication preferences for introduction of HPV self-sampling and decision support needs for choice in screening method. With stakeholders: perceived decision needs of people in cervical screening; barriers to HPV self-sampling; system implications of HPV self-sampling; cultural sensitivities around cervical screening; optimisation of implementing interventions for choice in screening modality. Key findings: to be published, see here for updates: https://succeed1.yolasite.com/Cervical cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer in individuals with a cervix under 45 years of age in the UK. Cervical screening using HPV testing is routinely offered to individuals with a cervix between the ages of 25 and 64 years in the UK via the NHS cancer screening programmes. The cervical screening eligible population could for the first time have a choice of cervical screening modality; in-clinic or self-sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV). To date, no intervention has integrated behaviour change techniques with decision support principles to support equitable participation in cervical screening, whilst also promoting informed screening modality choice.
The study aims to identify optimal methods of communicating cervical screening programme changes, and to understand the needs of individuals with a cervix regarding a combined behaviour change and preference- based decision support tool when presented with a choice of cervical screening method.
A qualitative approach will be used for the study. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a diverse sample of the cervical screening-eligible population as well as with key stakeholders. Following thematic analysis, the results will be used to develop a logic model for the active components needed for an intervention to support decisions about screening modality."/><meta property="og:title" content="SUCCEED Study: Interviews with People Eligible for Cervical Screening and Stakeholders About Communicating and Supporting Preference-Based Decision Making for Cervical Screening, 2023-2024"/><meta property="og:description" content="Motivation: Individuals aged 25-64 years are offered cervical screening via NHS screening programmes, however uptake is suboptimal.

This population could soon be offered at-home self-sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) as an alternative to in-clinic testing.

Aims: To identify optimal methods of communicating cervical screening programme changes, and to understand the needs of individuals with a cervix regarding a combined behaviour change and preference- based decision support tool when presented with a choice of cervical screening method. Approach: Qualitative methodology using semi-structured interviews with 30 cervical screening eligible individuals purposively recruited for diversity and twenty-one interviews with stakeholders. Topics explored: topics raised in interviews included: For cervical screening-eligible participants:  Attitudes to HPV self sampling and clinician sampling in cervical screening; communication preferences for introduction of HPV self-sampling and decision support needs for choice in screening method. With stakeholders: perceived decision needs of people in cervical screening; barriers to HPV self-sampling; system implications of HPV self-sampling; cultural sensitivities around cervical screening; optimisation of implementing interventions for choice in screening modality.
