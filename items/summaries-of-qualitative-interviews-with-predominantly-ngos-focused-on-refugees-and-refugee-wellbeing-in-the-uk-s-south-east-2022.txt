These approximately 90-minute interviews were undertaken to explore the wellbeing issues that effect the asylum seeker and refugee communities most significantly. All personal identifiable information was removed from the interview summaries. Within the overview dataset of the interviews, the following information is detailed: the organisation name; the organisation type; the location that organisation operates in; who that organisation works with; the countries mentioned where the refugee and asylum seeker populations supported originate from; the activities that organisation partakes in to improve wellbeing; the factors discussed which effect the wellbeing of refugee and asylum seeker populations in general.This research directly addresses the 'Sustainability, equity, wellbeing and cultural connections' aspects identified in the call. It investigates through what processes forcibly displaced people become part of cities, in ways that sustainably contribute to economic development, cultural advancement and wellbeing. To this end, we will build a detailed understanding of the relations between placemaking processes, modalities of reception and wellbeing outcomes for displaced groups in Indian and European cities. We do this in a context of rapidly growing human displacement, forced migration and refugee flows to cities globally, and in European and Indian cities that are witnessing rising inequalities.\n\nThe research objectives, in approximate order of importance, are:\n \n(i) Gain a deep understanding of the material and cultural production, design and architectural organisation of urban spaces of displacement and placemaking processes. \n(ii) Critically examine the ways in which these spaces and the displaced people in them are governed, through assemblages of actors and particular modalities of reception, to produce particular wellbeing effects. \n(iii) Assess in what ways and why displaced people negotiate access to these spaces. \n(iv) Develop, design and build strategic interventions that foster equity and inclusion in urban spaces, grounded in the wellbeing priorities of vulnerable displaced groups. \n(v) Build student and academic capacity for current and future cross- and trans-disciplinary research, design and learning relating to migration management in cities.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the study is guided by an overarching research question: How to curate processes that foster displaced people to become part of the city, and to sustainably contribute to its economic development, socio-cultural cohesion and wellbeing? This question is broken down into four sub-questions: \n\n1. Through what kinds of placemaking processes in physical and digital spaces do displaced people inhabit, build, make, give meaning and derive wellbeing?\n2. In what ways and why do modalities of reception structure economic participation, socio-cultural cohesion and wellbeing outcomes for displaced people? \n3. What is the role of urban informality, temporality and scale in placemaking processes and in the visions and functioning of modalities of reception?\n4. What strategic architectural and policy interventions can advance equity and wellbeing for displaced communities in urban spaces?\nThese questions, along with the wellbeing framework and the highly interdisciplinary methods that the study proposes, ensure that it addresses cross-cutting issues and themes highlighted by the study call, including urban inequalities, the (formal and informal) urban governance features, and practices that interact with vulnerable groups as they are engaged in placemaking processes to critically shape equity and wellbeing outcomes. \n\nThe project will convene European and Indian social science and humanities research communities to jointly conduct cross-country investigations into urban protracted displacement across lower-middle income (India) and higher income countries (Finland, Norway, UK).

(ii) Critically examine the ways in which these spaces and the displaced people in them are governed, through assemblages of actors and particular modalities of reception, to produce particular wellbeing effects. 
(iii) Assess in what ways and why displaced people negotiate access to these spaces. 
(iv) Develop, design and build strategic interventions that foster equity and inclusion in urban spaces, grounded in the wellbeing priorities of vulnerable displaced groups. 
(v) Build student and academic capacity for current and future cross- and trans-disciplinary research, design and learning relating to migration management in cities.

To achieve these objectives, the study is guided by an overarching research question: How to curate processes that foster displaced people to become part of the city, and to sustainably contribute to its economic development, socio-cultural cohesion and wellbeing? This question is broken down into four sub-questions: 

1. Through what kinds of placemaking processes in physical and digital spaces do displaced people inhabit, build, make, give meaning and derive wellbeing?
2. In what ways and why do modalities of reception structure economic participation, socio-cultural cohesion and wellbeing outcomes for displaced people? 
3. What is the role of urban informality, temporality and scale in placemaking processes and in the visions and functioning of modalities of reception?
4. What strategic architectural and policy interventions can advance equity and wellbeing for displaced communities in urban spaces?
These questions, along with the wellbeing framework and the highly interdisciplinary methods that the study proposes, ensure that it addresses cross-cutting issues and themes highlighted by the study call, including urban inequalities, the (formal and informal) urban governance features, and practices that interact with vulnerable groups as they are engaged in placemaking processes to critically shape equity and wellbeing outcomes. 

The project will convene European and Indian social science and humanities research communities to jointly conduct cross-country investigations into urban protracted displacement across lower-middle income (India) and higher income countries (Finland, Norway, UK). The comparative case study analysis across cities of various scales (from town to megacity) will advance new empirical, conceptual and theoretical insights. 

This project also offers a unique approach to analysis and capacity building, making sure that the insights and skills gained amongst the consortium will last beyond the end of the project. We will systematically pair senior researchers and students from Architecture and Design studies and Social Sciences to advance a highly inter-disciplinary approach that has great potential to generate new insights and to advance architectural and policy solutions that address growing urban inequalities and economic development, and improve equity and socio-cultural wellbeing in a sustainable manner.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Summaries of Qualitative Interviews With Predominantly NGOs Focused on Refugees and Refugee Wellbeing in the UK's South East, 2022"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Summaries of Qualitative Interviews With Predominantly NGOs Focused on Refugees and Refugee Wellbeing in the UK's South East, 2022"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/summaries-of-qualitative-interviews-with-predominantly-ngos-focused-on-refugees-and-refugee-wellbeing-in-the-uk-s-south-east-2022"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Summaries of Qualitative Interviews With Predominantly NGOs Focused on Refugees and Refugee Wellbeing in the UK's South East, 2022"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Summaries of Qualitative Interviews With Predominantly NGOs Focused on Refugees and Refugee Wellbeing in the UK's South East, 2022"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
