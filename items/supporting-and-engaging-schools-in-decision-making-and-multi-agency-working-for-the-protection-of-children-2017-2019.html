The first data set is 17 transcripts taken from &#x27;scoping&#x27; interviews with local authority education and children&#x27;s social care staff. The findings of these interviews were used to inform the second phase of data collection involving national surveys of: (a) local authority education safeguarding leads; (b) children&#x27;s social care leads; and (c) Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs). This is the second data set. The third phase of the project involved interviews with key staff involved in safeguarding and child protection work in 50 schools spread across 5 local authority areas. Staff were also asked to complete the Organisational Social Context questionnaire. The interview transcripts and questionnaire results from these case studies are included here as the third and forth data sets.Schools are an important source for the identification, referral and management of child protection concerns. Yet schools often lack robust arrangements for working in partnership with children&#x27;s social care departments and/or find it difficult to implement these effectively (Baginsky, 2007; Ward, Brown &amp; Maskell-Graham, 2012). A recent major review identified a lack of engagement by schools with safeguarding, despite the statutory framework to promote inter-agency co-operation (Davies and Ward, 2012). Furthermore, in recent years state-funded schools have been able to sever their links with local authorities and there has been a significant increase in the number of Academies and free schools giving heads and teachers greater freedoms and flexibilities. The Government is clear that schools of all types should continue to maintain a strong relationship with local authorities over child protection and safeguarding concerns, although schools are able to determine the shape of that relationship. These changes, combined with changes in local authority structures and the introduction of Health and Wellbeing Boards (HWBs), mean research to understand and promote strong local collaborative safeguarding arrangements is timely and important.
In June 2010, the Secretary of State for Education requested an independent review of child protection in England from Professor Eileen Munro. As part of this work Professor Munro considered the wider organisational system in promoting or hindering good critical thinking. In order to be able to reflect the dynamic and unpredictable nature of child protection within a multi-agency context it is intended to use an approach that is capable of allowing this complexity to be examined and analysed.
The research will comprise three distinct but related phases: 1) Inception and scoping informed by: a) a literature review; b) discussions with representatives from key stakeholder groups; 2) A survey of all education and children&#x27;s social care sections of children&#x27;s service departments (or equivalents) in all local authorities; all LSCBs; all HWBs to: i) identify the relative contributions of predictive variables in successful multi-agency working; and ii) enable the selection of five case study authorities which represent a range of collaborative practice as identified through the survey, as well as different types of authority.
3) Five case studies: a) a short pro forma will be sent to all schools and Further Education colleges in the five case study authorities, to capture their experiences of involvement in safeguarding practice and to inform sampling of ten educational establishments in each area (total 50) to reflect diversity of provision. b) in the 50 identified educational establishments, all relevant key personnel will be interviewed and also asked to complete the Organisational Social Context (OSC) measure, a validated measure developed in United States (US) but used in a small number of English authorities. c) the school data will be mapped onto a framework developed by Professor Bob Hudson to assess capacity for collaborative practice and partnership, in this case of individual schools. d) discussion groups will be held with representatives from local authority agencies in the case study authorities and school staff to discuss the survey and interview data.
This research will provide information on the current arrangements existing between schools and the key bodies with responsibility for child protection and on how these arrangements are working. It will also contribute to what we know about decision-making around child protection by all the agencies concerned and make recommendations about the structures and support that best reflect the needs of the newly configured educational context."/><meta property="og:title" content="Supporting and Engaging Schools in Decision-Making and Multi-Agency Working for the Protection of Children, 2017-2019"/><meta property="og:description" content="To investigate the engagement of schools in decision-making and multi-agency working in relation to child protection four data sets were collected during three phases of the research.

multi-agency working in relation to child protection four data sets were collected during three phases of the research. The first data set is 17 transcripts taken from 'scoping' interviews with local authority education and children's social care staff. The findings of these interviews were used to inform the second phase of data collection involving national surveys of: (a) local authority education safeguarding leads; (b) children's social care leads; and (c) Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs). This is the second data set. The third phase of the project involved interviews with key staff involved in safeguarding and child protection work in 50 schools spread across 5 local authority areas. Staff were also asked to complete the Organisational Social Context questionnaire. The interview transcripts and questionnaire results from these case studies are included here as the third and forth data sets.Schools are an important source for the identification, referral and management of child protection concerns. Yet schools often lack robust arrangements for working in partnership with children's social care departments and/or find it difficult to implement these effectively (Baginsky, 2007; Ward, Brown \u0026 Maskell-Graham, 2012). A recent major review identified a lack of engagement by schools with safeguarding, despite the statutory framework to promote inter-agency co-operation (Davies and Ward, 2012). Furthermore, in recent years state-funded schools have been able to sever their links with local authorities and there has been a significant increase in the number of Academies and free schools giving heads and teachers greater freedoms and flexibilities. The Government is clear that schools of all types should continue to maintain a strong relationship with local authorities over child protection and safeguarding concerns, although schools are able to determine the shape of that relationship. These changes, combined with changes in local authority structures and the introduction of Health and Wellbeing Boards (HWBs), mean research to understand and promote strong local collaborative safeguarding arrangements is timely and important.\\nIn June 2010, the Secretary of State for Education requested an independent review of child protection in England from Professor Eileen Munro. As part of this work Professor Munro considered the wider organisational system in promoting or hindering good critical thinking. In order to be able to reflect the dynamic and unpredictable nature of child protection within a multi-agency context it is intended to use an approach that is capable of allowing this complexity to be examined and analysed.\\nThe research will comprise three distinct but related phases: 1) Inception and scoping informed by: a) a literature review; b) discussions with representatives from key stakeholder groups; 2) A survey of all education and children's social care sections of children's service departments (or equivalents) in all local authorities; all LSCBs; all HWBs to: i) identify the relative contributions of predictive variables in successful multi-agency working; and ii) enable the selection of five case study authorities which represent a range of collaborative practice as identified through the survey, as well as different types of authority.\\n3) Five case studies: a) a short pro forma will be sent to all schools and Further Education colleges in the five case study authorities, to capture their experiences of involvement in safeguarding practice and to inform sampling of ten educational establishments in each area (total 50) to reflect diversity of provision. b) in the 50 identified educational establishments, all relevant key personnel will be interviewed and also asked to complete the Organisational Social Context (OSC) measure, a validated measure developed in United States (US) but used in a small number of English authorities. c) the school data will be mapped onto a framework developed by Professor Bob Hudson to assess capacity for collaborative practice and partnership, in this case of individual schools. d) discussion groups will be held with representatives from local authority agencies in the case study authorities and school staff to discuss the survey and interview data.\\nThis research will provide information on the current arrangements existing between schools and the key bodies with responsibility for child protection and on how these arrangements are working.
