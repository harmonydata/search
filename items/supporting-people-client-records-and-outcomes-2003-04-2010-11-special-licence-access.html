The data provide information about the routes by which Supporting People services were accessed, the personal characteristics of service users, and outcomes for clients matched against their identified needs. Client Records data were collected from the start of the Supporting People programme; the information formed part of the framework for assessing service quality and gathering management information, providing valuable data for service providers, local authorities and central government. The data covered client characteristics for the 21 different client groups who received Supporting People services.  Outcomes data were collected for short-term Supporting People services (28 days or more, but less than two years) from 31 May 2007. In addition, Outcomes data for long-term Supporting People services (over two years) was collected from July 2007. The Outcomes Framework was based on the Department for Education and Skills&#x27; (DfES) &#x27;Every Child Matters&#x27; framework which captures five high level outcomes, relating to economic well-being, enjoying and achieving (e.g. participating in training or education activities), being healthy, staying safe, and making a positive contribution. Information was also gathered on further underlying indicators. Data were collected by providers of Supporting People services. Completion was not mandatory, although a number of local authorities made it a condition of their contract with providers to submit this information. No estimates were made for missing returns.

In April 2011, the Department ceased collection of Supporting People Client Record and Outcome data, when the Supporting People programme funding rolled into Formula Grant (the blanket term given to the main sources of general Government funding for English local authorities. For further information, see the DCLG&#x27;s Supporting People webpages.

End User Licence and Special Licence datasets
A more detailed version of the Supporting People Client Records and Outcomes dataset, containing finer-level geographic data and information on service providers, is available under SN 7020. However, users should note that it is subject to restrictive Special Licence Access conditions and is available to UK users only with the depositor&#x27;s permission. If the End User Licence (EUL) version (SN 7005) is sufficient for analysis, it is recommended that version is used, as it is available to all registered users under standard access conditions."/><meta property="og:title" content="Supporting People Client Records and Outcomes, 2003/04-2010/11: Special Licence Access"/><meta property="og:description" content="The Supporting People Client Records and Outcomes dataset comprises information about clients who entered and left housing support services that were in receipt of funding from the Department of Communities and Local Government&#x27;s (DCLG) &#x27;Supporting People&#x27; programme, which ran from April 2003 to April 2011.

entered and left housing support services that were in receipt of funding from the Department of Communities and Local Government's (DCLG) 'Supporting People' programme, which ran from April 2003 to April 2011. The data provide information about the routes by which Supporting People services were accessed, the personal characteristics of service users, and outcomes for clients matched against their identified needs. Client Records data were collected from the start of the Supporting People programme; the information formed part of the framework for assessing service quality and gathering management information, providing valuable data for service providers, local authorities and central government. The data covered client characteristics for the 21 different client groups who received Supporting People services.  Outcomes data were collected for short-term Supporting People services (28 days or more, but less than two years) from 31 May 2007. In addition, Outcomes data for long-term Supporting People services (over two years) was collected from July 2007. The Outcomes Framework was based on the Department for Education and Skills' (DfES) 'Every Child Matters' framework which captures five high level outcomes, relating to economic well-being, enjoying and achieving (e.g. participating in training or education activities), being healthy, staying safe, and making a positive contribution. Information was also gathered on further underlying indicators. Data were collected by providers of Supporting People services. Completion was not mandatory, although a number of local authorities made it a condition of their contract with providers to submit this information.
