A more detailed version of the Supporting People Client Records and Outcomes dataset, containing finer-level geographic data and information on service providers, is available under SN 7020. However, users should note that it is subject to restrictive Special Licence Access conditions and is available to UK users only with the depositor's permission. If the End User Licence (EUL) version (SN 7005) is sufficient for analysis, it is recommended that version is used, as it is available to all registered users under standard access conditions.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Supporting People Client Records and Outcomes, 2003/04-2010/11: Special Licence Access"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Supporting People Client Records and Outcomes, 2003/04-2010/11: Special Licence Access"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/supporting-people-client-records-and-outcomes-2003-04-2010-11-special-licence-access"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Supporting People Client Records and Outcomes, 2003/04-2010/11: Special Licence Access"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Supporting People Client Records and Outcomes, 2003/04-2010/11: Special Licence Access"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
