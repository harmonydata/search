In addition, a new 'Housing Possession Mediation Pilot Scheme', intended to run for six months, began on 1 February 2021. These initiatives are designed to increase opportunities for the parties to reach agreement and avoid the need for a substantive court hearing, thereby reducing the number of evictions and relieving pressure on the already overburdened court system.

The findings of this project will contribute new knowledge to a range of academic disciplines including law, business, economics, and psychology. By working closely with key stakeholders, including housing providers, legal practitioners and the Ministry of Justice, it will also give rise to knowledge exchange and impact. It will, in particular, inform urgent policy decisions regarding both the current and future development of the eviction process and thereby assist some households in their attempts to avoid losing their home.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Survey Data on Housing Possession Cases During the COVID-19 Pandemic, 2021"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Survey Data on Housing Possession Cases During the COVID-19 Pandemic, 2021"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/survey-data-on-housing-possession-cases-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-2021"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Survey Data on Housing Possession Cases During the COVID-19 Pandemic, 2021"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Survey Data on Housing Possession Cases During the COVID-19 Pandemic, 2021"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
