The demographics of the poor are starkly socially marked.

2) analytical development in the study of poverty and its persistence which, informed by recent statistical research and policy shifts at the national and state levels, crafts a more critical and powerful alternative to poverty measurements by ethnographically exploring the relationship between political and economic transformations in rural-based dalit and adivasi lives, and the transformations taking place at the macro level. Crucially this involves analytically establishing a research field which structures ethnography in the framework of political economic theory and brings this combination to the centre of understandings of poverty. 
3) some of the first historically situated ethnographic studies which are comparative, not only in their regional distribution, but also in their underlying theoretical and methodological bases. The three cases - from central and eastern India - will be integrated at the level of planning, midterm goals and findings. Methodologically, the project will thus establish the value of an underdeveloped systematic ethnographic approach to poverty which will foreground the comparison of the consequences of rural political and economic transformation on dalit and adivasi lives across a number of different scales and settings in the most under-researched parts of the subcontinent.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Survey of caste, occupation and education in five localities in India 2014-2015"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Survey of caste, occupation and education in five localities in India 2014-2015"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/survey-of-caste-occupation-and-education-in-five-localities-in-india-2014-2015"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Survey of caste, occupation and education in five localities in India 2014-2015"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Survey of caste, occupation and education in five localities in India 2014-2015"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
