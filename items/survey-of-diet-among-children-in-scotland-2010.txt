in addition, the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) collected information on the child's diet over the past 2-3 months, and foods usually eaten. There were two versions of the FFQ: one for children aged 3-11 years and the other for children aged 12-16 years. A parent or guardian was asked to complete the FFQ and the interview on behalf of younger group with help from the child where appropriate. The older group were asked to complete the FFQ and the questions in the interview relating to physical activity and food purchasing behaviour with help from a parent or guardian as necessary. Nutrient intakes were subsequently calculated from the FFQs using an in-house calculation programme, developed by the University of Aberdeen.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Survey of Diet among Children in Scotland, 2010"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Survey of Diet among Children in Scotland, 2010"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/survey-of-diet-among-children-in-scotland-2010"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Survey of Diet among Children in Scotland, 2010"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Survey of Diet among Children in Scotland, 2010"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
