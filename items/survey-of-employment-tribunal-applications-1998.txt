Unfortunately several problems with the CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing) script programming meant that the data quality standards fall short of what might be hoped for such in such an important study.  The very degree of complexity involved in the proposed survey design and methodology, combined with numerous failures in the routing systems, has resulted in the collection of data in certain cases that are inappropriate and also the non-collection of data in cases where it would be appropriate.

Users are advised to read the supporting documentation very carefully before using these data.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Survey of Employment Tribunal Applications, 1998"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Survey of Employment Tribunal Applications, 1998"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/survey-of-employment-tribunal-applications-1998"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Survey of Employment Tribunal Applications, 1998"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Survey of Employment Tribunal Applications, 1998"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
