Unfortunately several problems with the programming of the computer assisted telephone interviewing software (Blaise) used to collect the data has meant that information is not always of a quality which might be hoped for in such a study.  In general however, these problems relate to a small number of variables and cases.  Information on the caveats can be found in the supporting documentation.   Users are advised to read the documentation very carefully before using these data.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Survey of Representatives, 1998 / SOR98; \r\nSETA98 Survey of Representatives"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Survey of Representatives, 1998 / SOR98; \r\nSETA98 Survey of Representatives"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/survey-of-representatives-1998-sor98-seta98-survey-of-representatives"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Survey of Representatives, 1998 / SOR98; \r\nSETA98 Survey of Representatives"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Survey of Representatives, 1998 / SOR98; \r\nSETA98 Survey of Representatives"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
