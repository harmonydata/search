Standard measures of resident dependency were computed from the resident-level data: the Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living (Royal College of Physicians and British Geriatrics Society, Standardised Assessment Scales for Elderly People, Royal College of Physicians of London, London, 1992); and the Minimum Data Set Cognitive Performance Scale (Morris, J.N., Fries, B.E., Mehr, D.R., Hawes, C., Phillips, C., Mor, V. and Lipsitz, L.A., MDS Cognitive Performance Scale, Journal of Gerontology: Medical Sciences, 1994, 49(4), M174-M182).

The measure of social care outcome for older people (SCOOP) developed by Netten and her colleagues was computed from the Family/Friend Questionnaire data (Netten, A., Ryan, M., Smith, P., Skatun, D., Healey, A., Knapp, M. and Wykes, T., The Development of a Measure of Social Care Outcome for Older People, PSSRU Discussion Paper No. 1690/2, Personal Social Services Research Unit, 2002). (Note that the final version of the measure is the Older People's Utility Scale for Social Care (OPUS).)

Wenger's Support Network Typology (Wenger, G.C., Help in Old Age – Facing up to Change: A Longitudinal Network Study, Institute of Human Ageing, Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, 1992) was used to classify the informal care network of residents using Wenger and Scott's Support Network Type Algorithm version 1.2 ((c) G.
