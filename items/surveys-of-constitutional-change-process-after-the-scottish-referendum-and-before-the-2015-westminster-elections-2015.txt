Subsequently we will do the reverse and present elites, in further interviews, with the findings from the survey to explicitly investigate their responses to differences and similarities between their own attitudes and those of the public. 
The survey is designed in such a way as to ensure sufficient data to compare attitudes across the UK. This will allow distinctions to be drawn among attitudes in Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland and the different regions of England. Doing so will allow us to point out how political attitudes in particular areas may differ from others, and also how they may have a different emphasis to the dominant framing of the issue in elite discourse. 
We will include a larger sample of 16-17-year-olds to investigate their political attitudes to contribute to the debate on extending the voting franchise. Research in the context of the Scottish independence referendum has shown that young people were very interested to engage in politics after allowing them to vote. We will investigate whether the findings about young people's political interest and engagement can be replicated across the UK and prior to a general election rather than in a special situation such as a referendum. With this information we will be able to make a contribution to the debate about the lowering of the voting age, a move that Ed Miliband (Leader of the Labour Party) and the SNP (amongst others), have signalled their support for.18:T127a,Surveys of constitutional change process aims to investigate public's attitudes and awareness toward constitutional preferences, constitutional change process and civic culture orientations between the Scottish referendum and the 2015 Westminster elections.These statistics were used to help understand public attitudes and the similarities/differences with elite attitudes.

The sampling design ensures sufficient numbers of participants in different regions across the UK. The survey asked people who live in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, their views on specific possible political changes in their areas. In addition to this, young people aged 16-17 years old were over-sampled to investigate the questions around the extension of voting franchise to young people.The UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, has announced that there will be a rapid transfer of powers to the Scottish Parliament and fundamental changes to the operation of Westminster. Cameron's establishing of the Smith Commission to consider the former, and tasking William Hague (Leader of the Commons) to consider the latter, were triggered by Scotland's independence referendum. Specifically they build on commitments made by the leaders of the three parties opposed to independence in the closing days of that campaign. Current plans include the UK Government's publication of a Command Paper (published on 13 October) and of draft legislation by 25 January 2015, as well as a possible vote in the House of Commons on the issue of "English votes for English laws" by the end of December.
The timetable is tight. Developments are also taking place in a context where public awareness of constitutional issues has been heightened by the referendum debates. The proposed research would help to ensure both that the process is empirically informed and that public attitudes to these issues are accurately captured and reported.
The research will involve two coordinated sets of data collection. The first entails elite interviews with political decision makers, civil servants and campaigners who shape public debate, establishing their aims for constitutional change. The second entails a representative survey of c.7500 respondents - through an online panel - to establish what the key concerns of the public are with respect to constitutional change. 
By combining the two research strands we will identify key differences and similarities between elite and public attitudes. The research will be crucial in helping to overcome the tendency of rapid political processes to be driven by elite decision makers with little space for public engagement. Our research will therefore be used to inform the debate several months in advance of the 2015 Westminster election and to influence the public and media discourse with empirical facts about divergences and similarities between elite framing of the issue of constitutional change and the issues that most people consider important. 
In order to compare elite and public attitudes robustly we will first conduct initial elite interviews to identify dominant ideas on constitutional change amongst such actors. These will be used to formulate questions in the mass survey, ensuring that survey respondents will engage with the views of elite interviewees. Subsequently we will do the reverse and present elites, in further interviews, with the findings from the survey to explicitly investigate their responses to differences and similarities between their own attitudes and those of the public.
