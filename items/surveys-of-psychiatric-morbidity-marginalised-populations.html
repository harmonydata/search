of Psychiatric Morbidity - marginalised populations\",\"description\":\"The Surveys of Psychiatric Morbidity aim to provide information about the prevalence of psychiatric problems among people in Great Britain, as well as their associated social disabilities and use of services. The surveys covering adults in private households (undertaken in 1993, 2000, 2007 and 2014) and children and adolescents (1999, 2004 and 2017), are detailed elsewhere on the Catalogue. The  surveys detailed on this page were designed to show the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in a series of marginalised populations: adults in institutions specifically catering for people with mental illness (1994); homeless people (1994); prisoners (1997); and children and young people looked after by local authorities (2001/2). These surveys provide key context for understanding mental illness in Britain and for informing initiatives in this area.\",\"image\":\"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/APMS_other.png\",\"publisher\":{\"name\":\"NHS Digital, NatCen Social Research \u0026 Office of National

populations in Great Britain were conducted to assess the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among groups often overlooked in general population surveys. These specific surveys targeted adults in mental health institutions (1994), homeless individuals (1994), prisoners (1997), and children and young people under local authority care (2001/2). The methodology typically involved structured interviews and standardized diagnostic tools to evaluate mental health conditions and associated social challenges. Key findings highlighted higher rates of psychiatric disorders in these populations compared to the general public, underscoring the need for tailored mental health services and policy interventions. These surveys are significant as they provide critical insights into the mental health needs of marginalized groups, informing public health strategies and resource allocation to better support these vulnerable populations.\"}}]]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"Surveys of Psychiatric Morbidity - marginalised populations\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"The Surveys of Psychiatric Morbidity aim to provide information about the prevalence of psychiatric problems among people in Great Britain, as well as their associated social disabilities and use of services.
