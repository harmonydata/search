The project aimed to improve the capability of researchers to conduct socio-economic analysis in the buffer zone of the Cordilliera Azul National Park in Peru. This is a designated ‘protected area’ of rainforest, defined around a natural valley at the Western edge of the Amazon rainforest, and thus containing high and unique natural biodiversity. The Western edge of the park is a forest-frontier buffer zone, with a population of around 250,000, crossing a number of different local authority areas , with a number of towns and connected by all-season roads. The Eastern edge of the park has various indigenous areas in the vicinity, and is largely continuous forest to the border of Brazil and beyond. 
Rising levels of deforestation within the buffer zone prompt a need to better consider the nexus of conservation, livelihoods (well-being) and trade (in timber and agricultural commodities). 
This data set has been assembled as an index of relevant secondary data sources from across different government departments in order to help researchers explore this nexus. 

The index includes: 27 sets of agricultural data, 4 sets of livelihood data incl. census data and locations of indigenous groups, and 3 sets of deforestation data, plus geodata for the four local authorities bordering the park: Huanuco, Loreto, San Martín, Ucayali.This project supports sustainable economic development and welfare in farming communities in the Western edge of the Peruvian Amazon, by assisting a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Peru called CIMA (Centro de Conservación, Investigación y Manejo de Areas Naturales) to analyse and manage its socio-economic and geospatial data. Through analysis of extensive secondary data on farmer households and agricultural supply chains, alongside geospatial data providing evidence of patterns of deforestation in the landscape, the project aims to gain a better understanding of current practices, challenges, and opportunities for improving agricultural sustainability in the region. It will examine the data needed to inform and monitor the levels of sustainable rural livelihoods and forest conservation in the landscape, and seek to understand how sustainable agriculture (e.g. Fair Trade and organic certifications; agroforestry schemes) can be incentivised and promoted. Importantly, the project will develop standardised processes for data analysis to help support CIMA&#x27;s objectives for improving the quality of life of local communities while conserving forests.

As CIMA is required to report on how its conservation work benefits local people, the project will support the development of a data management approach that is based on community needs and wants, and helps to develop a holistic approach to understanding the links between livelihoods, supply chains, and deforestation. The proposed project will involve collection, cleaning and consolidation of the NGO-held data, and develop a platform on which the data can be stored and easily accessed by CIMA in the long-term. This will support the NGO in project monitoring and evaluation duties, and reporting to funding agencies, impact investors and against policy frameworks such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. Following the principles of mutual learning and transparency, all data and analysis will be shared by all members of the project team, and regular online meetings will be held between the research team and CIMA, to ensure that the data platform is developed with the input of users and to ensure that the project meets CIMA&#x27;s needs. The project is based on a strong relationship between the research team and the local partners, CIMA, who have successfully worked together on a preliminary ESRC IAA fund.

The research term at the University of Sussex will organise a series of three participatory workshops (project inception; capacity building; outputs and impact workshops) in Peru, with the project&#x27;s beneficiaries and stakeholders, including local and national government agencies. This will help to ensure that the project is supportive of Peru&#x27;s national vision for sustainable development and that the project can inform sub-national and national policy in Peru. Furthermore, the project has important implications for a large international community of practice (including business, civil society, funding agencies, governments) working on the intersection of forests, supply chains and local livelihoods; which demands a strong evidence base for action. The research team is interdisciplinary in nature, bringing together environmental scientists, human geographers, sustainable supply chain and performance indicator experts."/><meta property="og:title" content="Sustainable Livelihoods, Deforestation, and Supply Chains: Analysis of Environmental and Socio-economic Data from the Frontier of the Peruvian Amazon, 2019-2021"/><meta property="og:description" content="General aims, purposes and background of the collection.

background of the collection.\\nThe project aimed to improve the capability of researchers to conduct socio-economic analysis in the buffer zone of the Cordilliera Azul National Park in Peru. This is a designated ‘protected area’ of rainforest, defined around a natural valley at the Western edge of the Amazon rainforest, and thus containing high and unique natural biodiversity. The Western edge of the park is a forest-frontier buffer zone, with a population of around 250,000, crossing a number of different local authority areas , with a number of towns and connected by all-season roads. The Eastern edge of the park has various indigenous areas in the vicinity, and is largely continuous forest to the border of Brazil and beyond. \\nRising levels of deforestation within the buffer zone prompt a need to better consider the nexus of conservation, livelihoods (well-being) and trade (in timber and agricultural commodities). \\nThis data set has been assembled as an index of relevant secondary data sources from across different government departments in order to help researchers explore this nexus. \\n\\nThe index includes: 27 sets of agricultural data, 4 sets of livelihood data incl. census data and locations of indigenous groups, and 3 sets of deforestation data, plus geodata for the four local authorities bordering the park: Huanuco, Loreto, San Martín, Ucayali.This project supports sustainable economic development and welfare in farming communities in the Western edge of the Peruvian Amazon, by assisting a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Peru called CIMA (Centro de Conservación, Investigación y Manejo de Areas Naturales) to analyse and manage its socio-economic and geospatial data. Through analysis of extensive secondary data on farmer households and agricultural supply chains, alongside geospatial data providing evidence of patterns of deforestation in the landscape, the project aims to gain a better understanding of current practices, challenges, and opportunities for improving agricultural sustainability in the region. It will examine the data needed to inform and monitor the levels of sustainable rural livelihoods and forest conservation in the landscape, and seek to understand how sustainable agriculture (e.g. Fair Trade and organic certifications; agroforestry schemes) can be incentivised and promoted. Importantly, the project will develop standardised processes for data analysis to help support CIMA's objectives for improving the quality of life of local communities while conserving forests.\\n\\nAs CIMA is required to report on how its conservation work benefits local people, the project will support the development of a data management approach that is based on community needs and wants, and helps to develop a holistic approach to understanding the links between livelihoods, supply chains, and deforestation. The proposed project will involve collection, cleaning and consolidation of the NGO-held data, and develop a platform on which the data can be stored and easily accessed by CIMA in the long-term. This will support the NGO in project monitoring and evaluation duties, and reporting to funding agencies, impact investors and against policy frameworks such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. Following the principles of mutual learning and transparency, all data and analysis will be shared by all members of the project team, and regular online meetings will be held between the research team and CIMA, to ensure that the data platform is developed with the input of users and to ensure that the project meets CIMA's needs. The project is based on a strong relationship between the research team and the local partners, CIMA, who have successfully worked together on a preliminary ESRC IAA fund.\\n\\nThe research term at the University of Sussex will organise a series of three participatory workshops (project inception; capacity building; outputs and impact workshops) in Peru, with the project's beneficiaries and stakeholders, including local and national government agencies. This will help to ensure that the project is supportive of Peru's national vision for sustainable development and that the project can inform sub-national and national policy in Peru. Furthermore, the project has important implications for a large international community of practice (including business, civil society, funding agencies, governments) working on the intersection of forests, supply chains and local livelihoods; which demands a strong evidence base for action.
