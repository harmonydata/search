Research methods developed within the sociology of scientific knowledge will be used to explore the perspectives of environmental scientists. Public consultations will facilitate more effective communication between stakeholders – Chagossian groups, their lawyers, support organisations, environmental scientists, conservation groups, tourism companies, and representatives of the UK government – with the aim of developing a collaborative approach to resettlement.

This research will generate insights into collaborative natural resource management, processes of interdisciplinary collaboration, negotiation and dispute resolution, and knowledge practices in conflict.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Sustainable resettlement and environmental conservation: A collaborative approach to the right of return to the Chagos Archipelago"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Sustainable resettlement and environmental conservation: A collaborative approach to the right of return to the Chagos Archipelago"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/sustainable-resettlement-and-environmental-conservation-a-collaborative-approach-to-the-right-of-return-to-the-chagos-archipelago"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Sustainable resettlement and environmental conservation: A collaborative approach to the right of return to the Chagos Archipelago"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Sustainable resettlement and environmental conservation: A collaborative approach to the right of return to the Chagos Archipelago"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
