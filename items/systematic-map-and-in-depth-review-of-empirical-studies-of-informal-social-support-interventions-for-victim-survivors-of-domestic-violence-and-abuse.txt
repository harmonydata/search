In collaboration with stakeholders, these findings will then be translated into practical, real-world guidance for friends, families and communities, as well as DVA practitioners. The collaboration between UCL and SafeLives will ensure relevance, methodological rigour, and UK-wide reach of the project and outputs. SafeLives' #ReachIn campaign will serve as a vehicle for engaging key audiences and maximising benefits now, in the recovery phase of the pandemic, and beyond.28:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2c"}]
