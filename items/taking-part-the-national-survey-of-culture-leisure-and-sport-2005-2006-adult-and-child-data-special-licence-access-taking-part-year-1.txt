2d:Ta7c,The Taking Part survey collects data on many aspects of leisure, culture and sport in England, as well as an in-depth range of socio-demographic information on respondents. The survey is commissioned by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in partnership with three of its non-departmental public bodies (Sport England, Arts Council England and English Heritage). The survey was first commissioned in 2005 as a face-to-face household survey of adults (16+) in England. Since then it has run annually and has also been developed to include further elements, including a child element and a longitudinal element.

Further information can be found on the gov.uk Taking Part web pages.

Taking Part, 2005-2006, also known as Year 1 of the continuous survey, includes 28,117 interviews conducted with adults (aged 16 or over) and 2,918 interviews conducted with children (aged 11-15).

The survey used face-to-face computer assisted personal interviews, which take 45 minutes, on average, to complete. The sample for this survey has been randomly selected from the small-users postcode address file and only those from private households in England are included. No geographical restrictions are placed on the location of the engagement, although it must have been for the purpose of recreation or leisure, including voluntary work. Taking Part excludes involvement in sectors where the prime motivation is paid work or academic study. The exceptions to this are attendance at historic environment sites which included visits made for academic study and sports opportunities which excludes refereeing, officiating and coaching.

This study is subject to restrictive Special Licence (SL) access conditions as it contains additional detailed geographic variables (Local Authorities; ACORN Group; ACORN Category; ONS Urban Rural Classification). The End User Licence (EUL) version which is the same, but excludes these detailed variables, is available from the UK Data Service under SN 5717. Users are advised to first obtain the standard EUL version of the data to see if they are sufficient for their research requirements. The SL data have more restrictive access conditions; prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version.

 Main topics covered by the survey include: the arts, museums and galleries, libraries, archives, heritage, sport, social capital, engagement in various sectors whilst growing up, volunteering, broadcasting, gambling, the Olympics, licensing laws, and demographics.29:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2d"}]
