Taking Part excludes involvement in sectors where the prime motivation is paid work or academic study. The exceptions to this are attendance at historic environment sites which included visits made for academic study and sports opportunities which excludes refereeing, officiating and coaching.

For the second edition (September 2010), the child data and documentation were added to the study. In addition, the adult documentation has been updated and four variables have been removed from the adult data: area, key, sqmls and sqkms.

A Special Licence (SL) access version of this study is held under SN 7342, which contains additional detailed geographic variables (Local Authorities; ACORN Group; ACORN Category; ONS Urban Rural Classification). Users are advised to first obtain the standard EUL version (this study, SN 6273) to see if they are sufficient for their research requirements, as the SL data have more restrictive access conditions.

 Main topics covered by the survey include: the arts, museums and galleries, libraries, archives, heritage, sport, social capital, engagement in various sectors whilst growing up, volunteering, broadcasting, gambling, the Olympics, licensing laws, and demographics.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Taking Part: the National Survey of Culture, Leisure and Sport, 2007-2008; Adult and Child Data"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Taking Part: the National Survey of Culture, Leisure and Sport, 2007-2008; Adult and Child Data"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/taking-part-the-national-survey-of-culture-leisure-and-sport-2007-2008-adult-and-child-data"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Taking Part: the National Survey of Culture, Leisure and Sport, 2007-2008; Adult and Child Data"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Taking Part: the National Survey of Culture, Leisure and Sport, 2007-2008; Adult and Child Data"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
