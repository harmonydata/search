To make space for these new questions, several questions from the barriers section and all attitudinal questions that had been added at the start of 2010-2011, were removed. 

This study is subject to restrictive Special Licence (SL) access conditions as it contains additional detailed geographic variables (Local Authorities; ACORN Group; ACORN Category; ONS Urban Rural Classification). The End User Licence (EUL) version which is the same, but excludes these detailed variables, is available from the UK Data Service under SN 6855. Users are advised to first obtain the standard EUL version of the data to see if they are sufficient for their research requirements. The SL data have more restrictive access conditions; prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version.

 Main topics covered by the survey include: the arts, museums and galleries, libraries, archives, heritage, sport, social capital, volunteering, gambling, the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games, charitable donations, and demographics.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Taking Part: the National Survey of Culture, Leisure and Sport, 2010-2011; Adult and Child Data:  Special Licence Access / Taking Part Year 6"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Taking Part: the National Survey of Culture, Leisure and Sport, 2010-2011; Adult and Child Data:  Special Licence Access / Taking Part Year 6"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/taking-part-the-national-survey-of-culture-leisure-and-sport-2010-2011-adult-and-child-data-special-licence-access-taking-part-year-6"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Taking Part: the National Survey of Culture, Leisure and Sport, 2010-2011; Adult and Child Data:  Special Licence Access / Taking Part Year 6"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Taking Part: the National Survey of Culture, Leisure and Sport, 2010-2011; Adult and Child Data:  Special Licence Access / Taking Part Year 6"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
