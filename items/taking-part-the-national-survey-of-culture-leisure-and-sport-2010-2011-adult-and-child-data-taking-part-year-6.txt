2b:T8b3,The Taking Part survey collects data on many aspects of leisure, culture and sport in England, as well as an in-depth range of socio-demographic information on respondents. The survey is commissioned by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in partnership with three of its non-departmental public bodies (Sport England, Arts Council England and English Heritage). The survey was first commissioned in 2005 as a face-to-face household survey of adults (16+) in England. Since then it has run annually and has also been developed to include further elements, including a child element and a longitudinal element.

Further information can be found on the Gov.uk Taking Part web pages.

 For Taking Part, 2010-2011, also known as Year 6 of the continuous survey, 14,002 adults and 1,116 children aged 11-15 were interviewed. Information was also collected from parents or guardians of 1,590 children aged 5-10. Interviews were conducted face-to-face in home by specially trained interviewers working on behalf of TNS-BMRB using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).

Different questionnaires were used for fieldwork conducted in Quarters 1-3 to Quarter 4 of the 2010-2011 survey. In Quarter 4, new questions on charitable giving and competitive sport were added to the questionnaire to reflect the new Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) policy priorities. To make space for these new questions, several questions from the barriers section and all attitudinal questions that had been added at the start of 2010-2011, were removed. 

A Special Licence (SL) access version of this study is held under SN 7345, which contains additional detailed geographic variables (Local Authorities; ACORN Group; ACORN Category; ONS Urban Rural Classification). Users are advised to first obtain the standard EUL version (this study, SN 6855) to see if they are sufficient for their research requirements, as the SL data have more restrictive access conditions.

 Main topics covered by the survey include: the arts, museums and galleries, libraries, archives, heritage, sport, social capital, volunteering, gambling, the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games, charitable donations, and demographics.27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2b"}]
