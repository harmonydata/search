2d:T9cf,The Taking Part survey collects data on many aspects of leisure, culture and sport in England, as well as an in-depth range of socio-demographic information on respondents. The survey is commissioned by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in partnership with three of its non-departmental public bodies (Sport England, Arts Council England and English Heritage). The survey was first commissioned in 2005 as a face-to-face household survey of adults (16+) in England. Since then it has run annually and has also been developed to include further elements, including a child element and a longitudinal element.

Further information can be found on the gov.uk Taking Part web pages.

For Taking Part, 2018-2019, also known as Year 14 of the continuous survey, 8,161 adults and 645 children aged 11-15 were interviewed. Information was also collected from parents or guardians of 999 children aged 5-10. Interviews were conducted face-to-face in home by specially trained interviewers working on behalf of NatCen and Ipsos MORI using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). This study is subject to restrictive Special Licence (SL) access conditions as it contains additional detailed geographic variables (ACORN Group; ONS Urban-Rural Classification). The End User Licence (EUL) version which does not contain these detailed variables, is available under SN 8631. Users are advised to first obtain the standard EUL version of the data to see if they are sufficient for their research requirements. The SL data have more restrictive access conditions; prospective users of the SL version will need to complete an extra application form and demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the additional variables in order to get permission to use that version.Latest edition informationFor the third edition (January 2024), the data and documentation for the web panel have been added.

Main topics covered by the survey include: the arts, museums and galleries, libraries, archives, heritage, sport, volunteering, charitable giving, general free time activities, digital activities, special events (currently the First World War commemorations), community participation, personal well-being and demographics. Almost all of these topics appear in the main adult and child data sets, and in the longitudinal data sets. First World War and personal well-being are not covered in the child dataset (although children aged 11-15 are asked about their level of happiness).29:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2d"}]
