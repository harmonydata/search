For Taking Part, 2019-2020, also known as Year 15 of the continuous survey, 7,502 adults and 620 children aged 11-15 were interviewed. Information was also collected from parents or guardians of 834 children aged 5-10. Interviews were conducted face-to-face in-home by specially trained interviewers working on behalf of NatCen and Ipsos MORI using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).

In order to preserve confidentiality, variables relating to the census output area, postcode sector, local authority, and primary sampling units have been removed from the UK Data Archive End User Licence version. A Special Licence version that contains more detailed data, including detailed geographical variables (ACORN Group and ONS Urban-Rural Classification), is available under SN 8746.  In addition, a study titled Taking Part Web Panel Data: Engagement During the COVID-19 Pandemic, 2020 is available under SN 8744.Latest edition information
