In 1981, the population were 100% nomadic pastoralists, transhuming in and around the Inner Niger Delta and had an unusual demographic regime for a rural West African population.\n\nFrom 1991-95 a rebellion in northern Mali forced the majority of high status Tamasheq from this area to flee to refugee camps in Mauritania where some spent up to 5 years.  They were repatriated in 1996-97.  Many socio-economic and political changes along with the actual experience of being persecuted and forced to flee suggested that the whole process may also have had significant repercussions for demographic behaviour.  This study was undertaken to establish in what ways their demography has changed in the intervening twenty years and to examine the contribution of different factors to such change: for example, changing household economy, sedentarisation, disappearance of servile labour force, access to health and education services in the refugee camps, changing political awareness, and changing relationships with other ethnic groups in their areas of origin.\n\nBoth quantitative and qualitative data were collected. A single round demographic survey in 2001 â€“ largely covering the same population as in 1981 - provides the base-line quantitative data for analysis of demographic change. An anthropological study, undertaken over 18 months focused on four communities (two nomadic, two sedentary) and peoples' experiences of the rebellion and repatriation period.  This component included participant observation, in-depth interviews, life histories and a multi-round survey of 67 households over a year focusing on economic organisation and well-being, livelihood strategies, migrations and movements. These multi-round households included nomadic and sedentary, refugee and non-refugee, high status and low status.\n\nThe quantitative data for this study are available as data files, but the interview material has been included in the background documentation.
