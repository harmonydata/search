The sheet named “Decimal” shows, instead, decimal equivalents rounded to 4 decimal places.  For example £1 7s 3¾d converts to £1.3656.  The period covered runs from 1826 to 1974 – from the general introduction of Imperial weights and measures to the abolition of fiars courts.
Each worksheet shows annual prices by crop (wheat, peas, potatoes etc) for a single county.  The only crop recorded as being priced at some point during the period of study in every county was oat meal .  In the majority of counties more than one price was recorded for barley, oats and wheat.  These prices reflected either different qualities of grain – generally ‘first’ and ‘second’ quality, and in the richer farming areas of the south east of Scotland  ‘first’, ‘second’ and ‘third’ quality – or different local varieties .
The Register generally adopted the Imperial system of weights and measures, but different measures were used for different crops and by different counties .  The Imperial Quarter, a unit of dry volume equal to 64 Imperial Gallons, was deployed extensively.  Being a unit of dry volume its weight varied between grains and across years reflecting both grain density and climatic conditions prevailing during a growing season.  The ‘Boll’ was also widely used being the primary unit of volume for barley, oats and wheat in some counties, but of weight (140 Imperial Pounds) for oat meal.  More straightforwardly the weights of some grains were expressed in Imperial Pounds (lb) or Hundredweights (cwt) .10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Teind Court Register of Fiars’ Prices: Scotland, 1826 – 1974"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Teind Court Register of Fiars’ Prices: Scotland, 1826 – 1974"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/teind-court-register-of-fiars-prices-scotland-1826-1974"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Teind Court Register of Fiars’ Prices: Scotland, 1826 – 1974"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Teind Court Register of Fiars’ Prices: Scotland, 1826 – 1974"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
