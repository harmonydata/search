The research examined a number of key lines of investigation: (1) The relationship between, on one hand, size and corporate configuration and, on the other, the ability of production companies to maximise the value of their IPRs and to achieve sustained economic success; (2) the conditions that govern creative decision-making and content in the television production industry and how these are affected by differing corporate configurations; (3) the role of changing digital distribution technologies in encouraging consolidation and strategies of horizontal, vertical and transnational expansion in the television production industry; (4) implications for public policy and regulation.
These lines of enquiry were rooted in the context of a sector where ownership of production companies has become increasingly concentrated in the hands of a diminishing number of consolidated transnational operators. The project examined the performance of 12-case study television production companies of varying ownership configurations over the period 2007-2017, a period of seismic changes in the UK production sector driven by technological innovations, policy interventions and the entry of powerful new commissioning entities to the market.This project is about crucial transformations in the structure of ownership of the UK television production industry characterized by increasing consolidation and the growing controlling presence of non-domestic parent groups and related socio-economic, strategic management and policy implications. It breaks new ground by, focusing specifically on TV production, investigating the relationship between, on the one hand, expansion, scale and differing sorts of corporate configurations (whether owned by a multinational parent company; vertically integrated or not) and, on the other, economic performance and capacity to engage in business strategies that sustain growth in a TV landscape increasingly characterised by globalisation and digital multi-platform distribution. 

Television production is an important sector of industry both for economic and cultural reasons. Two variables that strongly affect the success of production businesses are, first, the effective management and exploitation of IPRs and, second, scale of activities. Over the last decade, adjustments in UK public policy that enhanced the position of production companies vis-à-vis broadcasters on ownership of IPRs have substantially improved the position of producers and boosted their sales revenues. But, as organic growth has contributed to scale and greater commercial success, this has triggered a recent wave of takeovers of many of the UK&#x27;s leading independent producers, often by US media conglomerates. A central concern here is to build understanding of the challenges faced in nurturing the development of UK production companies that achieve scale but, at the same time, remain independent. 
A further concern is to investigate empirically how a re-structuring of ownership may affect content. Against a background of increased investment interest from multi-nationals in indigenous UK-based players, this project will extend knowledge and theory by interrogating the association between corporate configuration, creative decision-making and cultural content. 
Using key case studies, the scope of the investigation will cover:
- the role of changing digital distribution technologies in encouraging consolidation and strategies of horizontal, vertical and transnational expansion in the TV production industry;
- the relationship between, on one hand, size and corporate configuration and, on the other, the ability of production companies to maximise the value of their IPRs and to achieve sustained economic success; 
- the conditions that govern creative decision-making and content in the TV production industry and how these are affected by differing corporate configurations; 
- implications for public policy and regulation.

lines of investigation: (1) The relationship between, on one hand, size and corporate configuration and, on the other, the ability of production companies to maximise the value of their IPRs and to achieve sustained economic success; (2) the conditions that govern creative decision-making and content in the television production industry and how these are affected by differing corporate

industry; (4) implications for public policy and regulation.\\nThese lines of enquiry were rooted in the context of a sector where ownership of production companies has become increasingly concentrated in the hands of a diminishing number of consolidated transnational operators.

It breaks new ground by, focusing specifically on TV production, investigating the relationship between, on the one hand, expansion, scale and differing sorts of corporate configurations (whether owned by a multinational parent company; vertically integrated or not) and, on the other, economic performance and capacity to engage in business strategies that sustain growth in a TV landscape increasingly characterised by globalisation and digital multi-platform distribution. \\n\\nTelevision production is an important sector of industry both for economic and cultural reasons.
