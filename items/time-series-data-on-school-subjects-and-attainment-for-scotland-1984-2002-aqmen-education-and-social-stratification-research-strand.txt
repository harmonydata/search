2c:T8d8,The dataset comprises harmonised data containing information about subjects studied and attainment achieved (for each subject and overall) in upper-secondary education (S5/S6) by respondents of the Scottish Young People's Surveys/Scottish School Leavers’ Surveys (1984-2002 cohorts) who took part in the follow-up surveys when they were aged 18-19. The data for the 1984-1991 cohorts were collected as part of the Scottish Young People's Surveys (see SN 33227) conducted by the Centre for Educational Sociology based at the University of Edinburgh and the data for the 1996, 1998 and 2002 cohorts were provided by the Scottish Qualification Authority and subsequently linked to the Scottish School Leavers' Surveys (see SN 33266)conducted by the National Centre for Social Research and funded by the Scottish Executive.  

The Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Phase II is a Research Centre that aims to develop a dynamic and pioneering set of projects to improve our understanding of current social issues in the UK and provide policy makers and practitioners with the evidence to build a better future. Three principal cross-cutting research strands will exploit existing high-quality data resources: (1) Education and Social Stratification will focus on social class differences in entry to, progression in and attainment at tertiary education and how they affect individuals' labour market outcomes and their civic participation; (2) Crime and Victimisation will explore the dramatic change in crime rates in Scotland and other jurisdictions and examines the determinants and impact of criminal careers amongst populations of offenders; and (3) Urban Segmentation and Inequality which will create innovative new measures of social segmentation and combine these with cutting-edge longitudinal and sorting-model techniques to explore the causes of neighbourhood segmentation, household location choice and neighbourhood inequalities. Five additional projects will focus on the referendum on Scottish independence, location dynamics and ethnicity and exploiting existing datasets. The research will fed into training activities and knowledge exchange events aimed at boosting capacity in quantitative methods amongst the UK social science community.28:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2c"}]
