The GST framework is designed to be able to provide explanations for a variety of types of behaviours and criminal activities. A recent research paper by Blevins et al. (2010) outlined how to apply GST with three major prison theories that are often used to understand prisoner violent behaviours - the deprivation model, the importation model, and the coping model. 

Since Blevins et al.’s (2010) article was published prison researchers have tested this theory’s understanding of prison strains and behaviour. However, these research studies have predominantly been conducted in United States (U.S.) prisons using a quantitative approach. This research offers a unique perspective by testing this theory qualitatively and by focusing on an E&amp;W prison context. E&amp;W prison strains will differ substantially from the strains highlighted in U.S. prison studies due to cultural and structural differences. It is therefore necessary for this research to highlight the specific strains that affect E&amp;W prisoners’ violent behaviour. 

This research comprised interviews with 41 recently released prisoners housed in 11 Approved Premises. Through analysing the interview data, I identified three systemic strains that are contributing to prison violence. These systemic strains are as follows: the strain of blocked desired costly goods; the strain of prison staff attitudes, disrespect, lack of support and misuse of power; and the strain of a strict regime. Each systemic strain produces and increases the magnitude of various stressors inside prisons. These stressors create pressure on some prisoners to react violently to attract attention, to defend themselves, to remove anticipated risks or to gain emotional relief. In order to reduce violence in E&amp;W prisons these systemic strains need to be addressed.For my PhD research I sought to provide an understanding of, and provide solutions to, prison violence in England and Wales using a General Strain Theory Framework. In order to understand how violence manifests itself, this research identified what strains are being produced by the prison environment that are linked to prisoner violent coping behaviour. This research comprised semi-structured interviews with 41 recently released prisoners housed in 11 Approved Premises. Approved Premises are probation institutions designed to house high-risk recently released prisoners. The Approved Premises selected were situated in a variety of towns across Northern England. The interviews took place within the Approved Premises in a quiet room provided by staff members. The participants were asked a range of questions that were pre-designed in the form of a topic guide in order to capture the various strains in Modern English and Welsh prisons that are potentially causing violent prisoner behaviour. Furthermore, as this research utilised a semi-structured interview, probing questions were asked depending on the answers that were given in the interview.  

Overall, the interview collection process was successful. The data collection lasted less than 2 months. I was able to capture a wide range of insightful diverse data largely due to my designed topic guide. All the data was transcribed by the researcher. Once transcribed, the data was uploaded onto NVivo and was qualitatively analysed using thematic analysis. Once the sub-themes were created, I created by hand thematic maps in which I connected the sub-themes together in order to produce my main themes which I called systemic strains. After creating my main themes, I began writing up my three-chapter findings using the data-extracts to back up my arguments. I have now produced my 100,000-word thesis and have deposited it onto the WhiteRoseThesisOnline website."/><meta property="og:title" content="Transcript Qualitative Interview Data Collected From Approved Premises Residents, 2022."/><meta property="og:description" content="The aim of this thesis is to provide an understanding of, and solutions to, England and Wales (E&amp;W) prison violence using a General Strain Theory (GST) framework.

Qualitative Interview Data Collected From Approved Premises Residents, 2022.\",\"description\":\"The aim of this thesis is to provide an understanding of, and solutions to, England and Wales (E\u0026W) prison violence using a General Strain Theory (GST) framework. The GST framework is designed to be able to provide explanations for a variety of types of behaviours and criminal activities. A recent research paper by Blevins et al. (2010) outlined how to apply GST with three major prison theories that are often used to understand prisoner violent behaviours - the deprivation model, the importation model, and the coping model. \\n\\nSince Blevins et al.’s (2010) article was published prison researchers have tested this theory’s understanding of prison strains and behaviour. However, these research studies have predominantly been conducted in United States (U.S.) prisons using a quantitative approach. This research offers a unique perspective by testing this theory qualitatively and by focusing on an E\u0026W prison context. E\u0026W prison strains will differ substantially from the strains highlighted in U.S. prison studies due to cultural and structural differences. It is therefore necessary for this research to highlight the specific strains that affect E\u0026W prisoners’ violent behaviour. \\n\\nThis research comprised interviews with 41 recently released prisoners housed in 11 Approved Premises. Through analysing the interview data, I identified three systemic strains that are contributing to prison violence. These systemic strains are as follows: the strain of blocked desired costly goods; the strain of prison staff attitudes, disrespect, lack of support and misuse of power; and the strain of a strict regime. Each systemic strain produces and increases the magnitude of various stressors inside prisons. These stressors create pressure on some prisoners to react violently to attract attention, to defend themselves, to remove anticipated risks or to gain emotional relief. In order to reduce violence in E\u0026W prisons these systemic strains need to be addressed.For my PhD research I sought to provide an understanding of, and provide solutions to, prison violence in England and Wales using a General Strain Theory Framework. In order to understand how violence manifests itself, this research identified what strains are being produced by the prison environment that are linked to prisoner violent coping behaviour. This research comprised semi-structured interviews with 41 recently released prisoners housed in 11 Approved Premises. Approved Premises are probation institutions designed to house high-risk recently released prisoners. The Approved Premises selected were situated in a variety of towns across Northern England. The interviews took place within the Approved Premises in a quiet room provided by staff members. The participants were asked a range of questions that were pre-designed in the form of a topic guide in order to capture the various strains in Modern English and Welsh prisons that are potentially causing violent prisoner behaviour. Furthermore, as this research utilised a semi-structured interview, probing questions were asked depending on the answers that were given in the interview.  \\n\\nOverall, the interview collection process was successful. The data collection lasted less than 2 months. I was able to capture a wide range of insightful diverse data largely due to my designed topic guide. All the data was transcribed by the researcher. Once transcribed, the data was uploaded onto NVivo and was qualitatively analysed using thematic analysis. Once the sub-themes were created, I created by hand thematic maps in which I connected the sub-themes together in order to produce my main themes which I called systemic strains. After creating my main themes, I began writing up my three-chapter findings using the data-extracts to back up my arguments.
