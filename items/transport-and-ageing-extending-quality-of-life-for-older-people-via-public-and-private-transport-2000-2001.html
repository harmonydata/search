Specific objectives were:
to examine the attitudes and perceptions of older adults (baby boomers and older people) to continued driving in old age, the barriers to the use of public transportation, and the role of private and public transportation in quality of life in old age;
to determine the extent to which the transportation needs of elderly people are taken into consideration by age-based interest groups, pro-automobile lobby groups, health and social care organisations, car, train and bus manufacturers, local authorities and government; 
to produce guidelines for local authorities, government organisations and manufacturers of trains, buses and automobiles, on the transportation needs of older adults.

A multi-method approach was used in this project. The study was conducted in Paisley, rural Renfrewshire, and inner and outer London. The developmental studies consisted of focus groups and street surveys. A postal survey (5000 questionnaires mailed, with 1128 returned) and interviews utilising a quota sample (194 in Scotland and 109 in London) formed the main data source. Interviews were also conducted with a range of policy makers, implementers of transport policy, and manufacturers of transport. The data were primarily analysed quantitatively, though a basic qualitative analysis of the focus groups and open-ended questions in the main interviews provided some limited but rich information to conceptualise the data and to provide explanatory power. The interviews with transport policy makers, implementers, and manufacturers were analysed qualitatively. A summary of the qualitative information gathered has been provided.
 1. Postal survey
The postal survey generated information about quality of life, satisfaction with public transport, car ownership, driver status and the use of public transport.

2. Main interview study
Samples of middle-aged and older adults were interviewed in depth using semi-structured interview schedules. The interviews generated information on the perceived role of transport (private and public) in quality of life, on barriers to the use of public transport, and views about stopping driving.

3. Main interview study – qualitative data
The face-to-face interviews included a number of open questions, and the responses were entered into a spreadsheet. The information gathered represents the views of each respondent, taken directly from the notes recorded during each interview on the schedule/questionnaire."/><meta property="og:title" content="Transport and Ageing : Extending Quality of Life for Older People Via Public and Private Transport, 2000-2001"/><meta property="og:description" content="The aim of this project was to examine public and private transportation needs in relation to extending quality of life in old age.

Specific objectives were:\\nto examine the attitudes and perceptions of older adults (baby boomers and older people) to continued driving in old age, the barriers to the use of public transportation, and the role of private and public transportation in quality of life in old age;\\nto determine the extent to which the transportation needs of elderly people are taken into consideration by age-based interest groups, pro-automobile lobby groups, health and social care organisations, car, train and bus manufacturers, local authorities and government; \\nto produce guidelines for local authorities, government organisations and manufacturers of trains, buses and automobiles, on the transportation needs of older adults.\\n\\nA multi-method approach was used in this project. The study was conducted in Paisley, rural Renfrewshire, and inner and outer London. The developmental studies consisted of focus groups and street surveys.
