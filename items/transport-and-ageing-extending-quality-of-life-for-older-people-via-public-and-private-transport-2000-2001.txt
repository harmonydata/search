The face-to-face interviews included a number of open questions, and the responses were entered into a spreadsheet. The information gathered represents the views of each respondent, taken directly from the notes recorded during each interview on the schedule/questionnaire.28:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2c"}]
