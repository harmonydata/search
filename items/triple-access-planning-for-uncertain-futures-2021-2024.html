The project was centred upon the concept of &#x27;Triple Access Planning&#x27; - a vision-led, access-focused approach to planning that accommodates uncertainty and which is seen to be an onward evolution of so-called &#x27;Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning&#x27;. The project sought through a partnership of academics and practitioners to ultimately develop &#x27;Triple Access Planning for Uncertain Futures - A Handbook for Practitioners&#x27; which was published in March 2024 and made freely available in the public domain. Through the course of the project, transport planning practice and knowledge, views and practices concerning digital connectivity, accessibility, access for goods and uncertainty were explored as part of building up a more developed understanding of the concept and practice of Triple Access Planning. The project involved exclusively qualitative research. It revealed the appeal of Triple Access Planning (TAP) among practitioners alongside frustrations with traditional transport planning and also brought to light the challenges of TAP - as an innovation - diffusing into mainstream practice. Several papers have been published from the project involving researchers at UWE supported by the ESRC grant. Due to ethical constraints a data deposit waiver has been put in place by the UK Data Service.Conventional approaches to mobility planning, based on the forecast-led paradigm, have led to unrealised expectations concerning alleviating problems such as congestion and delivering economic, social and environmental outcomes. Evidence shows plans become rapidly obsolete and lack resilience with regard to future developments. This project aims to improve Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs), addressing both the movement of people and goods, through two significant new considerations:

(1) Triple Access Planning (TAP) - future sustainable urban accessibility can be achieved through the transport system (physical mobility), the land-use system (spatial proximity) and the telecommunications system (digital connectivity); together constituting a Triple Access System (TAS).

(2) Accommodating uncertainty - unpredictable change dynamics such as demographics, economic developments, locational choices, regulatory context, technological breakthroughs, travel demand, and stakeholder behaviour can be explicitly taken into account in the plan, in terms of development and implementation.

This research project is highly collaborative and involves seven case study cities in five countries. Through a methodological approach that sequentially addresses theory, practice, design and application, TAP for uncertain futures guidance will be developed and evolved that complements existing SUMP guidelines. The project will strengthen resilience and adaptiveness in SUMPs by advancing theory and translating it into accessible, state-of-the-art, practical guidance."/><meta property="og:title" content="Triple Access Planning for Uncertain Futures, 2021-2024"/><meta property="og:description" content="This project was funded under the JPI Urban Europe ENUAC call focused on urban accessibility and connectivity.

Access Planning for Uncertain Futures, 2021-2024\",\"description\":\"This project was funded under the JPI Urban Europe ENUAC call focused on urban accessibility and connectivity. The project was centred upon the concept of 'Triple Access Planning' - a vision-led, access-focused approach to planning that accommodates uncertainty and which is seen to be an onward evolution of so-called 'Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning'. The project sought through a partnership of academics and practitioners to ultimately develop 'Triple Access Planning for Uncertain Futures - A Handbook for Practitioners' which was published in March 2024 and made freely available in the public domain. Through the course of the project, transport planning practice and knowledge, views and practices concerning digital connectivity, accessibility, access for goods and uncertainty were explored as part of building up a more developed understanding of the concept and practice of Triple Access Planning. The project involved exclusively qualitative research. It revealed the appeal of Triple Access Planning (TAP) among practitioners alongside frustrations with traditional transport planning and also brought to light the challenges of TAP - as an innovation - diffusing into mainstream practice. Several papers have been published from the project involving researchers at UWE supported by the ESRC grant. Due to ethical constraints a data deposit waiver has been put in place by the UK Data Service.Conventional approaches to mobility planning, based on the forecast-led paradigm, have led to unrealised expectations concerning alleviating problems such as congestion and delivering economic, social and environmental outcomes. Evidence shows plans become rapidly obsolete and lack resilience with regard to future developments. This project aims to improve Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs), addressing both the movement of people and goods, through two significant new considerations:\\n\\n(1) Triple Access Planning (TAP) - future sustainable urban accessibility can be achieved through the transport system (physical mobility), the land-use system (spatial proximity) and the telecommunications system (digital connectivity); together constituting a Triple Access System (TAS).\\n\\n(2) Accommodating uncertainty - unpredictable change dynamics such as demographics, economic developments, locational choices, regulatory context, technological breakthroughs, travel demand, and stakeholder behaviour can be explicitly taken into account in the plan, in terms of development and implementation.\\n\\nThis research project is highly collaborative and involves seven case study cities in five countries. Through a methodological approach that sequentially addresses theory, practice, design and application, TAP for uncertain futures guidance will be developed and evolved that complements existing SUMP guidelines.
