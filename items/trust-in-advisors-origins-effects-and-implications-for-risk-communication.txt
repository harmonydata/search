The government assured people that it was safe to eat beef but later this behaviour was later linked to a brain disease that is always fatal. This reduced trust in the government as a source of advice about risk for many people. As a result, there appears to be a reluctance to take government advice on other matters.

Advice will be attributed to different sources, such as government departments and consumer organizations. Its quality will be under our control. We shall be able to measure actual trust in an advisor (in terms of the degree to which peoples own risk judgments depend on the risk estimate provided by that advisor) and stated trust in that advisor (in terms of a trust rating). We shall be able to determine how these measures depend on quality of previous advice from that source and on other variables, such as the degree to which judges perceive their values to be similar to those of the advisore:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Trust in advisors: Origins, effects, and implications for risk communication"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Trust in advisors: Origins, effects, and implications for risk communication"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/trust-in-advisors-origins-effects-and-implications-for-risk-communication"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Trust in advisors: Origins, effects, and implications for risk communication"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Trust in advisors: Origins, effects, and implications for risk communication"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
