EHR University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) is one of the largest NHS Trusts in England, providing direct acute services & specialist care across four hospital sites, with 2.2 million patient episodes per year, 2750 beds & 100 ITU beds. UHB runs a fully electronic healthcare record (EHR) (PICS; Birmingham Systems), a shared primary & secondary care record (Your Care Connected) & a patient portal “My Health”.

The Society for Acute Medicine (SAM) Benchmark Audit (SAMBA) is a national benchmark audit of acute medical care. The aim of SAMBA20 is to describe the severity of illness of acute medical patients presenting to Acute Medicine within UK hospitals, speed of assessment, pathway and progress seven days after admission and to provide a comparison for each participating unit with the national average (or ‘benchmark’). On average >150 hospitals take part in this audit per year.
SAMBA20 winter audit measured adherence to some of the standards for acute medical care. Acute Medical Units work 24-hours per day and 365 days a year. They are the single largest point of entry for acute hospital admissions and most patients are at their sickest within the first 24-hours of admission. 
This dataset includes
•	Total number of patients assessed by acute medicine across ED, AMU and Ambulatory Care. 
•	Medical and nursing levels 
•	Severity of illness 
•	Timeliness in processes of care 
•	Clinical outcomes 7 days after admission
