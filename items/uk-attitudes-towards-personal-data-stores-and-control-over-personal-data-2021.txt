We conducted online focus groups of lay usersâ€™ comprehension of personal data and privacy provided by personal data stores. We fed our analysis into Cufflinkâ€™s product design, thereby improving the product, and we developed an Ethical Impact Assessment toolkit to evaluate all apps that are based on citizen-level personal data storage principles.18:T100c,(1) To ascertain how the British public (adults) feel about personal data storage apps and services, and how in control over their personal data they feel, we conducted a UK-wide demographically representative national survey  (implemented by survey company, ICM Unlimited, across 15-18 January 2021, 2,065 respondents, online omnibus).

(2) To qualitatively assess UK adults' views on control over personal data, and perceptions of personal data storage apps and services, six two-hour focus groups (35 participants) were conducted in February 2021, split according to age (18-34 year olds in Groups A, D and E, and 65+ in Groups B, C and F). 

(3) To ascertain how the British public (adults) feel about being paid for supplying their biometric and emotion personal data in a controlled fashion via personal data storage apps and services, we conducted a UK-wide demographically representative national survey (implemented by survey company, Walnut Unlimited, across 29 Sep â€“ 1 Oct 2021, 2,070 respondents, online omnibus).Research from academia, industry and regulators finds that most citizens care about their privacy and want greater control over their personal data. However, even the digital cognoscenti struggle to understand how personal data is collected, used and recirculated. Data literacy approaches therefore do not solve the issue of privacy exploitation. The utility of legal approaches is also questionable as European General Data Protection Directive consent processes are problematic. In addition to rights frameworks and regulation, new solutions are needed. As part of a privacy toolkit, privacy-by-design may help to achieve greater data privacy by embedding privacy considerations into systems that process personal data. 

Funded by Innovate UK Smart Grants (TS/T019964/1, File reference: 106283) in collaboration with project partner, Cufflink, this projectâ€™s central research question is: What empirically generated ethical factors do citizen-level personal data storage services such as Cufflink need to build in their app to empower users to manage their own personal information? 

Citizen-level personal data storage services seek to empower users to manage and control their own personal information when linking this to other individuals and organisations. Our project partner, Cufflink is developing a personal data storage app that, uniquely does not require users to prove their identity, and that has a clear, iconography-driven explanation of terms and conditions. However, we do not yet understand the ethical principles by which these apps work, whether their revenue models raise other ethical and privacy externalities, and whether their design adequately reflects citizen concerns with control over their data. If they are a privacy solution that helps structure interaction between citizens and businesses, what features are needed to ensure that everyday citizens, and not just the digital cognoscenti, use it?

To answer these questions, we have collaborated with Cufflink to understand the perceptual, behavioural and ethical contexts in which their product will be used. We have studied the affordances of early iterations of Cufflinkâ€™s app and key established competitor apps, and we undertook scoping interviews with relevant governance actors to discuss issues raised by citizen-level personal data storage apps. We conducted 2 demographically representative national surveys: survey 1 establishes UK-level attitudes towards the level of control that people feel they have over personal data, and towards personal data stores; survey 2 establishes UK-level attitudes towards being paid for supplying their biometric and emotion personal data in a controlled fashion via personal data storage apps. We conducted online focus groups of lay usersâ€™ comprehension of personal data and privacy provided by personal data stores. We fed our analysis into Cufflinkâ€™s product design, thereby improving the product, and we developed an Ethical Impact Assessment toolkit to evaluate all apps that are based on citizen-level personal data storage principles.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"UK Attitudes Towards Personal Data Stores and Control Over Personal Data, 2021"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"UK Attitudes Towards Personal Data Stores and Control Over Personal Data, 2021"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/uk-attitudes-towards-personal-data-stores-and-control-over-personal-data-2021"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"UK Attitudes Towards Personal Data Stores and Control Over Personal Data, 2021"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"UK Attitudes Towards Personal Data Stores and Control Over Personal Data, 2021"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
