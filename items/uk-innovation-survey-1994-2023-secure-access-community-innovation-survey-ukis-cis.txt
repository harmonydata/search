2d:Tcfe,The UK Innovation Survey (UKIS) provides the main source of information on business innovation in the UK. The survey data is a major resource for research into the nature and functioning of the innovation system and for policy formation. It is used widely across government, regions and by the research community. The UKIS also represents the UK's contribution to the Europe-wide Community Innovation Survey (CIS). Like many innovation surveys across Europe, the UKIS follows general guidelines set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) publication known as the Oslo Manual (OECD 2005). This manual provides guidelines on the conduct of innovation surveys, including statistical procedures and a review of the range of concepts that fall together under the umbrella term "innovation".

Geographical references: postcodes
The postcodes included in the first edition of these data (i.e. data files prior to 2008-2010) are pseudo-anonymised postcodes.  The real postcodes were not available due to the potential risk of identification of the observations.  However, these replacement postcodes retain the inherent nested characteristics of real postcodes. In the dataset, the variable of the replacement postcode is 'new_PC'.

The first two editions only include the first half of an observation's anonymised (or real) postcode (sometimes referred to as the outward code).  Researchers who are interested in analysing data by more disaggregated geographies (e.g. ward, output area) are advised that this is not possible using the first half of the postcode. Full, real postcodes are available from the third edition onwards, with the exception of .UKIS12, for which only the first half of the postcodes (outward codes) are available.For Secure Lab projects applying for access to this study as well as to SN 6697 Business Structure Database and/or SN 7683 Business Structure Database Longitudinal, only postcode-free versions of the data will be made available.

Linking to other business studies
These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) reference numbers.  These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations.  Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together.  Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research.
Latest edition informationFor the ninth edition (September 2024) data and documentation for UKIS 2023 (also known as UKIS 13), covering the period 2020 to 2022, were added to the study.
