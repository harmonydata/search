Due to available sample frames for recruitment, 65% of responses received were from the UKRI grant-holder list and a further 18% were from Innovate UK’s list of applicants. Analysis of survey data suggests UKRI grant recipients are more likely than the overall group of respondents to work in Higher Education and have other characteristics associated with this including being employed by an organisation or institution, having higher levels of qualifications, and conducting basic or applied research. Other differences are relatively small, apart from outputs: UKRI grant recipients are more likely to report that they have produced outputs including academic and other publications, datasets and databases and policy influence. This may reflect the criteria used to award grants.
