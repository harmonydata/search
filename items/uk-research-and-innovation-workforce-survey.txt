Please refer to the 2022 R&I Workforce Survey report and Technical report (in the Associated Media) for more information about eligibility.

Please note that the survey was UK-wide, but it is not UK-representative.
Fieldwork
7,519 eligible respondents completed the survey. To maximise completion rates, we aimed for the survey to take a maximum of 20 minutes to complete; the average time taken to complete it was 17 minutes.
Comparisons to the wider R&I workforce
This R&I workforce survey is representative of most occupations considered to be R&I, compared against the UK Labour Force. However, comparison with OECD UK R&D workforce composition data suggests the sample under-represented workers in private, for-profit organisations, and over-represented workers in other types of organisations.
We advise to weight the data to correct for this bias, giving more weight to workers responses in the private sector and less weight to workers responses in other types of organisations. Full details of our weighting approach and its effects are given in the technical report (Section 5 Weighting).
The survey seems to over-represent workers in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs; companies with less than 250 staff), particularly in the private sector (27% of all respondents and 48% of private-sector respondents worked in SMEs). 68% of the private sector workers covered in our survey worked in SMEs compared to 61% of the entire R&D workforce defined through relevant SOC codes applied to the Labour Force Survey (LFS) 2020.

Due to available sample frames for recruitment, 65% of responses received were from the UKRI grant-holder list and a further 18% were from Innovate UK’s list of applicants.

Fieldwork
7,519 eligible respondents completed the survey. To maximise completion rates, we aimed for the survey to take a maximum of 20 minutes to complete; the average time taken to complete it was 17 minutes.
Comparisons to the wider R&I workforce
This R&I workforce survey is representative of most occupations considered to be R&I, compared against the UK Labour Force. However, comparison with OECD UK R&D workforce composition data suggests the sample under-represented workers in private, for-profit organisations, and over-represented workers in other types of organisations.
We advise to weight the data to correct for this bias, giving more weight to workers responses in the private sector and less weight to workers responses in other types of organisations. Full details of our weighting approach and its effects are given in the technical report (Section 5 Weighting).
The survey seems to over-represent workers in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs; companies with less than 250 staff), particularly in the private sector (27% of all respondents and 48% of private-sector respondents worked in SMEs). 68% of the private sector workers covered in our survey worked in SMEs compared to 61% of the entire R&D workforce defined through relevant SOC codes applied to the Labour Force Survey (LFS) 2020.

Due to available sample frames for recruitment, 65% of responses received were from the UKRI grant-holder list and a further 18% were from Innovate UK’s list of applicants. Analysis of survey data suggests UKRI grant recipients are more likely than the overall group of respondents to work in Higher Education and have other characteristics associated with this including being employed by an organisation or institution, having higher levels of qualifications, and conducting basic or applied research. Other differences are relatively small, apart from outputs: UKRI grant recipients are more likely to report that they have produced outputs including academic and other publications, datasets and databases and policy influence. This may reflect the criteria used to award grants.
