Moreover, for environmental information in the UK, emphasis was placed on making data available on publicly accessible registers rather than simply entitling members of the public to make specific requests for information held by public authorities.

This project will evaluate the impact of access to environmental information by examining how the right of access is being used in practice and how far the objectives noted above are being satisfied. This will be achieved by examining the scale and nature of the use of the right, studying who is seeking information, what sort of information is being sought and what use is being made of it and gathering the experiences of those holding information, those using it and those affected by it. This will be achieved by gathering data on requests for information and on usage of the information which is proactively disseminated, through research with those holding and obtaining information, as well as with regulatory bodies affected by the deployment of the knowledge obtained. The project will focus on Scotland which provides a large, varied but manageable study area where the researchers have strong collaboration with the key public bodies and the expertise to put findings into the wider context of environmental debates, conflicts and policies.

This research will benefit those concerned with environmental matters and freedom of information. Members of the public (including politicians, the media and NGOs) will gain a better understanding of the actual and potential use of information rights and see examples of their effective use to influence and scrutinise government, on policy, procedure and substantive decisions. Public authorities holding environmental information will gain an awareness of how the right of access is being used, informing their procedures for handling requests and their policies on what information should be published pro-actively. Insight can be gained into easing the burdens of fulfilling the legal requirements and how the governance processes can be made more efficient and effective. For the Scottish Information Commissioner and others charged with oversight of public access to information, the understanding of who is seeking what information and using it in what ways will enable them to tailor their advice and support, for members of the public and public authorities, in order to benefit all concerned.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Uncovering the Environment: The Use of Public Access to Environmental Information, 2018-2019"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Uncovering the Environment: The Use of Public Access to Environmental Information, 2018-2019"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/uncovering-the-environment-the-use-of-public-access-to-environmental-information-2018-2019"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Uncovering the Environment: The Use of Public Access to Environmental Information, 2018-2019"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Uncovering the Environment: The Use of Public Access to Environmental Information, 2018-2019"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
