The research, conducted from March 2021 to August 2022, primarily aims to explore various facets of educational experiences, focusing on students, teachers, and educational volunteers in Solo, Indonesia.\n\nData was gathered through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, with an emphasis on deep interviews and surveys. The sampling procedure involved participants from Solo Mengajar, Kampus Mengajar, and the Department of Education in Solo. To ensure a holistic perspective, different instruments were utilized, including the Capabilities/Motivation Questionnaire Indonesia, Cantril Ladder (0-10), and specialized surveys like the ACES Teacher Survey: Frugal Aspects and ACES Student Survey: Playful Aspects.\n\nThe research investigates diverse dimensions such as teacher motivation, frugal aspects in the teacher's perspective, and playful aspects in students. Deep interviews, conducted with both experimental and control participants, reveal nuanced insights into STEM bucket reflection, teacher trainee perspectives, and reflections from informal teachers.\n\nStringent measures were taken to ensure data integrity and participant confidentiality. All identifying data were systematically removed, and the item descriptions were meticulously aligned with the instrument questions, affirming the precision of the collected data.\n\nThe findings from this study promise to contribute valuable insights into the motivations, capabilities, and reflections of educators and students alike. This multifaceted approach sheds light on the nuanced aspects of the educational landscape, offering a rich tapestry of information to inform educational policies, teacher training programs, and the enhancement of the overall teaching and learning experience.ACES will investigate and establish a transformative educational model for bridging formal and informal educational contexts via playful and participatory methodology towards a more inclusive, safe and resilient society that will empower young people to flourish despite their social localities. ACES will investigate the role of education in mobilising young people towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), taking into account the impact of wellbeing (SDG3), gender (SDG5) and poverty (SDG1) on education (SDG4) and vice-versa in Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam. ACES will focus on building resilient communities of young people in rural areas or deprived sections of urban communities through education. Young people refers to those in primary and secondary education. ACES will engage teachers and local community groups in the co-creation and ownership of the educational process, fostering an empowering and agentic practice when it comes to marginalised contexts - to motivate, ground and, most importantly, localise the intervention. The upskilling of teachers is considered as one of the most effective and direct means of achieving all of the SDG4 targets.\n\nThe effects of quality education are linked to improved development outcomes. In all three countries, access to inclusive and equitable quality education is an impending issue; however, the causes, scope and severity vary from one country to another. In Indonesia, the dominance of political, corporate and bureaucratic elites affects the provision of quality education. In Vietnam, its education system struggles to provide access and quality, although since 2008, its government allocates 20% of its national budget to improve education throughout the nation. In Malaysia, access to quality education is still an issue at remote/rural areas in the country. Even though these countries report the literacy rate of over 90%, the efforts to maintain sustainable growth in their respective economies, to reach developed status, hinge on an updated system of education that is more transformative beyond literacy. While economic growth in these countries brings positive benefits and lifts people out of poverty, societies must be equipped to respond to subsequent changes related to political and social systems. Economic resilience thus depends on social resilience, agency and capabilities to respond, design, implement and support corrective and adaptive measures. \n\nACES will explore the use of playful and participatory methodology towards developing an inclusive, equitable and transformative educational model that will afford opportunities for young people, teachers and community groups to respond to challenges/changes in their community through creative and innovative practices.","url":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/understanding-educational-dynamics-in-indonesia-a-multifaceted-inquiry-into-teaching-and-learning-processes-2021-2022","identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-856817"],"keywords":["RESILIENCE","CAPABILITIES","ACCESS TO EDUCATION","EDUCATION","TEACHER ATTITUDE","MOTIVATION","STUDENT ATTITUDE","VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS","LEARNING","LEARNING METHODS","PLAY"],"temporalCoverage":"2021-03-01/2022-08-22"}c:["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":[["$","$L18",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$19"}}],"$L1a"]}]

Deep interviews, conducted with both experimental and control participants, reveal nuanced insights into STEM bucket reflection, teacher trainee perspectives, and reflections from informal teachers.

Stringent measures were taken to ensure data integrity and participant confidentiality. All identifying data were systematically removed, and the item descriptions were meticulously aligned with the instrument questions, affirming the precision of the collected data.

The findings from this study promise to contribute valuable insights into the motivations, capabilities, and reflections of educators and students alike. This multifaceted approach sheds light on the nuanced aspects of the educational landscape, offering a rich tapestry of information to inform educational policies, teacher training programs, and the enhancement of the overall teaching and learning experience.ACES will investigate and establish a transformative educational model for bridging formal and informal educational contexts via playful and participatory methodology towards a more inclusive, safe and resilient society that will empower young people to flourish despite their social localities. ACES will investigate the role of education in mobilising young people towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), taking into account the impact of wellbeing (SDG3), gender (SDG5) and poverty (SDG1) on education (SDG4) and vice-versa in Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam. ACES will focus on building resilient communities of young people in rural areas or deprived sections of urban communities through education. Young people refers to those in primary and secondary education. ACES will engage teachers and local community groups in the co-creation and ownership of the educational process, fostering an empowering and agentic practice when it comes to marginalised contexts - to motivate, ground and, most importantly, localise the intervention. The upskilling of teachers is considered as one of the most effective and direct means of achieving all of the SDG4 targets.

The effects of quality education are linked to improved development outcomes. In all three countries, access to inclusive and equitable quality education is an impending issue; however, the causes, scope and severity vary from one country to another. In Indonesia, the dominance of political, corporate and bureaucratic elites affects the provision of quality education. In Vietnam, its education system struggles to provide access and quality, although since 2008, its government allocates 20% of its national budget to improve education throughout the nation. In Malaysia, access to quality education is still an issue at remote/rural areas in the country. Even though these countries report the literacy rate of over 90%, the efforts to maintain sustainable growth in their respective economies, to reach developed status, hinge on an updated system of education that is more transformative beyond literacy. While economic growth in these countries brings positive benefits and lifts people out of poverty, societies must be equipped to respond to subsequent changes related to political and social systems. Economic resilience thus depends on social resilience, agency and capabilities to respond, design, implement and support corrective and adaptive measures. 

ACES will explore the use of playful and participatory methodology towards developing an inclusive, equitable and transformative educational model that will afford opportunities for young people, teachers and community groups to respond to challenges/changes in their community through creative and innovative practices.1f:["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:description","content":"$2e"}]
