From April 2020, participants from this Study were asked to take part in the Understanding Society COVID-19 survey, henceforth referred to as the COVID-19 survey or the COVID-19 study.The COVID-19 survey regularly asked people about their situation and experiences. The resulting data gives a unique insight into the impact of the pandemic on individuals, families, and communities. The COVID-19 Teaching Dataset contains data from the main COVID-19 survey in a simplified form. It covers topics such as
Socio-demographics
Whether working at home and home-schooling
COVID symptoms
Health and well-being
Social contact and neighbourhood cohesion

The resource contains two data files:
Cross-sectional: contains data collected in Wave 4 in July 2020 (with some additional variables from other waves);
Longitudinal: Contains mainly data from Waves 1, 4 and 9 with key variables measured at three time points.
Key features of the dataset
Missing values: in the web survey, participants clicking &quot;Next&quot; but not answering a question were given further options such as &quot;Don&#x27;t know&quot; and &quot;Prefer not to say&quot;. Missing observations like these are recorded using negative values such as -1 for &quot;Don&#x27;t know&quot;. In many instances, users of the data will need to set these values as missing. The User Guide includes Stata and SPSS code for setting negative missing values to system missing.

The Longitudinal file is a balanced panel and is in wide format. A balanced panel means it only includes participants that took part in every wave. In wide format, each participant has one row of information, and each measurement of the same variable is a different variable.

Weights: both the cross-sectional and longitudinal files include survey weights that adjust the sample to represent the UK adult population. The cross-sectional weight (betaindin_xw) adjusts for unequal selection probabilities in the sample design and for non-response. The longitudinal weight (ci_betaindin_lw) adjusts for the sample design and also for the fact that not all those invited to participate in the survey, do participate in all waves.

Both the cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets include the survey design variables (psu and strata).
A full list of variables in both files can be found in the User Guide appendix.Who is in the sample?All adults (16 years old and over as of April 2020), in households who had participated in at least one of the last two waves of the main study Understanding Society, were invited to participate in this survey. From the September 2020 (Wave 5) survey onwards, only sample members who had completed at least one partial interview in any of the first four web surveys were invited to participate. From the November 2020 (Wave 6) survey onwards, those who had only completed the initial survey in April 2020 and none since, were no longer invited to participate
The User guide accompanying the data adds to the information here and includes a full variable list with details of measurement levels and links to the relevant questionnaire.

It captures important information every year about the social and economic circumstances, attitudes, behaviours and health of people living in thousands of UK households.\n\nInformation from the longitudinal survey is primarily used by academics, researchers and policy makers in their work, but the findings are of interest to a much wider group of people including those working in the third sector, health practitioners, business, the media and the general public.\n\nInterviews began in 2009 with eligible members of nearly 32,000 selected households invited to take part. Adults are interviewed and 10-15 year-olds fill in a paper self-completion questionnaire. New people join the study as they join the households of existing members, and if members leave their households, all adult members of their new household are interviewed. In 2010-11, some 20,000 participants aged over 16 also received nurse visits and provided a blood sample and some basic physical measurements (height, weight, blood pressure, grip strength). Data collection is annual, but each wave takes place over a two year period, with the second year of one wave overlapping the first year of the subsequent wave (so wave 1 took place between 2009 and 2011, wave 2 between 2010 and 2012, and so forth). \n\nA further 8,000 households from the British Household Panel Survey (see below) were invited to join at wave 2.\n\nAn additional 1,500 UK households are interviewed for the Innovation Panel, a separate annual survey which is used by researchers as a test bed for new ways of collecting data or exploring new topics before they become part of the main survey.\n\nUKHLS also has an ethnicity strand, with boost samples to ensure the study had at least 1,000 adults from the five main ethnicity groups in the UK. There are also extra questions asked each year of particular relevance to ethnic groups. In 2015, a further immigrant and ethnic boost sample was added to the study.\n\nStudy website: https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"18:[\"$\",\"$L19\",null,{\"study\":{\"dataset_schema\":{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Dataset\",\"name\":\"Understanding Society: COVID-19 Study Teaching Dataset, 2020-2021 / UKHLS\",\"description\":\"$1a\",\"url\":[\"https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=9019\"],\"keywords\":[\"Diet and nutrition\",\"Covid-19 data collection\",\"Biomarkers\",\"Cognitive measures\",\"Work and employment\",\"Social care -

From April 2020, participants from this Study were asked to take part in the Understanding Society COVID-19 survey, henceforth referred to as the COVID-19 survey or the COVID-19 study.The COVID-19 survey regularly asked people about their situation and experiences. The resulting data gives a unique insight into the impact of the pandemic on individuals, families, and communities. The COVID-19 Teaching Dataset contains data from the main COVID-19 survey in a simplified form. It covers topics such as\nSocio-demographics\nWhether working at home and home-schooling\nCOVID symptoms\nHealth and well-being\nSocial contact and neighbourhood cohesion\nVolunteering\nThe resource contains two data files:\nCross-sectional: contains data collected in Wave 4 in July 2020 (with some additional variables from other waves);\nLongitudinal: Contains mainly data from Waves 1, 4 and 9 with key variables measured at three time points.\nKey features of the dataset\nMissing values: in the web survey, participants clicking \"Next\" but not answering a question were given further options such as \"Don't know\" and \"Prefer not to say\". Missing observations like these are recorded using negative values such as -1 for \"Don't know\". In many instances, users of the data will need to set these values as missing. The User Guide includes Stata and SPSS code for setting negative missing values to system missing.\n\nThe Longitudinal file is a balanced panel and is in wide format. A balanced panel means it only includes participants that took part in every wave. In wide format, each participant has one row of information, and each measurement of the same variable is a different variable.\n\nWeights: both the cross-sectional and longitudinal files include survey weights that adjust the sample to represent the UK adult population. The cross-sectional weight (betaindin_xw) adjusts for unequal selection probabilities in the sample design and for non-response. The longitudinal weight (ci_betaindin_lw) adjusts for the sample design and also for the fact that not all those invited to participate in the survey, do participate in all waves.\n\nBoth the cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets include the survey design variables (psu and strata).\nA full list of variables in both files can be found in the User Guide appendix.Who is in the sample?All adults (16 years old and over as of April 2020), in households who had participated in at least one of the last two waves of the main study Understanding Society, were invited to participate in this survey.
