The Understanding Society Innovation Panel Life Events Study, 2020, was a monthly survey of households from the Innovation Panel sample. The aim of the study was to test methods for collecting data about life events (such as new health conditions, pregnancy, job changes, residential moves, and partnership changes) close in time to when the events occur. The survey asked about the occurrence of events, details of the events, and implications for wellbeing, mental health, finances, and support networks. The survey started in February 2020 and was fielded monthly until January 2021. The recall period for each survey was the previous calendar month, that is, the survey collected data about life events from January to December 2020. Innovation Panel sample members in households that regularly used the internet were invited to a monthly web survey. The data can be linked to data on the same individuals from previous and future waves of the annual Innovation Panel interviews (SN
