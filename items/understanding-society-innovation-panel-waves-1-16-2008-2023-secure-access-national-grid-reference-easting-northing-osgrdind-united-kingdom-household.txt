For details of the main Understanding Society study, please see study number 6614.Innovation PanelThe Innovation Panel is designed for experimental and methodological research relevant to longitudinal surveys. As far as practical its design, content, and data collection procedures are similar to the main stage Understanding Society survey. It is a multi-topic household survey representative of the population of Great Britain. Data collection takes place annually using computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), web surveys and telephone interviewing (CATI) to a small extent. One person completes the household questionnaire. Each person aged 16 or older answers the individual adult interview, including and self-completion questionnaire. Young people aged 10 to 15 years are asked to respond to a paper self-completion questionnaire. The Innovation Panel has multiple experimental studies in which households or individuals are randomly assigned to a particular instrument or survey procedure. Experiments can relate to survey procedures, questionnaire design, or substantive social science questions. The experiments are described in the User Manual and in Understanding Society Working Papers. Wave 12 included an experiment involving the collection of biomeasures by nurses, interviewers and respondents themselves. The biomeasures included in the experiment were: height, weight, blood pressure, venous and dried blood samples and hair samples. Biomarkers have been derived from the different blood and hair samples to compare analytes across sample types. Due to COVID-19 Waves 13 and 14 were implemented using computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) and web surveys. Wave 15 included additional data on body measurements. Respondents were asked to install the BodyVolume app on their smartphone or tablet (iOS or Android) and use it after the interview to take two photos of themselves. The app used the body outlines along with profile information that the respondent entered in the app (age, sex, height, weight, level of activity) to calculate measures including waist and hip circumference, total body fat, visceral body fat, and lengths of different body parts. Wave 16 included an experiment asking parents of children aged under 16 to supply health related information from the child’s red book. Respondents were also asked to install the Sea Hero Quest app and play a game that measures spatial cognition.Secure Access Dataset:The Understanding Society: Innovation Panel, Waves 1-16, 2008-2023 dataset contains British National Grid postcode grid references (at 1m resolution) for each household surveyed, derived from the ONS National Statistics Postcode Directories (NSPD). Grid references are presented in terms of Eastings and Northings, which are distances in metres (east and north, respectively) from the origin (0,0), which lies to the west of the Scilly Isles. Each grid reference is given a positional quality indicator to denote the accuracy of the grid reference. In the majority of cases, the assigned grid reference relates to the building of the matched address closest to the postcode mean. No grid references are provided for postcodes in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.The Secure Access version of Understanding Society: Innovation Panel 2008-2023 includes all files in the Special Licence version, plus files containing the 3 variables relating to the National Grid Reference for each household: Easting, Northing and positional quality indicator (OSGRDIND).

In wave 16 children were given the choice of completing the youth questionnaire online or in PAPI.18:T84c,Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) studies 21st century UK life and how it is changing. It captures important information every year about the social and economic circumstances, attitudes, behaviours and health of people living in thousands of UK households.

Information from the longitudinal survey is primarily used by academics, researchers and policy makers in their work, but the findings are of interest to a much wider group of people including those working in the third sector, health practitioners, business, the media and the general public.

Interviews began in 2009 with eligible members of nearly 32,000 selected households invited to take part. Adults are interviewed and 10-15 year-olds fill in a paper self-completion questionnaire. New people join the study as they join the households of existing members, and if members leave their households, all adult members of their new household are interviewed. In 2010-11, some 20,000 participants aged over 16 also received nurse visits and provided a blood sample and some basic physical measurements (height, weight, blood pressure, grip strength). Data collection is annual, but each wave takes place over a two year period, with the second year of one wave overlapping the first year of the subsequent wave (so wave 1 took place between 2009 and 2011, wave 2 between 2010 and 2012, and so forth). 

A further 8,000 households from the British Household Panel Survey (see below) were invited to join at wave 2.

An additional 1,500 UK households are interviewed for the Innovation Panel, a separate annual survey which is used by researchers as a test bed for new ways of collecting data or exploring new topics before they become part of the main survey.

UKHLS also has an ethnicity strand, with boost samples to ensure the study had at least 1,000 adults from the five main ethnicity groups in the UK. There are also extra questions asked each year of particular relevance to ethnic groups. In 2015, a further immigrant and ethnic boost sample was added to the study.

19:T1bb6,Understanding Society (UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, and the survey research organisations Verian Group and NatCen. It builds on and incorporates the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which began in 1991. For details of the main Understanding Society study, please see study number 6614.Innovation PanelThe Innovation Panel is designed for experimental and methodological research relevant to longitudinal surveys. As far as practical its design, content, and data collection procedures are similar to the main stage Understanding Society survey. It is a multi-topic household survey representative of the population of Great Britain. Data collection takes place annually using computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), web surveys and telephone interviewing (CATI) to a small extent. One person completes the household questionnaire. Each person aged 16 or older answers the individual adult interview, including and self-completion questionnaire. Young people aged 10 to 15 years are asked to respond to a paper self-completion questionnaire. The Innovation Panel has multiple experimental studies in which households or individuals are randomly assigned to a particular instrument or survey procedure. Experiments can relate to survey procedures, questionnaire design, or substantive social science questions. The experiments are described in the User Manual and in Understanding Society Working Papers. Wave 12 included an experiment involving the collection of biomeasures by nurses, interviewers and respondents themselves. The biomeasures included in the experiment were: height, weight, blood pressure, venous and dried blood samples and hair samples. Biomarkers have been derived from the different blood and hair samples to compare analytes across sample types. Due to COVID-19 Waves 13 and 14 were implemented using computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) and web surveys. Wave 15 included additional data on body measurements. Respondents were asked to install the BodyVolume app on their smartphone or tablet (iOS or Android) and use it after the interview to take two photos of themselves. The app used the body outlines along with profile information that the respondent entered in the app (age, sex, height, weight, level of activity) to calculate measures including waist and hip circumference, total body fat, visceral body fat, and lengths of different body parts. Wave 16 included an experiment asking parents of children aged under 16 to supply health related information from the child’s red book. Respondents were also asked to install the Sea Hero Quest app and play a game that measures spatial cognition.Secure Access Dataset:The Understanding Society: Innovation Panel, Waves 1-16, 2008-2023 dataset contains British National Grid postcode grid references (at 1m resolution) for each household surveyed, derived from the ONS National Statistics Postcode Directories (NSPD). Grid references are presented in terms of Eastings and Northings, which are distances in metres (east and north, respectively) from the origin (0,0), which lies to the west of the Scilly Isles. Each grid reference is given a positional quality indicator to denote the accuracy of the grid reference. In the majority of cases, the assigned grid reference relates to the building of the matched address closest to the postcode mean. No grid references are provided for postcodes in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.The Secure Access version of Understanding Society: Innovation Panel 2008-2023 includes all files in the Special Licence version, plus files containing the 3 variables relating to the National Grid Reference for each household: Easting, Northing and positional quality indicator (OSGRDIND). All other files are the same as in the Special Licence version, which is held under SN 7083.Related UK Data Archive studies:The Secure Access version of the dataset has more restrictive access conditions than standard End User Licence or Special Licence access datasets (see 'Access' section). Further details and links to the less restrictive versions can be found on the Understanding Society series Key data page.Latest edition informationFor the 11th edition (November 2024), Wave 16 has been deposited with accompanying documentation. All previous waves have also been redeposited with various corrections - see '7332_ip_waves_1-15_changes_collated.pdf' for details of the changes.Co-fundersIn addition to the Economic and Social Research Council, co-funders for the study included the Department of Work and Pensions, the Department for Education, the Department for Transport, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, the Department for Community and Local Government, the Department of Health, the Scottish Government, the Welsh Assembly Government, the Northern Ireland Executive, the Department of Environment and Rural Affairs, and the Food Standards Agency.
The survey instrument is constructed using modules. For a fuller listing of modules and questionnaire content see the ISER Innovation Panel Dataset Documentation webpage. Experiments are described in the User Manual for the Innovation Panel.
The household questionnaire includes a composition listing of all household members and collects information about gender, date of birth, marital and employment status, and relationship to the household respondent. The household questionnaire also has questions about housing, mortgage or rent payments, material deprivation, and consumer durables and cars. The individual interview is asked of every person in the household aged 16 or over, and covers: demographics, baseline information, family background, ethnicity and national identity; religion; partnership and fertility histories; health, disability and caring; current employment and earnings; parenting and childcare arrangements; contact with non-resident children; benefit payments; and household finances. A proxy module, a much shortened version of the individual questionnaire, collects demographic, health, and employment information, as well as a summary income measure.
The adult self-completion questionnaire was a pencil-and-paper instrument (PAPI) at Waves 1 and 3, and in Waves 4-7 included an experimental comparison with Computer Assisted Self-Completion (CASI). It includes subjective questions, particularly those which are potentially sensitive or require more privacy. It covers feelings of depression, sleep behaviour, neighbourhood participation and belonging, life satisfaction, and attributes of friends. There was no adult self-completion questionnaire at Wave 2.
The youth self-completion questionnaire (also PAPI) is given to children aged 10-15 years in the household. It covers computer and technology use; relationships with parents; feelings about areas of life; Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ); and educational plans. In wave 16 children were given the choice of completing the youth questionnaire online or in PAPI.1a:T1bb6,Understanding Society (UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, and the survey research organisations Verian Group and NatCen.
