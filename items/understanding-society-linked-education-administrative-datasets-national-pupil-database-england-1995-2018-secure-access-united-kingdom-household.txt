Latest edition information

The third edition (November 2020) includes Understanding Society participants who gave consent at Wave 4 and could be linked to the National Pupil Database (NPD). It includes NPD data up to academic year 2017/18. It also contains
Understanding Society participants who gave consent and could be linked at Wave 1 and did not re-consent at Wave 4. NPD data up to academic year 2012/13 is included for these participants.

Topics covered in the data files include educational attainment scores, test/examination results, and school absences and exclusions, with a linking variable for matching with
Understanding Society data as noted in the Abstract section above. Local authority identifiers and individual school codes are included in the data. Demographic information such as ethnic groups, languages spoken at home, deprivation indices, eligibility for free school meals and special educational needs is also included in the PLASC Census file. See documentation for further details.18:T84c,Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) studies 21st century UK life and how it is changing. It captures important information every year about the social and economic circumstances, attitudes, behaviours and health of people living in thousands of UK households.

Information from the longitudinal survey is primarily used by academics, researchers and policy makers in their work, but the findings are of interest to a much wider group of people including those working in the third sector, health practitioners, business, the media and the general public.

Interviews began in 2009 with eligible members of nearly 32,000 selected households invited to take part. Adults are interviewed and 10-15 year-olds fill in a paper self-completion questionnaire. New people join the study as they join the households of existing members, and if members leave their households, all adult members of their new household are interviewed. In 2010-11, some 20,000 participants aged over 16 also received nurse visits and provided a blood sample and some basic physical measurements (height, weight, blood pressure, grip strength). Data collection is annual, but each wave takes place over a two year period, with the second year of one wave overlapping the first year of the subsequent wave (so wave 1 took place between 2009 and 2011, wave 2 between 2010 and 2012, and so forth). 

A further 8,000 households from the British Household Panel Survey (see below) were invited to join at wave 2.

An additional 1,500 UK households are interviewed for the Innovation Panel, a separate annual survey which is used by researchers as a test bed for new ways of collecting data or exploring new topics before they become part of the main survey.

UKHLS also has an ethnicity strand, with boost samples to ensure the study had at least 1,000 adults from the five main ethnicity groups in the UK. There are also extra questions asked each year of particular relevance to ethnic groups. In 2015, a further immigrant and ethnic boost sample was added to the study.

19:Tc98,Understanding Society (UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, and the survey research organisations Verian Group and NatCen. It builds on and incorporates the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which began in 1991.
Secure Access Dataset:
The Understanding Society: Linked Education Administrative Datasets (National Pupil Database), England, 1995-2018: Secure Access study contains nine files extracted from the
National Pupil Database (NPD) for England. These can be linked (within the Secure Access service) to
Understanding Society participants using the cross-wave personal identifier (variable pidp). The NPD files include information on pupil background, attainment, school absences and exclusions for all individuals with a valid consent to education linkage collected in Waves 1 and 4 of Understanding Society. This includes consents collected from parents of children aged 4-15 and of young adults aged 16+ and born in 1981 or later. The included files cover Pupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC) data on pupil background; pupil attainment data for the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile (EYFSP) (age 5) and Key Stages (KS) 1 (age 7), KS2 (age 11), KS3 (age 14), KS4 (age 16) and KS5 (ages 17-18); and absences and exclusions (ages 4-18). See documentation for further details.

Related UK Data Archive studies:
The equivalent study to this one that covers Scotland is in preparation.
This study is frequently linked through the pidp variable to one of the main Understanding Society datasets: SN 6614 (End User Licence), SN 6931 (Special Licence) or SN 6676 (Secure Access). A Special Licence dataset containing School Codes for the main Understanding Society study (SN 7182) is also available. Further details can be found on the

Understanding Society series Key data webpage.

The Archive also holds separate (i.e. not linked to Understanding Society) data from the
National Pupil Database, available under Secure Access and Safe Room Access conditions. See SNs 7626, 7627 and 7628 (Secure Access) and SNs 7590, 7625, 7600, 7595, 7612 and 7606 (Safe Room Access) for details.
Latest edition information

The third edition (November 2020) includes Understanding Society participants who gave consent at Wave 4 and could be linked to the National Pupil Database (NPD). It includes NPD data up to academic year 2017/18. It also contains
Understanding Society participants who gave consent and could be linked at Wave 1 and did not re-consent at Wave 4. NPD data up to academic year 2012/13 is included for these participants.

Topics covered in the data files include educational attainment scores, test/examination results, and school absences and exclusions, with a linking variable for matching with
Understanding Society data as noted in the Abstract section above. Local authority identifiers and individual school codes are included in the data. Demographic information such as ethnic groups, languages spoken at home, deprivation indices, eligibility for free school meals and special educational needs is also included in the PLASC Census file.
