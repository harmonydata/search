It captures important information every year about the social and economic circumstances, attitudes, behaviours and health of people living in thousands of UK households.

Information from the longitudinal survey is primarily used by academics, researchers and policy makers in their work, but the findings are of interest to a much wider group of people including those working in the third sector, health practitioners, business, the media and the general public.

Interviews began in 2009 with eligible members of nearly 32,000 selected households invited to take part. Adults are interviewed and 10-15 year-olds fill in a paper self-completion questionnaire. New people join the study as they join the households of existing members, and if members leave their households, all adult members of their new household are interviewed. In 2010-11, some 20,000 participants aged over 16 also received nurse visits and provided a blood sample and some basic physical measurements (height, weight, blood pressure, grip strength). Data collection is annual, but each wave takes place over a two year period, with the second year of one wave overlapping the first year of the subsequent wave (so wave 1 took place between 2009 and 2011, wave 2 between 2010 and 2012, and so forth). 

A further 8,000 households from the British Household Panel Survey (see below) were invited to join at wave 2.

An additional 1,500 UK households are interviewed for the Innovation Panel, a separate annual survey which is used by researchers as a test bed for new ways of collecting data or exploring new topics before they become part of the main survey.

UKHLS also has an ethnicity strand, with boost samples to ensure the study had at least 1,000 adults from the five main ethnicity groups in the UK. There are also extra questions asked each year of particular relevance to ethnic groups. In 2015, a further immigrant and ethnic boost sample was added to the study.

The Understanding Society: Linked Nest Auto-enrolment Pensions Dataset, 2014-2022: Secure Access study contains a file extracted from the National Employment Savings Trust (Nest), a defined contribution workplace pension scheme set up as part of the UK government's workplace pension reforms under the Pensions Act 2008, with the first members being brought into the scheme in October 2012. This file can be linked (within the UK Data Service Secure Lab) to Understanding Society participants using the cross-wave personal identifier (variable pidp). For all individuals with a valid consent to Nest linkage collected in Wave 11 of Understanding Society, and a Nest account, the data file includes information on: participation in, and levels of savings and withdrawals within, the UK's pensions auto-enrolment system; workers' behaviour within the workplace pensions system; labour market dynamics, including earnings patterns broken down into individual employments. See the documentation for further details.This study is designed to be used in conjunction with one of the main Understanding Society studies (SN 6614, SN 6931 or SN 6676) using pidp as the linking variable. Further details can be found on the

Understanding Society series webpage.  Topics covered in the data files include involvement in and interaction with the auto-enrolment system, including: the start and end months of all enrolments into the Nest scheme contributions paid by the individual, the employer and the government (in tax relief)savings balances, withdrawals and other behaviours within the Nest scheme start and end date of any employments with employers using Nest as their auto-enrolment pension schememonthly pensionable earnings received in each of these employments - as normalised from weekly, fortnightly or monthly payroll data received by Nest from the employerSee the documentation for further details.1a:T8bb,Understanding Society (UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, and the survey research organisations Verian Group and NatCen.
