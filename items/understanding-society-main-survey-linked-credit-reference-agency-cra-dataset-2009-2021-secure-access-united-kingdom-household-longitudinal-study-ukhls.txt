It captures important information every year about the social and economic circumstances, attitudes, behaviours and health of people living in thousands of UK households.

Information from the longitudinal survey is primarily used by academics, researchers and policy makers in their work, but the findings are of interest to a much wider group of people including those working in the third sector, health practitioners, business, the media and the general public.

Interviews began in 2009 with eligible members of nearly 32,000 selected households invited to take part. Adults are interviewed and 10-15 year-olds fill in a paper self-completion questionnaire. New people join the study as they join the households of existing members, and if members leave their households, all adult members of their new household are interviewed. In 2010-11, some 20,000 participants aged over 16 also received nurse visits and provided a blood sample and some basic physical measurements (height, weight, blood pressure, grip strength). Data collection is annual, but each wave takes place over a two year period, with the second year of one wave overlapping the first year of the subsequent wave (so wave 1 took place between 2009 and 2011, wave 2 between 2010 and 2012, and so forth). 

A further 8,000 households from the British Household Panel Survey (see below) were invited to join at wave 2.

An additional 1,500 UK households are interviewed for the Innovation Panel, a separate annual survey which is used by researchers as a test bed for new ways of collecting data or exploring new topics before they become part of the main survey.

UKHLS also has an ethnicity strand, with boost samples to ensure the study had at least 1,000 adults from the five main ethnicity groups in the UK. There are also extra questions asked each year of particular relevance to ethnic groups. In 2015, a further immigrant and ethnic boost sample was added to the study.

19:T8c8,Understanding Society (UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, and the survey research organisations Verian Group and NatCen. It builds on and incorporates the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which began in 1991. The Understanding Society: Main Survey, Linked Credit Reference Agency (CRA) Dataset, 2009-2021: Secure Access study contains, for study participants who provided consent, a file containing credit histories collected by a Credit Reference Agency (CRA) before being linked to their study records by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).The data in this study can be linked through the pidp variable to one of the main Understanding Society datasets: SN 6614 (End User Licence), SN 6931 (Special Licence) or SN 6676 (Secure Access). Further details on those studies can be found on the Understanding Society series webpage.For all individuals with a valid consent to CRA linkage collected in Wave 10 of Understanding Society, the data file contains detailed information on credit items held by individuals. The monthly dataset that has been linked to the main survey sample covers a period of twelve years (2009-2021). A credit item is a (typically financial) product taken out by an individual. Credit items contained in the CRA data include current accounts, mortgages, credit items (e.g. personal loans, motor finance, credit cards, retail credit and subprime credit such as payday loans) as well as some household bills (e.g. mobile phones, gas and electric bills but not council taxes).See documentation for further details.
The main topic covered in the data files is information on credit items and their histories, including: current accounts; mortgages; running cards (credit cards and store cards); personal loans; motor finance; retail finance; ‘other running’ (card accounts such as mail order and charge cards); home collected high cost credit (rent to own, logbook loans, home credit, guarantor’s loans); household bill accounts (credit accounts pertaining to household expenses such as electricity, gas, water); telecommunications company credit accounts.
