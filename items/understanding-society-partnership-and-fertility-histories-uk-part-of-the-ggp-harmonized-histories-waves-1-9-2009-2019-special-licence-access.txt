Two datasets are provided. The first includes all people aged 16 or over who participated in the full interview of Wave 1 of the
Understanding Society project and the data as is collected at Wave 1. The second dataset follows the people who are in the first dataset prospectively. Thus, it includes all the retrospective information from the first dataset and has been updated when things changed, for instance the partners got married or had children. For more information please refer to the User Guide.
