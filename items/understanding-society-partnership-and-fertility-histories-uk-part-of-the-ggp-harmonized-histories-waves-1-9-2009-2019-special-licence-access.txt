It captures important information every year about the social and economic circumstances, attitudes, behaviours and health of people living in thousands of UK households.

Information from the longitudinal survey is primarily used by academics, researchers and policy makers in their work, but the findings are of interest to a much wider group of people including those working in the third sector, health practitioners, business, the media and the general public.

Interviews began in 2009 with eligible members of nearly 32,000 selected households invited to take part. Adults are interviewed and 10-15 year-olds fill in a paper self-completion questionnaire. New people join the study as they join the households of existing members, and if members leave their households, all adult members of their new household are interviewed. In 2010-11, some 20,000 participants aged over 16 also received nurse visits and provided a blood sample and some basic physical measurements (height, weight, blood pressure, grip strength). Data collection is annual, but each wave takes place over a two year period, with the second year of one wave overlapping the first year of the subsequent wave (so wave 1 took place between 2009 and 2011, wave 2 between 2010 and 2012, and so forth). 

A further 8,000 households from the British Household Panel Survey (see below) were invited to join at wave 2.

An additional 1,500 UK households are interviewed for the Innovation Panel, a separate annual survey which is used by researchers as a test bed for new ways of collecting data or exploring new topics before they become part of the main survey.

UKHLS also has an ethnicity strand, with boost samples to ensure the study had at least 1,000 adults from the five main ethnicity groups in the UK. There are also extra questions asked each year of particular relevance to ethnic groups. In 2015, a further immigrant and ethnic boost sample was added to the study.

The Harmonized Histories is an international comparative dataset, created through harmonising data from existing surveys into one common format. The aim of
Harmonized Histories is to facilitate cross-national research on topics related to transition to adulthood, family formation, and childbearing. The dataset focuses on fertility and partnership histories but also captures information on socio-economic status, place of residence and information on the childhood family. You can find more information about
Harmonized Histories and access to the datasets from other countries via the Generations & Gender Programme (GGP) website.





Two datasets are provided. The first includes all people aged 16 or over who participated in the full interview of Wave 1 of the
Understanding Society project and the data as is collected at Wave 1. The second dataset follows the people who are in the first dataset prospectively. Thus, it includes all the retrospective information from the first dataset and has been updated when things changed, for instance the partners got married or had children. For more information please refer to the User Guide.

Harmonized Histories uses
Understanding Society for data on the UK. As Harmonized Histories is a cross-national project, please note that the variable naming conventions and terminology used in this dataset are different to the standard
Understanding Society naming and terms.
