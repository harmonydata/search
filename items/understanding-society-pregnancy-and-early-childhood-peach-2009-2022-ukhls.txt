Latest edition information
For the third edition (March 2024), data from Wave 13 of the main study have been added to the data file, and the user guide has been updated accordingly.
Co-funders
In addition to the Economic and Social Research Council, co-funders for the study included the Department of Work and Pensions, the Department for Education, the Department for Transport, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, the Department for Community and Local Government, the Department of Health, the Scottish Government, the Welsh Assembly Government, the Northern Ireland Executive, the Department of Environment and Rural Affairs, and the Food Standards Agency.1b:T84c,Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) studies 21st century UK life and how it is changing. It captures important information every year about the social and economic circumstances, attitudes, behaviours and health of people living in thousands of UK households.

Information from the longitudinal survey is primarily used by academics, researchers and policy makers in their work, but the findings are of interest to a much wider group of people including those working in the third sector, health practitioners, business, the media and the general public.

Interviews began in 2009 with eligible members of nearly 32,000 selected households invited to take part. Adults are interviewed and 10-15 year-olds fill in a paper self-completion questionnaire. New people join the study as they join the households of existing members, and if members leave their households, all adult members of their new household are interviewed. In 2010-11, some 20,000 participants aged over 16 also received nurse visits and provided a blood sample and some basic physical measurements (height, weight, blood pressure, grip strength). Data collection is annual, but each wave takes place over a two year period, with the second year of one wave overlapping the first year of the subsequent wave (so wave 1 took place between 2009 and 2011, wave 2 between 2010 and 2012, and so forth). 

A further 8,000 households from the British Household Panel Survey (see below) were invited to join at wave 2.

An additional 1,500 UK households are interviewed for the Innovation Panel, a separate annual survey which is used by researchers as a test bed for new ways of collecting data or exploring new topics before they become part of the main survey.

UKHLS also has an ethnicity strand, with boost samples to ensure the study had at least 1,000 adults from the five main ethnicity groups in the UK. There are also extra questions asked each year of particular relevance to ethnic groups. In 2015, a further immigrant and ethnic boost sample was added to the study.

1c:Tbd8,Understanding Society, (UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex and the survey research organisations Verian Group (formerly Kantar Public) and NatCen. It builds on and incorporates, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which began in 1991.

Understanding Society (UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex and the survey research organisations Kantar Public and NatCen. It builds on and incorporates, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which began in 1991.
The annual information across a wide range of topics gathered as part of Understanding Society before and after childbirth, coupled with data on the entire family, provides contextual insight into the development of children. Moreover, all children in the household are themselves participants of Understanding Society from birth, parents provide information on their child’s health and development until the age of 10, when data is gathered directly from all children.
The Pregnancy and Early Childhood (PEACH) dataset consists of a single crosswave file that brings together the key data reported by parents for all children aged under 10 years as reported in the w_child file, w_newborn file and information on pregnancy and parenting styles from w_indresp files across waves 1 to 13 of the main study. The information is provided at the child level using the child's identifier (crosswave person identifier - pidp) to ensure each row is uniquely identifiable. In addition, the pidp of the parent or responsible adult providing information at different waves is included to make it easy to link back to family circumstances. A total of 303 variables are included, created from 164 questions. Full details can be found in the user guide.
This dataset is designed to be linked to the main Understanding Society datasets SN 6614 (end user licence), SN 6931 (special licence) or SN 6676 (secure access), so that the child’s development can be related to their broader family circumstances. Information can be linked for the child using the crosswave personal identifier variables beginning with “pidp” as appropriate or for the parent providing the information.
Latest edition information
For the third edition (March 2024), data from Wave 13 of the main study have been added to the data file, and the user guide has been updated accordingly.
Co-funders
In addition to the Economic and Social Research Council, co-funders for the study included the Department of Work and Pensions, the Department for Education, the Department for Transport, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, the Department for Community and Local Government, the Department of Health, the Scottish Government, the Welsh Assembly Government, the Northern Ireland Executive, the Department of Environment and Rural Affairs, and the Food Standards Agency.10:{"metadata":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Understanding Society: Pregnancy and Early Childhood (PEACH), 2009-2022 / UKHLS"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"$1c"}],["$","meta","2",{"property":"og:title","content":"Understanding Society: Pregnancy and Early Childhood (PEACH), 2009-2022 / UKHLS"}],"$L1d","$L1e","$L1f","$L20","$L21","$L22","$L23","$L24","$L25","$L26","$L27","$L28","$L29","$L2a","$L2b"],"error":null,"digest":"$undefined"}
