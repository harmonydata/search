It builds on and incorporates, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which began in 1991. 
The Understanding Society: UKMOD Input Data, 2010-2019: Special Licence Access dataset provides input data for the longitudinal version of the UKMOD microsimulation model. The longitudinal version of UKMOD runs on Understanding Society data and covers the period 2010-2019 (Waves 1-11). The UKHLS is a large panel survey with a sample of approximately 40,000 households in its first wave. It contains detailed income data and a wide range of demographic and labour market information. As such it is the primary survey of interest in the UK for those interested in longitudinal analysis.
UKMOD is a tax-benefit microsimulation model (MSM) for the UK and its constituent nations (England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland) that originated from EUROMOD. Since 2020 UK MOD has replaced, as a stand-alone model, the UK component of EUROMOD. UKMOD is freely accessible, released open-source, and thoroughly documented and validated using external data. The standard cross-sectional version of UKMOD uses the Family Resources Survey (FRS) as its input dataset.
A tax-benefit microsimulation model is a computer code that calculates disposable income for each micro-unit (such as individual or household) in a representative sample of the population, under a specific policy scenario. Based on micro-level information about the individual and household characteristics and on legislative rules, UKMOD simulates the amount of fiscal liabilities and benefit entitlements at the tax-benefit unit level.
Tax-benefit microsimulation models are used to answer &quot;what if&quot; questions about the effects of tax and benefit reforms on household incomes and the income distribution. Such analysis is regularly performed for Budget and other Government policy announcements, and is also highly relevant for the design of alternative reforms and new policy instruments taking account of the diverse economic circumstances of the UK population. The longitudinal version of the data allows researchers to address additional questions, for example about the evolution of outcomes of interest over time. It also allows UKMOD outputs to be linked with additional information not used by the tax and benefit model but present in the UKHLS data for example, about labour market activity, retirement, health and wellbeing and others.SN 9147 can be used on its own with UKMOD and is sufficient to conduct typical UKMOD analysis. For applicants seeking to add additional Understanding Society variables not included in the UKMOD dataset SN 9147, accessing SN 6614 (Safeguarded / EUL) and linking it to dataset SN 9147 normally provides a sufficient level of detail. However, in some instances, the desired variables may only be available in the safeguarded / Special Licence equivalent, SN 6931. Full details of how to link the datasets are provided in the User Guide.

It captures important information every year about the social and economic circumstances, attitudes, behaviours and health of people living in thousands of UK households.\n\nInformation from the longitudinal survey is primarily used by academics, researchers and policy makers in their work, but the findings are of interest to a much wider group of people including those working in the third sector, health practitioners, business, the media and the general public.\n\nInterviews began in 2009 with eligible members of nearly 32,000 selected households invited to take part. Adults are interviewed and 10-15 year-olds fill in a paper self-completion questionnaire. New people join the study as they join the households of existing members, and if members leave their households, all adult members of their new household are interviewed. In 2010-11, some 20,000 participants aged over 16 also received nurse visits and provided a blood sample and some basic physical measurements (height, weight, blood pressure, grip strength). Data collection is annual, but each wave takes place over a two year period, with the second year of one wave overlapping the first year of the subsequent wave (so wave 1 took place between 2009 and 2011, wave 2 between 2010 and 2012, and so forth). \n\nA further 8,000 households from the British Household Panel Survey (see below) were invited to join at wave 2.\n\nAn additional 1,500 UK households are interviewed for the Innovation Panel, a separate annual survey which is used by researchers as a test bed for new ways of collecting data or exploring new topics before they become part of the main survey.\n\nUKHLS also has an ethnicity strand, with boost samples to ensure the study had at least 1,000 adults from the five main ethnicity groups in the UK. There are also extra questions asked each year of particular relevance to ethnic groups. In 2015, a further immigrant and ethnic boost sample was added to the study.\n\nStudy website: https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"18:[\"$\",\"$L19\",null,{\"study\":{\"dataset_schema\":{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Dataset\",\"name\":\"Understanding Society: UKMOD Input Data, 2010-2019: Special Licence Access / UKHLS\",\"description\":\"$1a\",\"url\":[\"https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=9147\"],\"keywords\":[\"Diet and nutrition\",\"Covid-19 data collection\",\"Biomarkers\",\"Cognitive measures\",\"Work and employment\",\"Social care -

It builds on and incorporates, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which began in 1991. \nThe Understanding Society: UKMOD Input Data, 2010-2019: Special Licence Access dataset provides input data for the longitudinal version of the UKMOD microsimulation model. The longitudinal version of UKMOD runs on Understanding Society data and covers the period 2010-2019 (Waves 1-11). The UKHLS is a large panel survey with a sample of approximately 40,000 households in its first wave. It contains detailed income data and a wide range of demographic and labour market information. As such it is the primary survey of interest in the UK for those interested in longitudinal analysis.\nUKMOD is a tax-benefit microsimulation model (MSM) for the UK and its constituent nations (England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland) that originated from EUROMOD. Since 2020 UK MOD has replaced, as a stand-alone model, the UK component of EUROMOD. UKMOD is freely accessible, released open-source, and thoroughly documented and validated using external data. The standard cross-sectional version of UKMOD uses the Family Resources Survey (FRS) as its input dataset.\nA tax-benefit microsimulation model is a computer code that calculates disposable income for each micro-unit (such as individual or household) in a representative sample of the population, under a specific policy scenario. Based on micro-level information about the individual and household characteristics and on legislative rules, UKMOD simulates the amount of fiscal liabilities and benefit entitlements at the tax-benefit unit level.\nTax-benefit microsimulation models are used to answer \"what if\" questions about the effects of tax and benefit reforms on household incomes and the income distribution. Such analysis is regularly performed for Budget and other Government policy announcements, and is also highly relevant for the design of alternative reforms and new policy instruments taking account of the diverse economic circumstances of the UK population. The longitudinal version of the data allows researchers to address additional questions, for example about the evolution of outcomes of interest over time. It also allows UKMOD outputs to be linked with additional information not used by the tax and benefit model but present in the UKHLS data for example, about labour market activity, retirement, health and wellbeing and others.SN 9147 can be used on its own with UKMOD and is sufficient to conduct typical UKMOD analysis. For applicants seeking to add additional Understanding Society variables not included in the UKMOD dataset SN 9147, accessing SN 6614 (Safeguarded / EUL) and linking it to dataset SN 9147 normally provides a sufficient level of detail. However, in some instances, the desired variables may only be available in the safeguarded / Special Licence equivalent, SN 6931.
