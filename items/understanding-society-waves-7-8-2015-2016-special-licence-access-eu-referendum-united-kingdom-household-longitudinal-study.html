Understanding Society (UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex and the survey research organisations Kantar Public and NatCen. It builds on and incorporates, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which began in 1991.
The Understanding Society: Waves 7-8, 2015-2016: Special Licence Access, EU Referendum dataset was constructed in order to provide researchers early access to a question asked in Wave 8 on whether the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union. The dataset in this release was constructed from the first year’s respondents of Wave 8. It was not subjected to the full processing that a full Wave receives and not all data files were released. As a consequence the data was only supplied directly by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) to researchers who submitted approved research proposals utilising the EU Referendum question. As Wave 7 had also not been released at the time the corresponding Wave 7 data was also supplied. It is this Wave 7 and Wave 8 data that forms this release.
These data have more restrictive access conditions than those available under the standard End User Licence (see &#x27;Access&#x27; section). This dataset will only be supplied for verification of research conducted using the early access data that was supplied directly by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) for approved research utilising the EU Referendum question. Users wishing to utilise the question for future research can access it in Wave 8 of the standard Understanding Society dataset (SN 6614). Those users who wish to make an application for these data should contact the Help Desk for further details. Understanding Society data are included from the first four quarters of wave 7 and wave 8 fieldwork, i.e. households that were issued for fieldwork from January 2016 up to and including December 2016. Some respondents will have completed their interviews in 2017 despite being issued to fieldwork in 2016. The files included are:

It captures important information every year about the social and economic circumstances, attitudes, behaviours and health of people living in thousands of UK households.\n\nInformation from the longitudinal survey is primarily used by academics, researchers and policy makers in their work, but the findings are of interest to a much wider group of people including those working in the third sector, health practitioners, business, the media and the general public.\n\nInterviews began in 2009 with eligible members of nearly 32,000 selected households invited to take part. Adults are interviewed and 10-15 year-olds fill in a paper self-completion questionnaire. New people join the study as they join the households of existing members, and if members leave their households, all adult members of their new household are interviewed. In 2010-11, some 20,000 participants aged over 16 also received nurse visits and provided a blood sample and some basic physical measurements (height, weight, blood pressure, grip strength). Data collection is annual, but each wave takes place over a two year period, with the second year of one wave overlapping the first year of the subsequent wave (so wave 1 took place between 2009 and 2011, wave 2 between 2010 and 2012, and so forth). \n\nA further 8,000 households from the British Household Panel Survey (see below) were invited to join at wave 2.\n\nAn additional 1,500 UK households are interviewed for the Innovation Panel, a separate annual survey which is used by researchers as a test bed for new ways of collecting data or exploring new topics before they become part of the main survey.\n\nUKHLS also has an ethnicity strand, with boost samples to ensure the study had at least 1,000 adults from the five main ethnicity groups in the UK. There are also extra questions asked each year of particular relevance to ethnic groups. In 2015, a further immigrant and ethnic boost sample was added to the study.\n\nStudy website: https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1b:[\"$\",\"$L1c\",null,{\"study\":{\"dataset_schema\":{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Dataset\",\"name\":\"Understanding Society: Waves 7-8, 2015-2016: Special Licence Access, EU Referendum / United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study\",\"description\":\"$1d\",\"url\":[\"https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8556\"],\"keywords\":[\"Diet and nutrition\",\"Covid-19 data collection\",\"Biomarkers\",\"Cognitive measures\",\"Work and employment\",\"Social care -
