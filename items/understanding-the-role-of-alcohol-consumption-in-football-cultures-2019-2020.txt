The cultural acceptance and normalisation of alcohol use, coupled with regular exposure to alcohol marketing through sponsorship and advertising, means that football offers a particularly illuminating location for understanding contemporary consumption of alcohol. The collection includes data from an online survey with football supporters, transcripts of focus groups with football fans in Scotland and England and photos taken by football fans on the theme of alcohol and football. We explored the acceptability of alcohol at football matches and the role that it plays for those attending football matches in England and Scotland. Findings from our photovoice study illustrate the  major role that alcohol plays for many fans who attend football matches in Scotland and England with many reporting positive aspects regarding socialising and atmosphere. Alcohol culture and fan culture mutually shape alcohol consumption practices during a match-day experience with the type of alcohol consumption dependent on multiple factors including the distance of travel to the stadium, the length of time before kick-off, the size of the travelling support and existing legislation regarding the availability of alcohol at football matches.Alcohol consumption in the UK remains high compared to historical estimates and consumption elsewhere in the world.

2d:Tea0,Alcohol consumption in the UK, particularly higher-risk drinking, remains high compared to historical estimates and consumption levels elsewhere in the world. It is argued that the widespread acceptance of drinking and consumption patterns in the UK population, combined with liberal changes in government policy related to alcohol (e.g. extended opening hours), has created a ‘culture of intoxication’ where higher-risk consumption is a normalised and regular occurrence. One setting where alcohol takes a central role is watching or attending football matches. The cultural acceptance and normalisation of alcohol use, coupled with regular exposure to alcohol marketing through sponsorship and advertising, means that football offers a particularly illuminating location for understanding contemporary consumption of alcohol. The collection includes data from an online survey with football supporters, transcripts of focus groups with football fans in Scotland and England and photos taken by football fans on the theme of alcohol and football. We explored the acceptability of alcohol at football matches and the role that it plays for those attending football matches in England and Scotland. Findings from our photovoice study illustrate the  major role that alcohol plays for many fans who attend football matches in Scotland and England with many reporting positive aspects regarding socialising and atmosphere. Alcohol culture and fan culture mutually shape alcohol consumption practices during a match-day experience with the type of alcohol consumption dependent on multiple factors including the distance of travel to the stadium, the length of time before kick-off, the size of the travelling support and existing legislation regarding the availability of alcohol at football matches.Alcohol consumption in the UK remains high compared to historical estimates and consumption elsewhere in the world. It is argued that the widespread acceptance of drinking in the UK population, combined with liberal changes in government policy related to alcohol (e.g. extended opening hours), has created a 'culture of intoxication' where higher-risk consumption is a normalised and regular occurrence. Understanding the drivers of consumption, and the place it has in society, is important given that higher-risk consumption costs the UK Government an estimated £21bn a year. One setting where alcohol takes a central role is attending or watching football matches on television.
The cultural acceptance and normalisation of alcohol use coupled with regular exposure to alcohol marketing through high profile sponsorship deals means that football offers a particularly illuminating location for understanding contemporary consumption of alcohol. This study will extend current understanding by considering the impact of watching football on drinking practices in a wider group of football watchers, exploring differences in England and Scotland, and potential implications for regulatory change. This research is highly relevant given the recurrent political debate surrounding the restrictions on alcohol consumption at football grounds in both Scotland and England. The findings of this study will help to generate evidence to inform policies on alcohol and football.
The key objective of this research is to provide evidence of the role alcohol plays and the motivations for consumption for various groups attending and watching football matches in order to help prevent excessive/binge consumption and violent or antisocial behaviour. It will also assess the impact that existing regulations designed to restrict the consumption of alcohol at football matches have on the consumption of alcohol for those attending or watching a match.28:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2d"}]
