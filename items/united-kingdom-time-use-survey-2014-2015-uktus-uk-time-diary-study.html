At the heart of the survey is a time diary instrument in which respondents record their daily activities. Time diaries record events sequences for prescribed periods, usually a single day. They are an effective means of capturing rich data on how people spend their time, their location throughout the day, and who they spend their time with. The sample was based on households, and household members eight years and over completed time-diaries for one weekday and one weekend day. In addition, those in paid work were asked to complete a weekly work schedule. All individuals who completed a time diary were invited to take part in an interview, and someone in the household was selected to take part in a household interview. These interviews provide additional demographic, economic, and social information about households and individuals. 

The UKTUS 2014-15 was designed to be, as far as possible, compatible both with the previous UK Time Use Survey, conducted by ONS in 2000-2001 (see under SN 4504) and with other European time use studies carried out in since 2008 (not currently held at the UK Data Archive). It followed the Eurostat 2008 guidelines on Harmonised European Time Use Studies (HETUS), but was tailored to the needs and requirements of UK users. In particular, specific fields for mobile device use and enjoyment of time were added to the UKTUS 2014-2015 diary. In line with the key aims of the study, all data have been deposited with the UK Data Archive, to be made available for analysis by government and academic users.

 This study provides information about the time use of individuals 8 years and over on a weekday and a weekend day using time-diary instruments. The time-diaries provide information about activities, location, co-presence, the use of computers and mobile devices, and level of enjoyment of time throughout the day.

The sample was based on households, and household members eight years and over completed time-diaries for one weekday and one weekend day. In addition, those in paid work were asked to complete a weekly work schedule.
