It provides an opportunity to monitor experiences of health and provides data to assist with registration of trusts and monitoring on-going compliance. Understanding what people think about the care and treatment they receive is crucial to improving the quality of care being delivered by healthcare organisations. One way of doing this is by asking people who have recently used the health service to tell the Care Quality Commission (CQC) about their experiences.
The CQC will use the results from the surveys in the regulation, monitoring and inspection of NHS acute trusts (or, for community mental health service user surveys, providers of mental health services) in England. Data are used in CQC Insight, an intelligence tool which identifies potential changes in quality of care and then supports deciding on the right regulatory response. Survey data will also be used to support CQC inspections.

Each survey has a different focus. These include patients&#x27; experiences in outpatient and accident and emergency departments in Acute Trusts, and the experiences of people using mental health services in the community.

History of the programme
The National Patient Survey Programme began in 2002, and was then conducted by the Commission for Health Improvement (CHI), along with the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (CHAI). Administration of the programme was taken over by the Healthcare Commission in time for the 2004 series. On 1 April 2009, the CQC was formed, which replaced the Healthcare Commission.

Further information about the National Patient Survey Programme may be found on the CQC Patient Survey Programme web pages.

 Urgent and Emergency Care Survey, 2018Understanding what people think about the care and treatment they receive is crucial to improving the quality of care being delivered by healthcare organisations. One way of doing this is by asking people who have recently used the health service to tell us about their experiences.This survey looked at people’s experiences of using Type 1 (major A&amp;E) and Type 3 (urgent care centres, minor injury units, urgent treatment centres) urgent and emergency care services, from decision to attend to leaving. Understanding their experiences is essential to improving services and delivering high-quality care.The results are intended for use by NHS trusts to help them improve their performance as well as being an essential quality indicator for the work of organisations including the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and NHS England and NHS Improvement.The Care Quality Commission will use the results from the survey in the regulation, monitoring and inspection of NHS acute trusts in England. Data is used in CQC Insight, an intelligence tool which identifies potential changes in quality of care and then supports deciding on the right regulatory response. Survey data will also be used to support CQC inspections. NHS England and NHS Improvement will use the results of the Urgent and Emergency Care survey to check progress and improvement against the objectives set out in the NHS mandate, and the Department of Health &amp; Social Care will hold them to account for the outcomes they achieve. They will use the results to guide work to improve the quality of care provided by NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts and also in the development of policies aimed at improving the quality of care at a national level.The study was funded by Care Quality Commission and NHS Trusts throughout England.
