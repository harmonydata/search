The objectives of the project have been:
1. To appraise current DF provision and processes in four DFUs that are part of a forensic 
collaboration – both individually and as part of a regional framework – to understand the organisation and use of DF in investigations and identify best practices locally and regionally
2. To observe how DF processes and practices in the four units observed compare with those of other DFUs nationally
3. To understand how DF contributes to the analysis and interpretation of digital trace and how police forces, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and defence teams use digital evidence
3. To assess how occupational cultures, organisational arrangements and regulatory requirements
impact on inter and intra-professional exchanges and understandings of professionalism and expertise
4. To examine how DF fits in the wider delivery of forensic service support for the four forces, together with other in-house services such as crime scene investigation, and explore this process nationally
5. To document the concerns and expectations of key stakeholders, inform policy developments and
support the development of local, regional and national approaches to the application of DF in policing

Some of the areas the project has focused on consist of the management of digital trace within and outside DF units (DFUs), the impact of ISO17025 accreditation, the rise in demand for mobile phone analysis, risk assessment procedures, welfare and wellbeing of staff, professional development and support, and training.

The implications of the findings are currently explored through ongoing analysis. Common themes
raised by the DF practitioners interviewed included (1) change fatigue following the start of the
collaboration and subsequent processes of accreditation, (2) sparse resources, (3) officers’ partial understanding of how DF can contribute to investigations and their mixed ability to present a digital investigative strategy when submitting exhibits for DF analysis, (4) wellbeing, burnout and stress, (5) the lack of recognition for the service provided, (6) professional development and career progression opportunities and (7) cultural and organisational tensions as part of working in  collaboration. 

Equally, the officers interviewed outlined a number of related issues pertaining to: a) delays in the processing of digital trace, b) the impact of accreditation on DF service delivery, c) disclosure processes, d) CPS pressures and queries for additional evidence at very short notice, e) the lack of assistance for DMIs and CAs, f) senior investigating officers’ and police management’s uneven understanding of DF and the investment it required, g) frontline officers lack of digital awareness, especially when identifying, preserving and using digital trace and h) expectations working within the police service.Digital evidence can reveal a suspect&#x27;s intent to commit an offence and help establish when events occurred, where victims and suspects were and with whom they communicated. It has been increasingly used in examinations of homicides, sex crimes, missing persons, child sexual abuse, drug dealing, fraud and theft of personal information, as well as in civil disputes. As the volume of cases requiring digital forensic analysis and the amount of information to be processed in each case have risen rapidly in recent years, law enforcement agencies are struggling to address this demand. In this context, social science research is needed to illuminate how current practices can be improved and the ways in which the usefulness of digital evidence in crime detection can be maximized while preserving ethical acceptability, civil liberties and protecting both the victims and the wrongly accused. To date however, these critical issues remain under-explored and little is known about the deployment of digital forensic evidence in police inquiries and the organiational, professional and societal issues it raises.

This project aims to offer a theoretically grounded and empirically based ethnographic analysis of the digital forensic resources, practices and expertise mobilised to provide intelligence for on-going investigations and aid the prosecution of suspects. Focusing on areas of improvement prioritised with the input of digital forensics (DF) practitioners working across four police forces as part of a regional forensic collaboration, its main objectives are to examine current provision in the constabularies covered by this organizational arrangement and explore how DF capabilities are used in the production of digital evidence."/><meta property="og:title" content="Using Digital Forensics in Policing, 2018-2022"/><meta property="og:description" content="This project has examined the application of digital forensics (DF) in police investigations and the operational, organisational and professional opportunities and challenges this presents.

To appraise current DF provision and processes in four DFUs that are part of a forensic \\ncollaboration – both individually and as part of a regional framework – to understand the organisation and use of DF in investigations and identify best practices locally and regionally\\n2. To observe how DF processes and practices in the four units observed compare with those of other DFUs nationally\\n3.

To examine how DF fits in the wider delivery of forensic service support for the four forces, together with other in-house services such as crime scene investigation, and explore this process nationally\\n5. To document the concerns and expectations of key stakeholders, inform policy developments and\\nsupport the development of local, regional and national approaches to the application of DF in policing\\n\\nSome of the areas the project has focused on consist of the management of digital trace within and outside DF units (DFUs), the impact of ISO17025 accreditation, the rise in demand for mobile phone analysis, risk assessment procedures, welfare and wellbeing of staff, professional development and support, and training.\\n\\nThe implications of the findings are currently explored through ongoing analysis. Common themes\\nraised by the DF practitioners interviewed included (1) change fatigue following the start of the\\ncollaboration and subsequent processes of accreditation, (2) sparse resources, (3) officers’ partial understanding of how DF can contribute to investigations and their mixed ability to present a digital investigative strategy when submitting exhibits for DF analysis, (4) wellbeing, burnout and stress, (5) the lack of recognition for the service provided, (6) professional development and career progression opportunities and (7) cultural and organisational tensions as part of working in  collaboration. \\n\\nEqually, the officers interviewed outlined a number of related issues pertaining to: a) delays in the processing of digital trace, b) the impact of accreditation on DF service delivery, c) disclosure processes, d) CPS pressures and queries for additional evidence at very short notice, e) the lack of assistance for DMIs and CAs, f) senior investigating officers’ and police management’s uneven understanding of DF and the investment it required, g) frontline officers lack of digital awareness, especially when identifying, preserving and using digital trace and h) expectations working within the police service.Digital evidence can reveal a suspect's intent to commit an offence and help establish when events occurred, where victims and suspects were and with whom they communicated. It has been increasingly used in examinations of homicides, sex crimes, missing persons, child sexual abuse, drug dealing, fraud and theft of personal information, as well as in civil disputes. As the volume of cases requiring digital forensic analysis and the amount of information to be processed in each case have risen rapidly in recent years, law enforcement agencies are struggling to address this demand. In this context, social science research is needed to illuminate how current practices can be improved and the ways in which the usefulness of digital evidence in crime detection can be maximized while preserving ethical acceptability, civil liberties and protecting both the victims and the wrongly accused.
