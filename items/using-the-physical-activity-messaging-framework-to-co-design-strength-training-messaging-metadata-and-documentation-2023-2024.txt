While our research shows that older adults and exercise providers are unaware of exercise guidelines, the benefits of exercise participation, and where to turn to for support. 

Our mission is to connect older adults with the tailored exercise programs that are proven to lower the risk of disability and disease. Our platform will be an easy-to-use tool for doctors and exercise providers to support exercise awareness, knowledge, referral, and support while its use will lead to a happier, healthier, and more active population.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Using the Physical Activity Messaging Framework to Co-Design Strength Training Messaging: Metadata and Documentation, 2023-2024"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Using the Physical Activity Messaging Framework to Co-Design Strength Training Messaging: Metadata and Documentation, 2023-2024"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/using-the-physical-activity-messaging-framework-to-co-design-strength-training-messaging-metadata-and-documentation-2023-2024"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Using the Physical Activity Messaging Framework to Co-Design Strength Training Messaging: Metadata and Documentation, 2023-2024"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Using the Physical Activity Messaging Framework to Co-Design Strength Training Messaging: Metadata and Documentation, 2023-2024"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
