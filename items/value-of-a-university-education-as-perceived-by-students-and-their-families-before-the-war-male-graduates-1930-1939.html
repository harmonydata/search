Main variables: institution, father&#x27;s occupation, mother&#x27;s occupation, family of origin size, reasons for going to university, arts or sciences, subject, degree result, extent of family funding, state scholarship, local authority scholarship, board of education grant, school scholarship, university/college scholarship, loans taken out, other sources of support, teaching qualification, place of residence, vacation work, first occupation, other occupations, marital status, number of children, wife&#x27;s occupation before marriage, wife&#x27;s employment status after marriage, notes.
