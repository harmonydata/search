We taught 3-4-year-olds novel locomotion verbs. Children who saw iconic manner gestures during training generalized more verbs to novel events (first-order generalization) than children who saw interactive gestures (Exp. 1, N = 48; Exp. 2, N = 48) and path-tracing gestures (Exp. 3, N = 48). Furthermore, immediately (Exp. 1 &amp; 3) and after one week (Exp. 2), the iconic manner gesture group outperformed the control groups in subsequent generalization trials with different novel verbs (second-order generalization), although all groups saw interactive gestures. Thus, seeing iconic gestures that depict verb referents helps children (1) generalize individual verb meanings to novel events and (2) learn more verbs from the same sub-category. People naturally produce gestures when they speak. Little is still known about the role these gestures play in children&#x27;s language development. My research focused on the role of iconic gestures - gesticulations that accompany speech and illustrate what is being said. For instance, you can wiggle your index and middle fingers to depict &quot;walking&quot; or bring your hand to your mouth as if holding a glass to depict &quot;drinking&quot;. Children understand these iconic gestures by age 3 and my PhD research suggested that seeing adults produce these gestures while speaking is formative for children&#x27;s language learning. Studying the ways we can stimulate vocabulary growth in preschool-aged children is very important, because the vocabulary size and skills of children at this age are major predictors of later school success.
During the fellowship, I will collect data from one experiment with 3-year-old children that will help us to better understand how seeing iconic gestures facilitates word learning. I will visit local nurseries to play a computer-based word learning game with 96 children. I will publish my research findings from this experiment and from my PhD dissertation in two top-tier scientific journals in developmental psychology and I will present those research findings at one international conference on cognitive development, in Budapest, Hungary.
I will also develop a Leverhulme Postdoctoral Fellowship proposal that extends my PhD research. I will design a series of lab-based experiments that help us investigate how parents can use nonverbal communication (e.g. facial expressions, body language, and hand gestures) to teach their child new words. I will propose to analyse body position of the parent and child (face-to-face or side-by-side) and eye contact, touch, and gestures. 
Moreover, I will visit two internationally leading research groups to develop collaborative research on mother-child interactions. I will visit Simone Pika&#x27;s biocognition lab, which has collected video recordings of naturalistic social interactions between chimpanzee mothers and their young living in the wild. I will also visit with Susan Goldin-Meadow&#x27;s gesture lab, which has collected video recordings of naturalistic interactions between parents and children in their family homes."/><meta property="og:title" content="Verb generalization of preschool-aged children, experimental data 2018-2019"/><meta property="og:description" content="This study investigated whether seeing iconic gestures depicting verb referents promotes two types of generalization.

generalization of preschool-aged children, experimental data 2018-2019\",\"description\":\"This study investigated whether seeing iconic gestures depicting verb referents promotes two types of generalization. We taught 3-4-year-olds novel locomotion verbs. Children who saw iconic manner gestures during training generalized more verbs to novel events (first-order generalization) than children who saw interactive gestures (Exp. 1, N = 48; Exp. 2, N = 48) and path-tracing gestures (Exp. 3, N = 48). Furthermore, immediately (Exp. 1 \u0026 3) and after one week (Exp. 2), the iconic manner gesture group outperformed the control groups in subsequent generalization trials with different novel verbs (second-order generalization), although all groups saw interactive gestures. Thus, seeing iconic gestures that depict verb referents helps children (1) generalize individual verb meanings to novel events and (2) learn more verbs from the same sub-category. People naturally produce gestures when they speak. Little is still known about the role these gestures play in children's language development. My research focused on the role of iconic gestures - gesticulations that accompany speech and illustrate what is being said. For instance, you can wiggle your index and middle fingers to depict \\\"walking\\\" or bring your hand to your mouth as if holding a glass to depict \\\"drinking\\\". Children understand these iconic gestures by age 3 and my PhD research suggested that seeing adults produce these gestures while speaking is formative for children's language learning. Studying the ways we can stimulate vocabulary growth in preschool-aged children is very important, because the vocabulary size and skills of children at this age are major predictors of later school success.\\nDuring the fellowship, I will collect data from one experiment with 3-year-old children that will help us to better understand how seeing iconic gestures facilitates word learning. I will visit local nurseries to play a computer-based word learning game with 96 children. I will publish my research findings from this experiment and from my PhD dissertation in two top-tier scientific journals in developmental psychology and I will present those research findings at one international conference on cognitive development, in Budapest, Hungary.\\nI will also develop a Leverhulme Postdoctoral Fellowship proposal that extends my PhD research. I will design a series of lab-based experiments that help us investigate how parents can use nonverbal communication (e.g. facial expressions, body language, and hand gestures) to teach their child new words. I will propose to analyse body position of the parent and child (face-to-face or side-by-side) and eye contact, touch, and gestures. \\nMoreover, I will visit two internationally leading research groups to develop collaborative research on mother-child interactions.
