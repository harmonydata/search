2d:Tf0b,The purpose of this survey was to provide information relevant to planning for rural Hampshire, including residents' attitudes to environment, housing experience, mobility, economic and family experience and history, and spare time activities, plus information on visitors to villages. A second study, <i>Town Life in Hampshire, 1965</i> is held at the Data Archive under SN:65007.  Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions
General attitudes towards the village include: whether village could be described as friendly (5-point scale), whether new people fit in easily (4-point scale), improvements respondent would like to see made to village (e.g. bus service, shops, sanitation etc.), what respondent would like to see preserved (e.g village square, 'olde worlde' aspects), whether respondent would favour additions such as a public swimming bath - if this was dependent only on more people moving into village, whether a need for more jobs in village is perceived; on balance, whether village life is preferable to town life - reason for answer is given.
Specific attitudes on housing include: whether sufficient housing available, whether satisfactory and well built, whether too expensive, whether more council houses are needed. If respondent believes that too many houses are being built, he is asked what affect he believes it will have on the village (8 categories). A record is made of properties bought or rented by people coming into the village from outside.
Information on geographical mobility includes: whether respondent or member of household can drive, motor vehicle ownership or use, whether respondent goes out of village (i.e. at least one mile out) to work, shop, visit friends and relations or for pleasure and recreation; if so, how often, and location of visit (i.e. nearby town, London conurbation - 7 categories), distance travelled for each of above activities is given, and when last went out of village (if yesterday - number of times that day are recorded together with purpose and destination), transport used to go out of village (6 categories), length and time of journey. Finally whether respondent's mobility pattern - in his own estimation - has changed over last 5 years.
Information on respondent's spare time activities includes: affiliation to clubs, institutes, societies, associations etc. in the village (with proportion of their members coming from outside village), whether respondent belongs to any organisations outside village (location recorded), events that take place in village in addition to those run by organisations mentioned, whether respondent attends church or chapel (frequency of attendance over past year, location of church/chapel recorded), whether respondent frequents a public house (if so, how often and location given).
Residents: length of residency in village, whether moved into new house, reason for coming to village - particularly whether for retirement - previous place of residency. Data are given for respondent's parents and any children of 16 years + (i.e. reason for leaving village etc.), whether plans to move from present house, if so, to where; perception of normal length of residency in village is recorded.
Visitors to village: place of residency, distance from village of survey administration, reason for and purpose of visit to this village, frequency of visits and time of year usually visits recorded.
