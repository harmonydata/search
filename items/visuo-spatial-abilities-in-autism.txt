17:T140b,{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Visuo-spatial abilities in autism","description":"Experimental data to test the theory that individuals with autism rely less on top-down processing. The influence of knowledge on perception was explored on two different levels. Firstly, we examined the encoding or input of information in those with and without autism. A second level in which the influence of top-down processing was explored is related to the output of knowledge. Three studies were carried out to investigate whether higher-level knowledge interferes with the ability to perceive a stimulus accurately in those with autism as it does in those with typical development. Autism is a developmental disorder that afflicts at least 1 child per ten-thousand, and perhaps as many as 1 in one-thousand. There is currently an increasing rate of diagnosis for reasons unknown. There is no cure, and afflicted individuals are destined to live with the disorder indefinitely, though with suitable programmes of intervention, individuals can adapt somewhat. The disorder is diagnosed according to behavioural criteria and impairments are apparent in communication, socialisation and imagination. Many individuals with autism also have associated learning difficulties, though some are high functioning and may even have measured intelligence that is higher than the population average. Autism in these individuals might be referred to as Asperger syndrome. Despite the impairments in autism, another characteristic is relatively heightened visuo-spatial abilities. Frith explains this paradox by suggesting that individuals with autism have weak central coherence, meaning that they tend to process piece-meal rather than holistically. So, for example, individuals with autism have an aptitude for detecting a small shape embedded in a larger figure. Whereas individuals without autism are hampered by their apprehension of the overall figure, those with autism readily process the stimulus in its constituent parts. Relatedly, it seems individuals without autism bring their conceptual knowledge to bear on encoding and reproduction (e.g. as in their drawings) of a stimulus, while those with autism perhaps are not so influenced by conceptual knowledge and are thus equipped to reproduce the stimulus more faithfully. The purpose of the proposed research is to conduct 4 systematic investigations into the encoding and the output of information in individuals with autism to establish the following. (1) Are they more effective in encoding visual than verbal input, as commensurate with their generally heightened visuo-spatial abilities? (2) Are their depictions faithful because they are not hampered by conceptual knowledge? In the first investigation, individuals with autism will be presented with a list either in words or pictures, either in the presence or absence of a theme cue that links the items. We expect those with autism to be better at recalling pictures than words and indeed to recall more of the pictorial information than comparison participants. We expect their recall of pictures to be so good, that the theme cue contributes no further help to retrieval, unlike in comparison participants. In the second, third and fourth investigations, we expect depictions made by individuals without autism to by contaminated by conceptual knowledge. We expect them to import material in some cases, while in other cases, we expect them to distort the shapes of presented stimuli. In other words, we expect the depictions to approximate towards what participants know about the presented objects. We expect the effect to increase, as the presented stimuli become more easily recognisable and classifiable as particular objects (Experiment 3). In contrast, we expect individuals with autism generally to depict the stimuli more accurately and we expect the recognisability of the stimulus object not to have such a marked effect in distorting depiction. The findings will tell us at least two things. They will tell us about the benefits of visually-based information for individuals with autism. For example, perhaps individuals with autism will be better at encoding and retaining material presented in pictures rather than words. The findings will also tell us about the autistic aptitude for faithful depiction, and especially its cognitive basis. Armed with this new knowledge, it will be possible to design programmes of curricula, intervention and therapy that are more closely suited to autistic cognitive characteristics. The findings will inform the construction of virtual environments for individuals with autism, in a project currently funded by the Shirley Foundation. In summary, the project will generate novel findings that are publishable in front-line journals, and it will also serve strategically to inform the applied work in the Shirley project","url":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/visuo-spatial-abilities-in-autism","identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-852632"],"keywords":["AUTISM","EXPERIMENT","INFORMATION"],"temporalCoverage":"2002-02-01/2003-01-31"}c:["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":[["$","$L16",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$17"}}],"$L18"]}]

Relatedly, it seems individuals without autism bring their conceptual knowledge to bear on encoding and reproduction (e.g. as in their drawings) of a stimulus, while those with autism perhaps are not so influenced by conceptual knowledge and are thus equipped to reproduce the stimulus more faithfully. The purpose of the proposed research is to conduct 4 systematic investigations into the encoding and the output of information in individuals with autism to establish the following. (1) Are they more effective in encoding visual than verbal input, as commensurate with their generally heightened visuo-spatial abilities? (2) Are their depictions faithful because they are not hampered by conceptual knowledge? In the first investigation, individuals with autism will be presented with a list either in words or pictures, either in the presence or absence of a theme cue that links the items. We expect those with autism to be better at recalling pictures than words and indeed to recall more of the pictorial information than comparison participants. We expect their recall of pictures to be so good, that the theme cue contributes no further help to retrieval, unlike in comparison participants. In the second, third and fourth investigations, we expect depictions made by individuals without autism to by contaminated by conceptual knowledge. We expect them to import material in some cases, while in other cases, we expect them to distort the shapes of presented stimuli. In other words, we expect the depictions to approximate towards what participants know about the presented objects. We expect the effect to increase, as the presented stimuli become more easily recognisable and classifiable as particular objects (Experiment 3). In contrast, we expect individuals with autism generally to depict the stimuli more accurately and we expect the recognisability of the stimulus object not to have such a marked effect in distorting depiction. The findings will tell us at least two things. They will tell us about the benefits of visually-based information for individuals with autism. For example, perhaps individuals with autism will be better at encoding and retaining material presented in pictures rather than words. The findings will also tell us about the autistic aptitude for faithful depiction, and especially its cognitive basis. Armed with this new knowledge, it will be possible to design programmes of curricula, intervention and therapy that are more closely suited to autistic cognitive characteristics. The findings will inform the construction of virtual environments for individuals with autism, in a project currently funded by the Shirley Foundation. In summary, the project will generate novel findings that are publishable in front-line journals, and it will also serve strategically to inform the applied work in the Shirley project1d:["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:description","content":"$2c"}]

2d:T12b4,Experimental data to test the theory that individuals with autism rely less on top-down processing. The influence of knowledge on perception was explored on two different levels. Firstly, we examined the encoding or input of information in those with and without autism. A second level in which the influence of top-down processing was explored is related to the output of knowledge. Three studies were carried out to investigate whether higher-level knowledge interferes with the ability to perceive a stimulus accurately in those with autism as it does in those with typical development. Autism is a developmental disorder that afflicts at least 1 child per ten-thousand, and perhaps as many as 1 in one-thousand. There is currently an increasing rate of diagnosis for reasons unknown. There is no cure, and afflicted individuals are destined to live with the disorder indefinitely, though with suitable programmes of intervention, individuals can adapt somewhat. The disorder is diagnosed according to behavioural criteria and impairments are apparent in communication, socialisation and imagination. Many individuals with autism also have associated learning difficulties, though some are high functioning and may even have measured intelligence that is higher than the population average. Autism in these individuals might be referred to as Asperger syndrome. Despite the impairments in autism, another characteristic is relatively heightened visuo-spatial abilities. Frith explains this paradox by suggesting that individuals with autism have weak central coherence, meaning that they tend to process piece-meal rather than holistically. So, for example, individuals with autism have an aptitude for detecting a small shape embedded in a larger figure.
