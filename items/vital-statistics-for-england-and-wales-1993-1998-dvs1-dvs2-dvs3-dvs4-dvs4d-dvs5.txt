During 2006, Sam Smith and colleagues at ESDS Government carried out work on various studies in the series prior to 2002, to improve the data format. The resulting files have been redeposited at the UKDA. More information is available in the documentation for the studies concerned.

 The data cover mainly local and health authority level data for 1993-1998: births and deaths summary data (1994-1998), births data, mortality data by cause, infant and perinatal mortality data. Some data at ward level are also included: births and deaths by wards (1995-1998) and deaths by selected causes by wards (1995-1998).

For the second edition (August 2006), work was carried out on the data by ESDS Government (see above), in order to produce more user-friendly tab-delimited ASCII files. The data are also available in Excel, and ONS ITELite format.
