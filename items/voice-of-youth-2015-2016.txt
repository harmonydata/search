The national evaluation included a postal survey of young people who registered interest in NCS, including those who took part and a comparison group of those who registered interest but ultimately did not take part.

This was designed to produce a non-equivalent control-group design study. The secondary purpose for which the data was collected was to explore, among a nationally-representative sample of young people, the relationships between the schools young people go to, and the neighbourhoods in which they live, and their dynamics of inter-group relations and wider social cohesion.
