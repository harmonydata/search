It also explored ways in which the inclusion and participation of bereaved people in the process can be better supported. The core component of the research involved interviews with 89 individuals who had come into contact with the coroner service following the death of someone they were close to. The researchers also interviewed 82 coronial professionals (including coroners, coroners’ officers, lawyers and others) and 19 individuals who had given evidence to an inquest in a professional capacity or supported colleagues who were witnesses. This constitutes the largest ever empirical study of lay and professional experiences of the coronial process in England and Wales.
