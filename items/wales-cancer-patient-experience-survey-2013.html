The survey is congruent with the Welsh Government&#x27;s &#x27;Together For Health: Cancer Delivery Plan for the NHS 2016&#x27; and measures progress from the patient&#x27;s point of view against the objectives of the Cancer  Delivery  Plan.  The  CPES  provides  information  which  can  be  used  to  drive  local  quality improvements, both by Health Boards/Trust and by planners, and is consistent with the objectives of NHS policy in Wales. A total of 10,945 patients who had received treatment for cancer from seven NHS Health Boards/Trusts were included in the sample for the Wales Cancer Patient Experience Survey. These patients fell into 13 different cancer groups. 

The survey included all adult patients (aged 16 and over) with a primary diagnosis of cancer in the first diagnosis field, who had been admitted to an NHS hospital as an inpatient or as a day case patient, and had been in active treatment between 1 June 2012 and 30 March 2013. Data definitions identifying patients qualifying for inclusion were based on the ICD10 codes of C00-C99, and D05 being used. Patients with an ICD10 code of C44 (other malignant neoplasms of the skin), and C84 (some Haematology codes) were excluded from the sample by agreement. There are only very small numbers of such patients with these codes. 

The response rate was  69%, with 7,352 patients responding. The survey instrument and methodology is closely aligned to the CPES in England, conducted in 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014 (the English CPES series is held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33454).

Further information may be found on the Quality Health website.

 The survey explored the experience of cancer patients in Wales, as part of a series of studies, covering issues such as: speed of admission to specialist cancer services; information provided on tests, types of cancer, operations, support groups and financial support to the patient; assessment of quality of service given by doctors, nurses, and Cancer Clinical Nurse Specialists; and quality of support given to patients by primary and community health services."/><meta property="og:title" content="Wales Cancer Patient Experience Survey, 2013"/><meta property="og:description" content="The Wales Cancer Patient Experience Survey, 2013 (CPES) is designed to monitor national progress on cancer care.
