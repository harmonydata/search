The occupations classifications are based on two schemes:

Industrial Classification

The industrial classification used is the Booth-Armstrong classification which was developed in the 1880s by Charles Booth and modified by W.A. Armstrong.

Social Class Classification

The social class classification used is based on the Registrar General's <i>Classification of Occupations:1951</i> and uses the  modifications suggested by W.A. Armstrong.
