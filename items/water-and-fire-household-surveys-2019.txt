Responses were recorded from approximately 200 adults representing their households in each site. Due to the Covid-19 restrictions in place at the time, survey data was collected via telephone/digital device interviews. All interviews were undertaken in the language of the respondent’s choice – generally isiXhosa, Afrikaans or English. Responses have been translated into English to produce this final data set.\nThe survey was organised in two parts: Section One recorded mainly demographic and macro-level quantitative data.

The scale of this challenge is heightened by migration to cities, and rapid, extensive growth of formal and informal settlements, which are extremely susceptible to environmental risks. Climate change has exacerbated the risk of disasters as destructive events and episodes such as flood, drought and fire have increased in severity and frequency.
