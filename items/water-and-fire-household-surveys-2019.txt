The surveys focused on household experiences of and responses to episodes of flooding (Sweet Home Farm); water scarcity (Delft South); and runaway fires (Overcome Heights). Responses were recorded from approximately 200 adults representing their households in each site. Due to the Covid-19 restrictions in place at the time, survey data was collected via telephone/digital device interviews. All interviews were undertaken in the language of the respondent’s choice – generally isiXhosa, Afrikaans or English. Responses have been translated into English to produce this final data set.\nThe survey was organised in two parts: Section One recorded mainly demographic and macro-level quantitative data. Section Two focused on respondent disaster and resilience experiences and included both quantitative and open-ended, qualitative responses.Water and Fire explored the experiences of and responses of residents in the Cape Flat region of South Africa to episodes of flooding, water scarcity and fire. South Africa's township residents are beset with legacy economic and social challenges of apartheid, poverty, and constrained development opportunities. The scale of this challenge is heightened by migration to cities, and rapid, extensive growth of formal and informal settlements, which are extremely susceptible to environmental risks. Climate change has exacerbated the risk of disasters as destructive events and episodes such as flood, drought and fire have increased in severity and frequency. The project worked with residents in three townships of varying levels of informality to find out about people’s experiences of each of these hazards: Sweet Home Farm (floods), Delft (water scarcity) and Overcome Heights (fires).\n\nThe project team worked with locally-based co-researchers with the aim of developing a set of community-driven resilience actions – the ‘Best Bets’ of the project title.
