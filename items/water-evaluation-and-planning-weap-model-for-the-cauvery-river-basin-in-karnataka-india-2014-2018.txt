We have also secured £28 million in leveraged funding.
Extensive consultations have highlighted the need to address the financial crisis/downturn, the continuing absence of a comprehensive international climate treaty, and recent controversies on climate science. They have stressed the need for more integrated approaches to climate research, to continue making a distinctive contribution in the context of other climate research, and to contribute to ESRC Strategic Priorities. 
Our five research themes for Phase Two are:
1. Understanding green growth and climate-compatible development: what could constitute green growth or climate-compatible development in industrialised and developing countries?
2. Advancing climate finance and investment: how can we unlock major flows of finance into both adaptation and mitigation in different contexts? What are the implications of such flows?
3. Evaluating the performance of climate policies: how can we assess the performance of different climate policies and how can we understand the scope for policy learning?
4. Managing climate risks and uncertainties and strengthening climate services: how can we promote new approaches to the assessment, management and communication of climate risks/uncertainties?
5. Enabling rapid transitions in mitigation and adaptation: how can we understand the scope for rapid transitions to dramatically cut emissions and adapt to significant climate change?
Beyond the planned scientific programme, we propose to a CCCEP Innovation Fund with the aim of stimulating, developing and disseminating innovative ideas from both the academic and practitioner communities.
Our plans for Phase Two build on the solid institutional foundations of Phase One, including CCCEP's position at LSE/Leeds, its management structure and its key staff. However, we also plan to refresh the team. We will continue to engage with key stakeholders throughout the research process and to exploit a range of pathways to impact.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Water evaluation and planning (WEAP) model for the Cauvery river basin in Karnataka, India 2014-2018"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Water evaluation and planning (WEAP) model for the Cauvery river basin in Karnataka, India 2014-2018"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/water-evaluation-and-planning-weap-model-for-the-cauvery-river-basin-in-karnataka-india-2014-2018"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Water evaluation and planning (WEAP) model for the Cauvery river basin in Karnataka, India 2014-2018"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Water evaluation and planning (WEAP) model for the Cauvery river basin in Karnataka, India 2014-2018"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
