This information includes details such as the schools or colleges you've attended, the courses you've studied and the qualifications you've gained as well as other characteristics such as attendance, suspensions or exclusions, whether you have/had a special educational need, or have ever been eligible for free school meals. We would like to add this information to your survey answers. This will create a more accurate picture of your life and experiences, and will be used for research and statistical purposes only. It will be kept confidential and names and addresses are never included in the results. No individual can be identified in reports. We would like to link in information about your education to your survey responses on a yearly basis. To do this we need your permission to pass the minimum amount of your personal details (your full name, gender, date of birth and full address) to The Department for Education {if SCHOOLCNTRY = 1} / the Education Analytical Services {if SCHOOLCNTRY = 2} / The Department for Education and Skills {if SCHOOLCNTRY = 3} / The Department of Education and the Education and Skills Authority {if SCHOOLCNTRY = 4} so they can identify your individual education record. They will then create a link between this record and your survey responses before making your records anonymous. The education record will be placed on a secure website so that researchers can use it for research and statistical purposes.

Your answers are of great value and interest to many academic and social policy researchers who will make good use of them. We would like to add records held by the Department for Work and Pensions {if region = England/Scotland/Wales} / Social Security Agency {if region = Northern Ireland}, containing information they hold on your benefit claims and time on employment programs, to the responses you have given to this study.
