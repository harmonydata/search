The Round 7 Wave 1 Variable Catalogue Excel file has also been updated. The WAS questionnaire was divided into two parts with all adults aged 16 years and over (excluding those aged 16 to 18 currently in full-time education) being interviewed in each responding household.17:T1267,The Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS) is a longitudinal survey, which aims to address gaps identified in data about the economic well-being of households by gathering information on level of assets, savings and debt; saving for retirement; how wealth is distributed among households or individuals; and factors that affect financial planning. Private households in Great Britain were sampled for the survey (meaning that people in residential institutions, such as retirement homes, nursing homes, prisons, barracks or university halls of residence, and also homeless people were not included).The WAS commenced in July 2006, with a first wave of interviews carried out over two years, to June 2008. Interviews were achieved with 30,595 households at Wave 1. Those households were approached again for a Wave 2 interview between July 2008 and June 2010, and 20,170 households took part. Wave 3 covered July 2010 - June 2012, Wave 4 covered July 2012 - June 2014 and Wave 5 covered July 2014 - June 2016. Revisions to previous waves' data mean that small differences may occur between originally published estimates and estimates from the datasets held by the UK Data Service. These revisions are due to improvements in the imputation methodology.Note from the WAS team - November 2023:"The Office for National Statistics has identified a very small number of outlier cases present in the seventh round of the Wealth and Assets Survey covering the period April 2018 to March 2020. Our current approach is to treat cases where we have reasonable evidence to suggest the values provided for specific variables are outliers. This approach did not occur for two individuals for several variables involved in the estimation of their pension wealth. While we estimate any impacts are very small overall and median pension wealth and median total wealth estimates are unaffected, this will affect the accuracy of the breakdowns of the pension wealth within the wealthiest decile, and data derived from them. We are urging caution in the interpretation of more detailed estimates."Survey Periodicity - "Waves" to "Rounds"Due to the survey periodicity moving from "Waves" (July, ending 
in June two years later) to “Rounds” (April, ending in March two years 
later), interviews using the ‘Wave 6’ questionnaire started in July 2016
 and were conducted for 21 months, finishing in March 2018. Data for 
round 6 covers the period April 2016 to March 2018. This comprises of 
the last three months of Wave 5 (April to June 2016) and 21 months of 
Wave 6 (July 2016 to March 2018). Round 5 and Round 6 datasets are based
 on a mixture of original wave-based datasets. Each wave of the survey 
has a unique questionnaire and therefore each of these round-based 
datasets are based on two questionnaires. While there may be some 
changes in the questionnaires, the derived variables for the key wealth 
estimates have not changed over this period. The aim is to collect the 
same data, though in some cases the exact questions asked may differ slightly. Detailed information on Moving the Wealth and Assets Survey onto a financial years’ basis was published on the ONS website in July 2019.Further information and documentation may be found on the ONS Wealth and Assets Survey webpage. Users are advised to the check the page for updates before commencing analysis.Users should note that issues with linking have been reported and the WAS team are currently investigating.Secure Access WAS dataThe Secure Access version of the WAS includes additional, detailed geographical variables not included in the End User Licence (EUL) version (SN 7215). These include:WardsParliamentary Constituency Areas for Wave 1 onlyCensus Output AreasLower Layer Super Output AreasLocal AuthoritiesLocal Education AuthoritiesProspective users of the Secure Access version of the WAS will need to fulfil additional requirements, including completion of face-to-face training, and agreement to the Secure Access User Agreement and Licence Compliance Policy, in order to obtain permission to use that version (see 'Access' section below). Users are therefore strongly encouraged to download the EUL version (SN 7215) to see if it contains sufficient detail for their needs, before considering making an application for the Secure Access version.Latest Edition InformationFor the ninth edition (October 2022), the Round 7 person and household data have been updated.
