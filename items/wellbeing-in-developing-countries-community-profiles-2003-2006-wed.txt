The community profiles were also treated as ‘living documents’ that were constantly updated and modified with additional data as the field work proceeded.
 The community profiles do not follow a consistent format, and therefore vary across the four countries. However they all include details on the following:physical description of the community (locating the site in space)historical background and key events (locating the site in time) people (population and demographics), languages, religion, social settlementmaterial resources (occupation, market, infrastructure, provision of government and non government services) natural resources and land use (water, livestock, forest, wildlife, crops) human resources and processes (education, migration, health) socio-political resources (social and political groups, local institutions, social stratification) cultural resources (traditions and beliefs, religious and non religious events)27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2c"}]
