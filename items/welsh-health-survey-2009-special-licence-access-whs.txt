Differences between the standard access End User Licence version and the Special Licence access version:
The standard access End User Licence WHS does not include unitary authority, strata and PSU as these variables pose a potential risk of disclosure. These variables are included in the Special Licence access versions from 2003/04 onwards. For further information on how to make an application for the Special Licence data, see the ACCESS section.
