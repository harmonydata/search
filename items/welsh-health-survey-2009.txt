For the third edition (April 2014), the adult data file and the user guide have been updated, due to the removal of one respondent's data.

 The main topics covered for adults are health service use, health status, medicines, illnesses and other health problems, and health-related lifestyle (including smoking, alcohol, diet and exercise).

The main topics for children are health status, health service use, accidents, illnesses and other health problems, eating habits, physical activity and strengths and difficulties.e:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Welsh Health Survey, 2009"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$16"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Welsh Health Survey, 2009"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$17"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/welsh-health-survey-2009"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Welsh Health Survey, 2009"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Welsh Health Survey, 2009"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
