2a:T97d,The Welsh Health Survey (WHS) collects information about the health of people living in Wales, the way they use health services, and then things that can affect their health. This dataset covers the tenth year of the current WHS, which ran for 12 months from January 2013.

The current WHS replaced two previous surveys; the former Welsh Health Survey (undertaken in 1995 and 1998) and the former Health in Wales Survey (undertaken every two to three years between 1985 and 1996). Results from this survey are not comparable with those from the previous surveys because of differences in the questionnaires and survey methodology.

The survey is designed to:
Provide national estimates of health and health-related lifestyle;  
Examine differences between population sub-groups and local areas;
Provide evidence to inform and monitor policies and strategies for promoting better health;
Provide data for setting and monitoring targets and indicators; 
Provide local authority level information for development of joint local health, social care and well-being strategies.

The WHS is based on a representative sample of adults aged 16 and over living in private households in Wales. In addition, up to two children aged 0 to 15 were randomly selected from each household.

Data for WHS 2003-04, WHS 2004-05, WHS 2005-06, WHS 2007, WHS 2008, WHS 2009, WHS 2010, WHS 2011 and WHS 2012 are also deposited with the Data Archive (SN 5692, 5693, 5750, 6052, 6372, 6589, 6895, 7188 and 7459).

There are also Special Licence datasets, with Local Authority, for several survey years. WHS 2009 (SN 7486), WHS 2010 (SN 7487), WHS 2011 (SN 7488) and WHS 2012 (SN 7489) have Special Licence datasets deposited with the Data Archive.

Further information about the WHS, including links to publications, may be found on the Welsh Government's Welsh Health Survey web pages.

The Special Licence version of the WHS 2013 is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 7633. The main topics covered for adults are: 
general health and wellbeing; health service use; medicines and illnesses; untreated problems or symptoms; alcohol consumption and smoking; fruit and vegetable consumption; exercise; carers; height and weight; demographics; infant feeding.

The main topics covered for children are: 
health status; health service use; accidents; illnesses and other health problems; eating habits; physical activity and strengths and difficulties (SDQ).26:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2a"}]
