Set up in 1986, the study was designed to investigate the differences in health by socio-economic circumstances, gender, the place where people live, age, ethnic group and family type. Through tracking three cohorts of volunteers, each born roughly twenty years apart, the study provides data at critical points in the lifespan, as participants make the transition from adolescence to working life; through the main part of working life; and from working life to retirement. Additionally, the study was designed to explore the effect of the historical context of people’s lives on their health and circumstances by comparing the different cohorts at the same age at different points in time.","url":"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/items/west-of-scotland-twenty-07","keywords":["Biomarkers","Cognitive measures","Diet and nutrition","Education","Housing","Socioeconomic

twenty years. Set up in 1986, the study was designed to investigate the differences in health by socio-economic circumstances, gender, the place where people live, age, ethnic group and family type. Through tracking three cohorts of volunteers, each born roughly twenty years apart, the study provides data at critical points in the lifespan, as participants make the transition from adolescence to working life; through the main part of working life; and from working life to retirement. Additionally, the study was designed to explore the effect of the historical context of people’s lives on their health and circumstances by comparing the different cohorts at the same age at different points in time.","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/WOS.png","publisher":{"name":"MRC Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, University of

West of Scotland Twenty-07 Study is a longitudinal research project initiated in 1986, focusing on the health and socio-economic conditions of individuals in the West of Scotland. It involves three cohorts of participants, each born approximately twenty years apart, allowing for the examination of health trajectories across different life stages: adolescence to working life, the main working years, and the transition to retirement. The study aims to understand how socio-economic status, gender, geographic location, age, ethnicity, and family structure influence health outcomes. By comparing these cohorts at similar ages but different historical periods, the study also investigates the impact of historical and social changes on health. This comprehensive approach provides valuable insights into the interplay between socio-economic factors and health over time, contributing to public health policy and socio-economic research."}}]]
