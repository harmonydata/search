 Study One is an exploratory recall study in which 62 working people were asked to think about critical fairness-related incidents from their own experience in the workplace, and then to fill in a questionnaire regarding this incident. The incidents concerned experiences of unfairness at work from distant or close managers or peers. 

Study Two is a questionnaire study that aimed to develop a measure of individual differences in preferences for fairness norms. A larger set of items developed by a group of experts was administered to 338 working people.  

The purpose of Study Three was to extend and generalise the findings from studies one and two. The researchers administered a questionnaire about fairness experiences with managers and peers to the alumni of a UK university (n=458). This study included several fairness norms, as well as measures of friendship and trust, and the individual difference measure that we developed about fairness preferences in Study Two.28:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2c"}]
