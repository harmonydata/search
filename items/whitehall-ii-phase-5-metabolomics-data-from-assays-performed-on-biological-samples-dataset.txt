These are in addition to the contribution of unhealthy behaviours and traditional risk factors (such as high blood pressure).\nBy combining over 30 years of data on social inequalities and chronic disease with new clinical measures of cognitive function, mental disorders and physical functioning, the Whitehall II study has become a world-class, interdisciplinary study of ageing, allowing research on multi-morbidity, functional decline, frailty, disability, and dementia.\n\nStudy website: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/whitehallII","url":["https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.whitehall2/2764a197-ab56-4cc6-aca8-2072cd9a0685","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=Whitehall","https://www.ucl.ac.uk/epidemiology-health-care/research/epidemiology-and-public-health/research/whitehall-ii","https://healthdatagateway.org/en/dataset/1150"],"keywords":["Reproductive health","Biomarkers","Diet and nutrition","Cognitive measures","Neighbourhood","Housing","Victimisation and life events","Sleep problems","Parenting and family","Loneliness and social isolation","Work and employment","Social care - receipt","Social care - provision","Social care - need","Digital technology and social media","Cognitive decline","Physical health assessment","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","biological","population","Longterm","lifestyle"],"identifier":["https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyh372","10.48532/048000"],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"CLOSER Discovery","url":"https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.whitehall2/2764a197-ab56-4cc6-aca8-2072cd9a0685","image":"https://closer.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/closer-2022/www/images/closer-logo-full.svg"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=Whitehall","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Health Data Research Innovation Gateway","url":"https://healthdatagateway.org/en/dataset/1150"}],"publisher":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, University College London"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dementia Platform UK"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Professor Mika Kivimaki"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, University College London"}],"funder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"MRC BHF NIA ESRC EU_flag ERC\nNational Heart, Lung & Blood Institute"}],"license":["https://portal.dementiasplatform.uk/Apply"],"image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/Whitehall.png","size":"10308"},"extra_data":{"source":["hdruk","mhc","closer"],"resource_type":"study","study_design":[],"instruments":[],"name":"Whitehall II","country_codes":["GB"],"keywords":["Reproductive health","Biomarkers","Diet and nutrition","Cognitive measures","Neighbourhood","Housing","Victimisation and life events","Sleep problems","Parenting and family","Loneliness and social isolation","Work and employment","Social care - receipt","Social care - provision","Social care - need","Digital technology and social media","Cognitive decline","Physical health assessment","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","biological","population","Longterm","lifestyle"],"uuid":"6c6000797daabc7e5b6e8314f8f6989f","number_of_variables":41},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]}]}}]]
