It involves a cohort of British civil servants and has collected data through self-completion questionnaires and clinical assessments every two to five years. The study has highlighted the role of psychosocial factors, such as work stress and work-family conflict, in the development of heart disease and diabetes, alongside traditional risk factors like high blood pressure and unhealthy behaviors. Over its more than 30-year span, the study has expanded to include new clinical measures of cognitive function, mental disorders, and physical functioning. This has enabled comprehensive research into ageing, focusing on multi-morbidity, functional decline, frailty, disability, and dementia, making it a leading interdisciplinary study in the field."}}]]
