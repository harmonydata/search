We can only accurately identify each stimulus in a set if the set contains fewer than approximately seven members. These sorts of tasks are called absolute identification tasks. For example, we can only identify about five or six stimuli if the stimuli differ only in how bright they are. Further, this limit seems to be common to all of our sensory modalities.
