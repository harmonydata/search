It uses an innovative mix of social network research, ethnography and governance diaries to gain in-depth data to reveal how residents navigate public authority in an insecure environment and cope with unforeseen shocks. The data is collected every two weeks by five Congolese researchers over a period of eleven months. Project leads will analyse the data using complementary qualitative and quantitative approaches, yielding a range of outputs from co-authored academic articles to policy briefs and blogs written by researchers. A paper examining the political economy of water services in Goma will also be researched and written in mid-2019. This anonymised data concerns the household financial diaries of 23 households in three neighbourhoods of Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) between February 2019 and March 2020. Our research centred on man- and woman-headed households of low and middle socioeconomic strata. It is designed to be used alongside ethnographic interview and social network data which was also collected but is not in this repository due to sensitivities.CPAID will address critical questions that have bedevilled the outside world&#x27;s engagement with governance of fragile, conflict affected, marginal and impoverished populations. In these places inclusive growth has proved elusive. We propose a different starting point. Rather than anticipating transitions to accountable and capable Western government familiar to policymakers, CPAID prioritises the everyday lived realities of ordinary people in conflict-affected and fragile situations. In these places, the foundations of such growth are far more widespread and pervasive than state institutions. Through the lens of public authority, CPAID researchers seek to understand how governance actually functions in such circumstances, what forms of growth does this accomplish, and can actually existing forms of inclusive growth be promoted by development practitioners. Only a historically-informed, contextual and interdisciplinary analysis of how political, economic and social factors interact can achieve a full understanding of &#x27;real governance&#x27; in conflict affected in places. Understanding these dynamics is critical to inform new and improved models of international development which will actually provide or enhance firm foundations for future inclusive growth.
CPAID will explore how forms of public authority shape and are shaped by a set of interlocking global challenges that pose both risks and opportunities for international development and inclusive growth: namely, the provision of security and justice; migration, displacement and situations of endemic violence; global health threats; control and allocation of resources; and advances in media and information technologies. CPAID will fill a serious evidence gap about on the ground realities in large areas of Africa which currently affect other regions, including Europe. The CPAID team includes world- leading authorities on, Uganda, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Central African Republic.
Our primary focus is on public authority as perceived, understood and experienced by populations in locations of research. Research over the last decade or so has challenged prevailing assumptions embodied in the &#x27;failed states&#x27; discourse, namely that in the absence of western-style governance institutions, fragile and conflict affected societies collapse or flounder. CPAID will undertake research which can help us understand the various ways in which actual forms of public authority work. This approach is desperately needed in development policy. Conventional conflict and post-conflict state building processes, premised on Weberian notions of the state, are hugely expensive and too often unsuccessful or arguably even counter-productive. Moreover, with the rise of &#x27;resilience thinking&#x27;, donors are increasingly acknowledging that the world is a place of &#x27;radical uncertainty&#x27;, and determined, in the words of DFID to &#x27;embrace uncertainty as an opportunity to... bounce back better&#x27;. This has underpinned a new, but under-researched agenda to find more cost-effective and culturally &#x27;embedded&#x27; forms of governance that donors can support.

water and other basic social services in the city of Goma, in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It uses an innovative mix of social network research, ethnography and governance diaries to gain in-depth data to reveal how residents navigate public authority in an insecure environment and cope with unforeseen shocks. The data is collected every two weeks by five Congolese researchers over a period of eleven months. Project leads will analyse the data using complementary qualitative and quantitative approaches, yielding a range of outputs from co-authored academic articles to policy briefs and blogs written by researchers. A paper examining the political economy of water services in Goma will also be researched and written in mid-2019. This anonymised data concerns the household financial diaries of 23 households in three neighbourhoods of Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) between February 2019 and March 2020. Our research centred on man- and woman-headed households of low and middle socioeconomic strata. It is designed to be used alongside ethnographic interview and social network data which was also collected but is not in this repository due to sensitivities.CPAID will address critical questions that have bedevilled the outside world's engagement with governance of fragile, conflict affected, marginal and impoverished populations. In these places inclusive growth has proved elusive. We propose a different starting point. Rather than anticipating transitions to accountable and capable Western government familiar to policymakers, CPAID prioritises the everyday lived realities of ordinary people in conflict-affected and fragile situations. In these places, the foundations of such growth are far more widespread and pervasive than state institutions. Through the lens of public authority, CPAID researchers seek to understand how governance actually functions in such circumstances, what forms of growth does this accomplish, and can actually existing forms of inclusive growth be promoted by development practitioners. Only a historically-informed, contextual and interdisciplinary analysis of how political, economic and social factors interact can achieve a full understanding of 'real governance' in conflict affected in places. Understanding these dynamics is critical to inform new and improved models of international development which will actually provide or enhance firm foundations for future inclusive growth.\\nCPAID will explore how forms of public authority shape and are shaped by a set of interlocking global challenges that pose both risks and opportunities for international development and inclusive growth: namely, the provision of security and justice; migration, displacement and situations of endemic violence; global health threats; control and allocation of resources; and advances in media and information technologies. CPAID will fill a serious evidence gap about on the ground realities in large areas of Africa which currently affect other regions, including Europe. The CPAID team includes world- leading authorities on, Uganda, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Central African Republic.\\nOur primary focus is on public authority as perceived, understood and experienced by populations in locations of research. Research over the last decade or so has challenged prevailing assumptions embodied in the 'failed states' discourse, namely that in the absence of western-style governance institutions, fragile and conflict affected societies collapse or flounder. CPAID will undertake research which can help us understand the various ways in which actual forms of public authority work. This approach is desperately needed in development policy. Conventional conflict and post-conflict state building processes, premised on Weberian notions of the state, are hugely expensive and too often unsuccessful or arguably even counter-productive. Moreover, with the rise of 'resilience thinking', donors are increasingly acknowledging that the world is a place of 'radical uncertainty', and determined, in the words of DFID to 'embrace uncertainty as an opportunity to... bounce back better'.
