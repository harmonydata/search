The aim was to explore how the three approaches could be used to inform each other: for the econometric analysis to build on the qualitative findings, and for policy simulation to take account of within household inequalities beyond those of income, identified by the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The key research questions include: What are the policy-relevant gender specific parameters that affect the distribution of power, entitlements to and use of resources within households in the UK? In particular, do perceptions about entitlements and intra-household distribution of resources depend on the source and recipient of income? How do current and potential policy changes affecting access to different sources of income impact on gender roles and relationships within households? What ambiguities and tensions arise in attempting to improve both the distribution of resources between households and women&#x27;s access to resources within the household? What lessons can be drawn from the above for developing policies that improve women&#x27;s financial autonomy?The project aimed to explore alternative approaches to understanding the behavioral and distributional impact of policy change which take account of gender inequalities in power and influence within the household, and to use such approaches to analyse the effects of changes in fiscal, social security and associated labour market policies in the UK.

The aim was to explore how the three approaches could be used to inform each other: for the econometric analysis to build on the qualitative findings, and for policy simulation to take account of within household inequalities beyond those of income, identified by the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The key research questions include: What are the policy-relevant gender specific parameters that affect the distribution of power, entitlements to and use of resources within households in the UK? In particular, do perceptions about entitlements and intra-household distribution of resources depend on the source and recipient of income? How do current and potential policy changes affecting access to different sources of income impact on gender roles and relationships within households? What ambiguities and tensions arise in attempting to improve both the distribution of resources between households and women's access to resources within the household? What lessons can be drawn from the above for developing policies that improve women's financial autonomy?The project aimed to explore alternative approaches to understanding the behavioral and distributional impact of policy change which take account of gender inequalities in power and influence within the household, and to use such approaches to analyse the effects of changes in fiscal, social security and associated labour market policies in the UK.
