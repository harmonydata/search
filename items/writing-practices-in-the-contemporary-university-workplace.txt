Academic writing practices of various kinds (scholarly, pedagogic, and 'impact' writing) are central to the enterprise of higher education. It is largely through these writing practices that universities achieve their central objectives, against which the success of different institutions is measured.

Socio-material theory articulates the importance of both people and material artefacts in networks of activity. This approach identifies the trajectories of texts, how they circulate and co-ordinate activities across multiple sites; and reveals the underlying physical and information architecture of contemporary practices.
Combining these approaches led us to analyse elements of the everyday experience and activities of participants including: social networks and relationships; the purposes for academic writing and the location of these within the dynamics of other competing purposes and types of writing; resources and tools including digital and other technologies and library/learning resources; the distribution of academic activities across space and time; and disciplinary and institutional domains including activities of research, teaching, administration, consultancy and service.28:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2d"}]
