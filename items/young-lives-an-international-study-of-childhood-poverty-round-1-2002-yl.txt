In addition, several files are included at lower levels (i.e. where there are several records per household). These include the household roster and activity schedules for livelihoods.

Topics covered include: community characteristics (environmental, social and economic); household composition; child health; caregiver background; livelihoods; economic changes; socio-economic status; social capital and anthropometry. In addition, the information gathered for younger children also includes details from the caregiver on pregnancy, delivery, breastfeeding, mental health, and child care. Topics specific to the older 8-year-olds survey include child's schooling and work; child mental health (not available for Peru or Ethiopia), and child development. 

Also included are calculated indices such as a wealth index, various social capital scores, and mental health scores, which are all detailed in the documentation. The SPSS syntax code and/or Stata 'do' files that show methods of calculation for the composite indices are also included in the dataset.

Child development for the 8-year-olds was measured through use of: 
Ravens, J.C. (1988) Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices, Oxford: Harcourt Assessment.18:Tebf,The Young Lives survey is an innovative long-term project investigating the changing nature of childhood poverty in four developing countries. The study is being conducted in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam and has tracked the lives of 12,000 children over a 20-year period, through 5 (in-person) survey rounds (Round 1-5) and, with the latest survey round (Round 6) conducted over the phone in 2020 and 2021 as part of the Listening to Young Lives at Work: COVID-19 Phone Survey.Round 1 of Young Lives surveyed two groups of children in each country, at 1 year old and 5 years old. Round 2 returned to the same children who were then aged 5 and 12 years old. Round 3 surveyed the same children again at aged 7-8 years and 14-15 years, Round 4 surveyed them at 12 and 19 years old, and Round 5 surveyed them at 15 and 22 years old. Thus the younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children through into adulthood, when some will become parents themselves.The 2020 phone survey consists of three phone calls (Call 1 administered in June-July 2020; Call 2 in August-October 2020 and Call 3 in November-December 2020) and the 2021 phone survey consists of two additional phone calls (Call 4 in August 2021 and Call 5 in October-December 2021) The calls took place with each Young Lives respondent, across both the younger and older cohort, and in all four study countries (reaching an estimated total of around 11,000 young people).The Young Lives survey is carried out by teams of local researchers, supported by the Principal Investigator and Data Manager in each country.Further information about the survey, including publications, can be downloaded from the Young Lives website.

 This study includes data and documentation for Round 1 only. Round 2 is available under SN 6852, Round 3 under SN 6853, Round 4 under SN 7931 and Round 5 under SN 8357.Latest edition:For the seventh edition (August 2022), the Peruvian younger cohort data file (pechildlevel1yrold) has been updated to include the care-giver psycho social well-being variables. The erroneous variable SHIGH has been removed from the Peruvian data for both cohorts (pechildlevel1yrold and pechildlevel8yrold).
 This dataset comprises the baseline household surveys for the main sample of 1-year-old and 8-year-old children. For each country, files are included at the community, household and child level for both ages. The household/child level data for the 8-year old children also include information from the child questionnaire. In addition, several files are included at lower levels (i.e. where there are several records per household). These include the household roster and activity schedules for livelihoods.
