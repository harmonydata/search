The study is being conducted in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam and has tracked the lives of 12,000 children over a 20-year period, through 5 (in-person) survey rounds (Round 1-5) and, with the latest survey round (Round 6) conducted over the phone in 2020 and 2021 as part of the Listening to Young Lives at Work: COVID-19 Phone Survey.Round 1 of Young Lives surveyed two groups of children in each country, at 1 year old and 5 years old. Round 2 returned to the same children who were then aged 5 and 12 years old. Round 3 surveyed the same children again at aged 7-8 years and 14-15 years, Round 4 surveyed them at 12 and 19 years old, and Round 5 surveyed them at 15 and 22 years old. Thus the younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children through into adulthood, when some will become parents themselves.The 2020 phone survey consists of three phone calls (Call 1 administered in June-July 2020; Call 2 in August-October 2020 and Call 3 in November-December 2020) and the 2021 phone survey consists of two additional phone calls (Call 4 in August 2021 and Call 5 in October-December 2021) The calls took place with each Young Lives respondent, across both the younger and older cohort, and in all four study countries (reaching an estimated total of around 11,000 young people).The Young Lives survey is carried out by teams of local researchers, supported by the Principal Investigator and Data Manager in each country.Further information about the survey, including publications, can be downloaded from the Young Lives website.

 This study includes data and documentation for Round 3 only. Round 1 is available under SN 5307, Round 2 under SN 6852, Round 4 under SN 7931 and Round 5 under SN 8357.Latest edition:For the fourth edition (August 2022), the Peruvian household level data files (pe_oc_householdlevel and pe_yc_householdlevel) have been updated to include the mother&#x27;s health variables.
 This dataset comprises the data from the 8-year-olds&#x27; and 15-year-olds&#x27; household surveys and child questionnaires carried out in 2009. For each of the four countries the dataset contains files at the community, household and child level for both ages. In addition there are several files at lower levels (i.e. where there are several records per household). These include the household roster and activity schedules for livelihoods, etc. The Peru community level data includes an additional file with community data covering new communities for children who have migrated.

Topics covered in the dataset include: community characteristics (environmental, social and economic); parental background; household and child education; livelihoods and asset framework; household food and non-food consumption and expenditure; social capital, economic changes and recent life history; socio-economic status; child care, education and activities; child health; anthropometry; caregivers perceptions and attitudes; school and activities, child time use; social networks, social skills and social support; feelings and attitudes; parents and household issues; child development; perception of the future, environment and household wealth.

Also included are calculated indices such as a wealth index, various social capital scores, and mental health scores, which are all detailed in the documentation. The SPSS syntax code and/or Stata &#x27;do&#x27; files that show methods of calculation for the composite indices are also included in the dataset."/><meta property="og:title" content="Young Lives: an International Study of Childhood Poverty: Round 3, 2009"/><meta property="og:description" content="The Young Lives survey is an innovative long-term project investigating the changing nature of childhood poverty in four developing countries.

Lives: an International Study of Childhood Poverty: Round 3, 2009\",\"description\":\"The Young Lives survey is an innovative long-term project investigating the changing nature of childhood poverty in four developing countries. The study is being conducted in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam and has tracked the lives of 12,000 children over a 20-year period, through 5 (in-person) survey rounds (Round 1-5) and, with the latest survey round (Round 6) conducted over the phone in 2020 and 2021 as part of the Listening to Young Lives at Work: COVID-19 Phone Survey.Round 1 of Young Lives surveyed two groups of children in each country, at 1 year old and 5 years old. Round 2 returned to the same children who were then aged 5 and 12 years old. Round 3 surveyed the same children again at aged 7-8 years and 14-15 years, Round 4 surveyed them at 12 and 19 years old, and Round 5 surveyed them at 15 and 22 years old. Thus the younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children through into adulthood, when some will become parents themselves.The 2020 phone survey consists of three phone calls (Call 1 administered in June-July 2020; Call 2 in August-October 2020 and Call 3 in November-December 2020) and the 2021 phone survey consists of two additional phone calls (Call 4 in August 2021 and Call 5 in October-December 2021) The calls took place with each Young Lives respondent, across both the younger and older cohort, and in all four study countries (reaching an estimated total of around 11,000 young people).The Young Lives survey is carried out by teams of local researchers, supported by the Principal Investigator and Data Manager in each country.Further information about the survey, including publications, can be downloaded from the Young Lives website.\\n\\n This study includes data and documentation for Round 3 only. Round 1 is available under SN 5307, Round 2 under SN 6852, Round 4 under SN 7931 and Round 5 under SN 8357.Latest edition:For the fourth edition (August 2022), the Peruvian household level data files (pe_oc_householdlevel and pe_yc_householdlevel) have been updated to include the mother's health variables.\\n This dataset comprises the data from the 8-year-olds' and 15-year-olds' household surveys and child questionnaires carried out in 2009. For each of the four countries the dataset contains files at the community, household and child level for both ages. In addition there are several files at lower levels (i.e. where there are several records per household). These include the household roster and activity schedules for livelihoods, etc. The Peru community level data includes an additional file with community data covering new communities for children who have migrated.\\n\\nTopics covered in the dataset include: community characteristics (environmental, social and economic); parental background; household and child education; livelihoods and asset framework; household food and non-food consumption and expenditure; social capital, economic changes and recent life history; socio-economic status; child care, education and activities; child health; anthropometry; caregivers perceptions and attitudes; school and activities, child time use; social networks, social skills and social support; feelings and attitudes; parents and household issues; child development; perception of the future, environment and household wealth.\\n\\nAlso included are calculated indices such as a wealth index, various social capital scores, and mental health scores, which are all detailed in the documentation.
