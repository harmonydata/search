For each of the four countries the dataset contains files at the community, household and child level for both ages. In addition there are several files at lower levels (i.e. where there are several records per household). These include the household roster and activity schedules for livelihoods, etc. The Peru community level data includes an additional file with community data covering new communities for children who have migrated.

Topics covered in the dataset include: community characteristics (environmental, social and economic); parental background; household and child education; livelihoods and asset framework; household food and non-food consumption and expenditure; social capital, economic changes and recent life history; socio-economic status; child care, education and activities; child health; anthropometry; caregivers perceptions and attitudes; school and activities, child time use; social networks, social skills and social support; feelings and attitudes; parents and household issues; child development; perception of the future, environment and household wealth.

Also included are calculated indices such as a wealth index, various social capital scores, and mental health scores, which are all detailed in the documentation.
