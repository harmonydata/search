The study is being conducted in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam and has tracked the lives of 12,000 children over a 20-year period, through 5 (in-person) survey rounds (Round 1-5) and, with the latest survey round (Round 6) conducted over the phone in 2020 and 2021 as part of the Listening to Young Lives at Work: COVID-19 Phone Survey.Round 1 of Young Lives surveyed two groups of children in each country, at 1 year old and 5 years old. Round 2 returned to the same children who were then aged 5 and 12 years old. Round 3 surveyed the same children again at aged 7-8 years and 14-15 years, Round 4 surveyed them at 12 and 19 years old, and Round 5 surveyed them at 15 and 22 years old. Thus the younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children through into adulthood, when some will become parents themselves.The 2020 phone survey consists of three phone calls (Call 1 administered in June-July 2020; Call 2 in August-October 2020 and Call 3 in November-December 2020) and the 2021 phone survey consists of two additional phone calls (Call 4 in August 2021 and Call 5 in October-December 2021) The calls took place with each Young Lives respondent, across both the younger and older cohort, and in all four study countries (reaching an estimated total of around 11,000 young people).The Young Lives survey is carried out by teams of local researchers, supported by the Principal Investigator and Data Manager in each country.Further information about the survey, including publications, can be downloaded from the Young Lives website.

This study includes data and documentation for Round 4 only. Round 1 is available under SN 5307, Round 2 under SN 6852, Round 3 under SN 6853 and Round 5 under SN 8357.Latest edition:For the third edition (August 2022), the Peruvian younger cohort household level data file (pe_r4_ychh_youngerhousehold) has been updated to include the mother&#x27;s health variables. In addition, an error in the Vietnamese younger cohort reading comprehension variables (vn_r4_yccog_youngerchildtest) has been corrected.

Older Cohort Household Questionnaire (age 19): includes sections on: Parental background; Household and child education; Livelihoods and asset framework; Household food and non-food consumption and expenditure; Social capital; Economic changes and recent life history; Socio-economic status.Older Cohort Child Questionnaire (age 19): includes sections on: Parents and Caregiver update; Mobility; Subjective well-being; Education; Employment, earnings, and time-use; Feelings and attitudes; Household decision-making; Marital and living arrangements; Fertility; Anthropometry; Health and nutrition.Older Cohort Cognitive Tests (age 19): includes Mathematics test; Reading comprehension test.Older Cohort Self-Administered Questionnaire (age 19): includes sections on: Relationship with parents, Smoking, Violence, Alcohol, Sexual behaviour (administered in Peru only).Younger Cohort Household Questionnaire (age 12): includes sections: on Parental background; Household and child education; Livelihoods and asset framework; Household food and non-food consumption and expenditure; Social capital; Economic changes and recent life history; Socio-economic status, Health; Anthropometry (for the study child and a sibling); Caregiver perceptions and attitudes.Younger Cohort Child Questionnaire (age 12): includes sections on Schooling; Time-use; Health; Social networks; Feelings and attitudes.Younger Cohort Cognitive Tests (age 12): include Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (administered to the study child and a sibling); Mathematics test; Reading comprehension test. In Ethiopia only an additional English and Amharic reading test.Community Questionnaire: (administered in the main communities where Young Lives children live) includes sections on: General characteristics of the locality; Social environment; Access to services; Economy; Local prices; Social protection; Educational services; Health services; Migration. Mini-community questionnaire: (administered in communities into which one or study children moved) includes sections on: General characteristics of the locality; Social environment; Access to Services; Economy; Local prices."/><meta property="og:title" content="Young Lives: an International Study of Childhood Poverty: Round 4, 2013-2014 / YL"/><meta property="og:description" content="The Young Lives survey is an innovative long-term project investigating the changing nature of childhood poverty in four developing countries.

poverty in four developing countries. The study is being conducted in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam and has tracked the lives of 12,000 children over a 20-year period, through 5 (in-person) survey rounds (Round 1-5) and, with the latest survey round (Round 6) conducted over the phone in 2020 and 2021 as part of the Listening to Young Lives at Work: COVID-19 Phone Survey.Round 1 of Young Lives surveyed two groups of children in each country, at 1 year old and 5 years old. Round 2 returned to the same children who were then aged 5 and 12 years old. Round 3 surveyed the same children again at aged 7-8 years and 14-15 years, Round 4 surveyed them at 12 and 19 years old, and Round 5 surveyed them at 15 and 22 years old. Thus the younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children through into adulthood, when some will become parents themselves.The 2020 phone survey consists of three phone calls (Call 1 administered in June-July 2020; Call 2 in August-October 2020 and Call 3 in November-December 2020) and the 2021 phone survey consists of two additional phone calls (Call 4 in August 2021 and Call 5 in October-December 2021) The calls took place with each Young Lives respondent, across both the younger and older cohort, and in all four study countries (reaching an estimated total of around 11,000 young people).The Young Lives survey is carried out by teams of local researchers, supported by the Principal Investigator and Data Manager in each country.Further information about the survey, including publications, can be downloaded from the Young Lives website.\\n\\nThis study includes data and documentation for Round 4 only.
