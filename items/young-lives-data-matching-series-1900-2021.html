The study is being conducted in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam and has tracked the lives of 12,000 children over a 20-year period, through 5 (in-person) survey rounds (Round 1-5) and, with the latest survey round (Round 6) conducted over the phone in 2020 and 2021 as part of the Listening to Young Lives at Work: COVID-19 Phone Survey.Round 1 of Young Lives surveyed two groups of children in each country, at 1 year old and 5 years old. Round 2 returned to the same children who were then aged 5 and 12 years old. Round 3 surveyed the same children again at aged 7-8 years and 14-15 years, Round 4 surveyed them at 12 and 19 years old, and Round 5 surveyed them at 15 and 22 years old. Thus the younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children through into adulthood, when some will become parents themselves.The 2020 phone survey consists of three phone calls (Call 1 administered in June-July 2020; Call 2 in August-October 2020 and Call 3 in November-December 2020) and the 2021 phone survey consists of two additional phone calls (Call 4 in August 2021 and Call 5 in October-December 2021) The calls took place with each Young Lives respondent, across both the younger and older cohort, and in all four study countries (reaching an estimated total of around 11,000 young people).The Young Lives survey is carried out by teams of local researchers, supported by the Principal Investigator and Data Manager in each country.Further information about the survey, including publications, can be downloaded from the Young Lives website.

Young Lives research has expanded to explore linking geographical data collected during the rounds to external datasets. Matching Young Lives data with administrative and geographic datasets significantly increases the scope for research in several areas, and may allow researchers to identify sources of exogenous variation for more convincing causal analysis on policy and/or early life circumstances. Young Lives: Data Matching Series, 1900-2021 includes the following linked datasets: 1. Climate Matched Datasets (four YL study countries): Community-level GPS data has been matched with temperature and precipitation data from the University of Delaware. Climate variables are offered at the community level, with a panel data structure spanning across years and months. Hence, each community has a unique value of precipitation (variable PRCP) and temperature (variable TEMP), for each year and month pairing for the period 1900-2017. 2. COVID-19 Matched Dataset (Peru only): The YL Phone Survey Calls data has been matched with external data sources (The Peruvian Ministry of Health and the National Information System of Deaths in Peru). The matched dataset includes the total number of COVID cases per 1,000 inhabitants, the total number of COVID deaths by district and per 1,000 inhabitants; the total number of excess deaths per 1,000 inhabitants and the number of lockdown days in each Young Lives district in Peru during August 2020 to December 2021.Further information is available in the PDF reports included in the study documentation. Climate Matched Datasets: 5 variables including anonymised community identifier, monthly average temperature, monthly total precipitation, and year and month of climate data.COVID-19 Matched DatasetÂ (Peru): 29 variables to covering anonymised respondent identifier, cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 1,000 inhabitants, fatalities, migration, vaccine distribution, and lockdown conditions implemented by the Peruvian government in areas where YL participants were living at the time of the Phone Survey Calls."/><meta property="og:title" content="Young Lives: Data Matching Series, 1900-2021"/><meta property="og:description" content="The Young Lives survey is an innovative long-term project investigating the changing nature of childhood poverty in four developing countries.

Lives: Data Matching Series, 1900-2021\",\"description\":\"The Young Lives survey is an innovative long-term project investigating the changing nature of childhood poverty in four developing countries. The study is being conducted in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam and has tracked the lives of 12,000 children over a 20-year period, through 5 (in-person) survey rounds (Round 1-5) and, with the latest survey round (Round 6) conducted over the phone in 2020 and 2021 as part of the Listening to Young Lives at Work: COVID-19 Phone Survey.Round 1 of Young Lives surveyed two groups of children in each country, at 1 year old and 5 years old. Round 2 returned to the same children who were then aged 5 and 12 years old. Round 3 surveyed the same children again at aged 7-8 years and 14-15 years, Round 4 surveyed them at 12 and 19 years old, and Round 5 surveyed them at 15 and 22 years old. Thus the younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children through into adulthood, when some will become parents themselves.The 2020 phone survey consists of three phone calls (Call 1 administered in June-July 2020; Call 2 in August-October 2020 and Call 3 in November-December 2020) and the 2021 phone survey consists of two additional phone calls (Call 4 in August 2021 and Call 5 in October-December 2021) The calls took place with each Young Lives respondent, across both the younger and older cohort, and in all four study countries (reaching an estimated total of around 11,000 young people).The Young Lives survey is carried out by teams of local researchers, supported by the Principal Investigator and Data Manager in each country.Further information about the survey, including publications, can be downloaded from the Young Lives website.\\n\\nYoung Lives research has expanded to explore linking geographical data collected during the rounds to external datasets. Matching Young Lives data with administrative and geographic datasets significantly increases the scope for research in several areas, and may allow researchers to identify sources of exogenous variation for more convincing causal analysis on policy and/or early life circumstances. Young Lives: Data Matching Series, 1900-2021 includes the following linked datasets: 1. Climate Matched Datasets (four YL study countries): Community-level GPS data has been matched with temperature and precipitation data from the University of Delaware. Climate variables are offered at the community level, with a panel data structure spanning across years and months. Hence, each community has a unique value of precipitation (variable PRCP) and temperature (variable TEMP), for each year and month pairing for the period 1900-2017. 2. COVID-19 Matched Dataset (Peru only): The YL Phone Survey Calls data has been matched with external data sources (The Peruvian Ministry of Health and the National Information System of Deaths in Peru). The matched dataset includes the total number of COVID cases per 1,000 inhabitants, the total number of COVID deaths by district and per 1,000 inhabitants; the total number of excess deaths per 1,000 inhabitants and the number of lockdown days in each Young Lives district in Peru during August 2020 to December 2021.Further information is available in the PDF reports included in the study documentation.
