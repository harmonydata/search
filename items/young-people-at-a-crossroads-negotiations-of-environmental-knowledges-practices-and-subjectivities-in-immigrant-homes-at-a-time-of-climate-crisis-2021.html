The research was conducted primarily with 14-18-year-old young people with family migration backgrounds living in Manchester or Melbourne, and secondarily with parents or grandparents of the young participants, and with teachers with an interest in climate change education in Manchester or Melbourne. 

Data were generated through interviews and focus groups, and include a sub-set of interviews conducted by young people with their parents or grandparents. Young people who took part in the research were first, second and third generation migrants. 

The collection includes transcripts of:
- 18 initial interviews with young people (usually conducted in pairs)
- 9 focus groups with young people 
- 9 young researcher-led interviews with a parent 
- 10 debrief interviews with young researchers and parents
- 14 interviews with educators
- 7 images used in focus group activities with young people

Non-identifying information about all participants who agreed for their data to be archived is included in the &#x27;YPAC participant overview&#x27; document included in the collection folder. Where participants took part but did not give consent for their data to be archived, they are acknowledged by participant code but further details are given. The &#x27;YPAC archived data log&#x27; includes details about the interview recordings and note where interviews took place, length of interview and where participant data were subsequently removed. 

Further details about research activities are included in the methodology section below.As youth climate activism grows around the world, this project will generate unique understandings into how families composed of first and second generation immigrants from the Global South (GS) are responding to lived experiences of climate crisis in two ethnically diverse cities: Manchester and Melbourne. 
As well as growing up at a historic crossroads in terms of political and societal responses to the climate crisis, second generation immigrants are at an additional crossroads in their family life, between sets of political and cultural values, economic possibilities and environmental characteristics that have roots in (at least) two countries. This pioneering project will be the first of its kind to conduct research with this often overlooked group of young people, generating insights from two cities, with young people from a range of ethnic backgrounds. The question at the heart of the project is how second generation immigrants - part of the most &#x27;climate change-aware&#x27; generation alive today - discuss and negotiate responses to the climate crisis with parents who may have first-hand experience of living with resource and climate uncertainty, yet whose knowledge is often not valued in Global North (GN) contexts. 
This area of research is both timely and important because at a time when deep-rooted adaptations are urgently needed in societies already feeling the effects of climate change, GS immigrants hold valuable knowledges that are often not known to or fully appreciated by the public and by policy makers in the GN contexts where they are living. Existing research with adult immigrants in the GN has found that immigrants show a higher disposition towards &#x27;sustainable&#x27; practices such as reducing household waste, using water sparingly, and walking or cycling over driving. As cities seek to meet ambitious sustainability agendas and as city residents increasingly feel the effects of climate change, the knowledge and experience of GS immigrants can offer insights into how to respond to drought, extreme weather and other effects of climate change. The role of young people in carrying environmental education messages from schools to homes is well researched and documented (including by the PI). However, an important but largely unexplored area is how second generation immigrants respond to and make parents&#x27; knowledge of living with climate uncertainty known in schools, where such knowledge can enrich and diversify existing climate change education. 
The project will employ an action research methodology that will support young people&#x27;s participation by training them to carry out research in their homes and work with parents, peers, teachers and researchers. The action research will result in a toolkit documenting resources for diversifying education on climate change (among other outputs)."/><meta property="og:title" content="Young People at a Crossroads: Negotiations of Environmental Knowledges, Practices and Subjectivities in Immigrant Homes at a Time of Climate Crisis, 2021-2022"/><meta property="og:description" content="This research aimed to explore migrant-background young people&#x27;s responses to climate change education and the conversations taking place between generations about climate change in families where there was a recent history of migration.

explore migrant-background young people's responses to climate change education and the conversations taking place between generations about climate change in families where there was a recent history of migration. \\n\\nThe research was conducted primarily with 14-18-year-old young people with family migration backgrounds living in Manchester or Melbourne, and secondarily with parents or grandparents of the young participants, and with teachers with an interest in climate change education in Manchester or Melbourne. \\n\\nData were generated through interviews and focus groups, and include a sub-set of interviews conducted by young people with their parents or grandparents. Young people who took part in the research were first, second and third generation migrants. \\n\\nThe collection includes transcripts of:\\n- 18 initial interviews with young people (usually conducted in pairs)\\n- 9 focus groups with young people \\n- 9 young researcher-led interviews with a parent \\n- 10 debrief interviews with young researchers and parents\\n- 14 interviews with educators\\n- 7 images used in focus group activities with young people\\n\\nNon-identifying information about all participants who agreed for their data to be archived is included in the 'YPAC participant overview' document included in the collection folder. Where participants took part but did not give consent for their data to be archived, they are acknowledged by participant code but further details are given. The 'YPAC archived data log' includes details about the interview recordings and note where interviews took place, length of interview and where participant data were subsequently removed. \\n\\nFurther details about research activities are included in the methodology section below.As youth climate activism grows around the world, this project will generate unique understandings into how families composed of first and second generation immigrants from the Global South (GS) are responding to lived experiences of climate crisis in two ethnically diverse cities: Manchester and Melbourne. \\nAs well as growing up at a historic crossroads in terms of political and societal responses to the climate crisis, second generation immigrants are at an additional crossroads in their family life, between sets of political and cultural values, economic possibilities and environmental characteristics that have roots in (at least) two countries. This pioneering project will be the first of its kind to conduct research with this often overlooked group of young people, generating insights from two cities, with young people from a range of ethnic backgrounds. The question at the heart of the project is how second generation immigrants - part of the most 'climate change-aware' generation alive today - discuss and negotiate responses to the climate crisis with parents who may have first-hand experience of living with resource and climate uncertainty, yet whose knowledge is often not valued in Global North (GN) contexts. \\nThis area of research is both timely and important because at a time when deep-rooted adaptations are urgently needed in societies already feeling the effects of climate change, GS immigrants hold valuable knowledges that are often not known to or fully appreciated by the public and by policy makers in the GN contexts where they are living. Existing research with adult immigrants in the GN has found that immigrants show a higher disposition towards 'sustainable' practices such as reducing household waste, using water sparingly, and walking or cycling over driving. As cities seek to meet ambitious sustainability agendas and as city residents increasingly feel the effects of climate change, the knowledge and experience of GS immigrants can offer insights into how to respond to drought, extreme weather and other effects of climate change. The role of young people in carrying environmental education messages from schools to homes is well researched and documented (including by the PI). However, an important but largely unexplored area is how second generation immigrants respond to and make parents' knowledge of living with climate uncertainty known in schools, where such knowledge can enrich and diversify existing climate change education. \\nThe project will employ an action research methodology that will support young people's participation by training them to carry out research in their homes and work with parents, peers, teachers and researchers.
