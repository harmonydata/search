All had experiences of &#x27;care&#x27; (foster, kinship, residential care or of living at home under supervision. Many participants had experienced several forms of care and their circumstances often changed over the course of the study). All of the participants were of &#x27;white&#x27; Scottish, British or other European origin): (A) transcripts of 22 first interviews, and associated photographs of participants&#x27; favourite and least favourite spaces, photographs of doors to favourite indoor spaces, photographs of one communal room where they lived, photographs of participants&#x27; favourite objects (sometimes participants interpreted this as including favourite people or pets (these photos have been anonymised), recordings of participants&#x27; favourite sounds including at least one music track. 
(B) Transcripts for 14 second interviews, and associated drawings of participants&#x27; &#x27;ideal&#x27; home space, drawings of their actual living circumstances, music with a message. 
Music created by the respondents, six of whom participated in  activity days at a media centre at the end of the project is also included in the collection. The project examined &#x27;belonging&#x27; in relation to the experience of children and young people with experience of potential or actual disruptions in their family circumstances, for example children living in kinship, foster or residential care.
The aim of the project was to examine the ways in which a comfortable or ambivalent sense of belonging (or not) may be established in varied and varying &#x27;home&#x27; circumstances and spaces over time. 
These concerns were explored in part through sensory experience and the project employed innovative, visual and audial qualitative methodologies in two semi-structured interviews with each of the participants (aged 10-18). The role of material objects in constructing belonging was also explored.
The project combined theoretical sociological interests in the sociology of family and relationships and of sensory experience, with the developing area of sensory methods. It also drew on social work theory in the light of UK policy concerns to incorporate a more relational approach to social care practice and to improve outcomes for &#x27;looked after&#x27; children."/><meta property="og:title" content="Young people creating belonging: Spaces, sounds and sight"/><meta property="og:description" content="The data in this collection includes material from interviews with 22 participants aged 10-23 (13 men; 9 women) from across Scotland, including urban and remote locations (14 participants were from mainland Scotland; 8 were from the Scottish islands.)
