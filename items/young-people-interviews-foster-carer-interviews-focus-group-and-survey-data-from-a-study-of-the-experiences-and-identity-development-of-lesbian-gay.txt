In-depth narrative interviews with a sample of 46 LGBT young people, from across England, aged 16-26 who are currently or were previously in care.

Narrative analysis of the interviews was used to provide an in-depth and nuanced understanding of identity development. \n2. Semi-structured interviews with 26 foster carers across England who had experience of caring for LGBT young people. Interviews provide information from carers about the young people's experiences, but also how carers see their roles, relationships and the support they need.

This is a matter for concern when research suggests that both LGBT young people and young people in care are at risk of stigma, discrimination, bullying and mental health difficulties. There is the potential, therefore, for LGBT young people in care to face a 'double jeopardy'.
