Cohort Thirteen:
The methodology of the YCS changed at Cohort Thirteen, to allow linkage with the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE) (held at the UK Data Archive under SN 5545).  Samples for Cohort Thirteen and LSYPE were taken from the same academic cohort and their questionnaires and methodology were harmonised to facilitate analysis of the merged datasets. Also, from Cohort Thirteen onwards, the YCS is only conducted in England and no longer runs in Wales. The larger sample from the combined YCS and LSYPE surveys enables analysis at a greater level of detail, for example to show gender differences within a breakdown by ethnic origin.

The data collection method for Cohort Thirteen was different to previous YCS surveys. Sweep One used a face-to-face methodology in order to address falling response rates on recent YCS cohorts. Sweeps Two, Three and Four were conducted using a mixed-mode methodology (online, telephone and face-to-face interviewing). In particular, there had been concern over differential response rates between high attainers and low attainers, and it was considered that the use of a face-to-face method at Sweep One mixed-mode at Sweeps Two to Four, would boost response rates amongst low attainers.

Users who require more detailed data than those available in the standard access files should consult the User Guide for details. The  confidentiality form to be used for such applications is available in Word format in the documentation table below.

For the second edition (February 2011), data and documentation from Sweeps Two and Three were added to the study. For the third edition (February 2012), data and documentation from Sweep Four were added.

 Sweep One mainly concentrated on identifying respondents' experiences of year 11 including careers advice; economic activity, their activity history; qualifications sought, information on Higher Education, a self completion section (covering risky behaviours) as well as some background information about their families and attitudes. 

Sweep Two focused on current activities; jobs and training; qualifications being studied for at time of interview; higher education; young people Not in Employment, Education or Training (NEET); Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA); community cohesion; own children and caring responsibilities. An activity history was also provided. 

Sweep Three focused on current activities,; jobs and training; qualifications being studied for at time of interview; higher education students; potential higher education students; sources of information, advice and guidance; relationships; own children; and caring responsibilities. An activity history was also provided. 

Sweep Four focused on jobs and training; qualifications being studied for at time of interview; NEET; apprenticeships; higher education students; potential higher education students; sources of information, advice and guidance; own children; and caring responsibilities.

Details are available from the Teaching Resources and Materials for Social Scientists (TRAMSS) website.
Cohort Thirteen:
The methodology of the YCS changed at Cohort Thirteen, to allow linkage with the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE) (held at the UK Data Archive under SN 5545).  Samples for Cohort Thirteen and LSYPE were taken from the same academic cohort and their questionnaires and methodology were harmonised to facilitate analysis of the merged datasets. Also, from Cohort Thirteen onwards, the YCS is only conducted in England and no longer runs in Wales. The larger sample from the combined YCS and LSYPE surveys enables analysis at a greater level of detail, for example to show gender differences within a breakdown by ethnic origin.

The data collection method for Cohort Thirteen was different to previous YCS surveys. Sweep One used a face-to-face methodology in order to address falling response rates on recent YCS cohorts. Sweeps Two, Three and Four were conducted using a mixed-mode methodology (online, telephone and face-to-face interviewing). In particular, there had been concern over differential response rates between high attainers and low attainers, and it was considered that the use of a face-to-face method at Sweep One mixed-mode at Sweeps Two to Four, would boost response rates amongst low attainers.

Users who require more detailed data than those available in the standard access files should consult the User Guide for details. The  confidentiality form to be used for such applications is available in Word format in the documentation table below.

For the second edition (February 2011), data and documentation from Sweeps Two and Three were added to the study. For the third edition (February 2012), data and documentation from Sweep Four were added.

 Sweep One mainly concentrated on identifying respondents' experiences of year 11 including careers advice; economic activity, their activity history; qualifications sought, information on Higher Education, a self completion section (covering risky behaviours) as well as some background information about their families and attitudes. 

Sweep Two focused on current activities; jobs and training; qualifications being studied for at time of interview; higher education; young people Not in Employment, Education or Training (NEET); Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA); community cohesion; own children and caring responsibilities. An activity history was also provided. 

Sweep Three focused on current activities,; jobs and training; qualifications being studied for at time of interview; higher education students; potential higher education students; sources of information, advice and guidance; relationships; own children; and caring responsibilities. An activity history was also provided. 

Sweep Four focused on jobs and training; qualifications being studied for at time of interview; NEET; apprenticeships; higher education students; potential higher education students; sources of information, advice and guidance; own children; and caring responsibilities. An activity history was also provided.19:T1465,The Youth Cohort Study (YCS) is a major programme of longitudinal research designed to monitor the behaviour and decisions of representative samples of young people aged sixteen upwards as they make the transition from compulsory education to further or higher education, or to the labour market. It tries to identify and explain the factors which influence post-16 transitions, for example, educational attainment, training opportunities, experiences at school. To date the YCS covers thirteen cohorts and over forty surveys. The first cohort was first surveyed in 1985 and the thirteenth in 2007. The questionnaires have been designed, over the years, to be broadly comparable, but external changes and shifts in policy interest have brought about changes - some minor, some fundamental. Cohorts One to Twelve cover England and Wales but a change to the methodology means that from Cohort Thirteen, data cover England only.
