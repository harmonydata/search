The main data sources used for the project were two nationally-representative  government-funded cohort surveys: the Youth Cohort Study for England and Wales (YCS) (held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33233), the Scottish Young Peoples Survey (SYPS) cohorts of 1984, 1986, 1988 and 1990 (held under GN 33227) and the Scottish School Leavers Survey (SSLS) after 1993 (held under GN 33266). Hitherto it has not been easy to use these surveys for analysing change over time, because of changes in design, question wording and survey procedures; major analytical challenges were posed by changes over time in courses, qualifications, occupations and social class. Comparison of Scotland with England and Wales was also difficult, because although YCS and SYPS/SSLS were similar in design during the 1980s, they became less comparable in the 1990s.

In the light of these issues, a major concern of the Education and Youth Transitions project was the construction of comparable time-series datasets from the YCS and SSLS. These new datasets enable analysis of the effects of social change on young people's experiences, outcomes and transitions, and exploration of the similarities and differences in trends across Britain.

Further information about the project may be found on the Centre for Educational Sociology Education and Youth Transitions web pages, and the ESRC Education and Youth Transitions in England, Wales and Scotland 1984-2002 project web page.

 The data include 'core' file, covering demographic details including household composition, age, gender, ethnicity, school type attended, housing, parental educational background, employment, and educational courses. Further data files cover qualifications, post-16 education and labour market participation.10:[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","title","1",{"children":"Youth Cohort Time Series for England, Wales and Scotland, 1984-2002 / Education and Youth Transitions in England, Wales and Scotland, 1984-2002"}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"description","content":"$18"}],["$","meta","3",{"property":"og:title","content":"Youth Cohort Time Series for England, Wales and Scotland, 1984-2002 / Education and Youth Transitions in England, Wales and Scotland, 1984-2002"}],["$","meta","4",{"property":"og:description","content":"$19"}],["$","meta","5",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/items/youth-cohort-time-series-for-england-wales-and-scotland-1984-2002-education-and-youth-transitions-in-england-wales-and-scotland-1984-2002"}],["$","meta","6",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Academic Resource Discovery"}],["$","meta","7",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"}],["$","meta","8",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"Youth Cohort Time Series for England, Wales and Scotland, 1984-2002 / Education and Youth Transitions in England, Wales and Scotland, 1984-2002"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["$","meta","13",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Youth Cohort Time Series for England, Wales and Scotland, 1984-2002 / Education and Youth Transitions in England, Wales and Scotland, 1984-2002"}],["$","meta","15",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$1a"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png"}],["$","link","17",{"rel":"icon","href":"/search/favicon.ico","type":"image/x-icon","sizes":"16x16"}]]
