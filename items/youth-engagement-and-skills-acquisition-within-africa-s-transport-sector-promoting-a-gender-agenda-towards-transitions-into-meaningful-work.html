The project’s core data set deposited with RESHARE comprises in-depth interviews focused on daily mobility and transport, conducted by project academic staff and young unemployed women we trained as peer researchers at the outset of the study; a small number of focus group discussions conducted by academic staff;  and diaries focused on daily mobility, mostly written by peer researchers during the pandemic.  Anonymised data sets are provided for each of the three study cities. 
Note: The research team had also anticipated collecting quantitative data concerning the pilot trainings for transport users and transport workers led by Transaid.  These were to have comprised baseline assessments, followed by post-intervention surveys after one month and six months  to assess skills uptake among participating women.  Although Transaid staff succeeded in implementing pilot training interventions in each city, in the final months of the project, COVID constraints limited recruitment numbers and the collection of baseline data amenable to statistical analysis. Collection of post-intervention data has not been possible due to COVID constraints and the requirement to end the project on 31st March 2022.  Transaid’s reports on the pilot interventions will be made available on the project website: https://transportandyouthemploymentinafrica.comAcknowledging the importance of mobilising Africa&#x27;s young women into the labour-force, this research addresses the specific impediments presented by a highly gendered transport and travel arena and the implications this has for girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s current/future access to meaningful work. Women of all ages are discriminated against, both with regard to access and use of transport (which affects their access to skills acquisition and employment across all sectors) and with reference to their employment within the transport sector itself. Relevant skills acquisition at an early age, for safely navigating transport and more equitably seeking employment is essential if they are to break through such barriers. 

We aim to understand and address these challenges through in-depth participatory research with young women of low socio-economic status in peripheral locations of Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia (one city-region per country), including piloting of skills-based interventions. 
The research has three, interlinked strands: 
a)The User Strand comprises research into improving young women&#x27;s use of transport to access training programmes and employment, built around the following questions: 
-What are the economic, social and infrastructural determinants of the transport ecology in which young women are located and how does it impact on their transport experiences and behaviours?
-How is young women&#x27;s physical access to meaningful work and associated skills building shaped by their travel potential and access to transport (i.e. especially travel safety and security for women resident in low income areas)? 
-What key skills do young women need if they are to travel safely to work and training opportunities (whether as pedestrians, as cyclists, or when negotiating public transport)? 
-How can appropriate safe travel skills training be provided? 
-What wider interventions are needed to support a safe travel skills programme [e.g. from government, transport unions, NGOs, private sector] i.e. with reference to the multiple layers of political, economic and socio-cultural decision-making processes?

b)The Employment Strand comprises research into improving women&#x27;s access to skills (e.g. commercial driving, vehicle repair/ maintenance) to enable them to obtain more meaningful employment within the transport sector, built around the following questions: 
- How have historical, social, political and economic legacies of planning and policy processes impacted on opportunities for women&#x27;s employment in the transport sector? 
-How can young women&#x27;s aspirations to work in this sector be expanded and enhanced? 
-What do young women perceive as the main barriers to skills acquisition and subsequent employment in the sector? 
-What skills training can be provided to enable young women to play a more prominent role in the sector? 
-What wider interventions are needed to support training programmes to improve women&#x27;s employment in this sector [e.g. from government, unions, NGOs, the private sector]

Development Research Unit [SALDRU] at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, and the UK-based NGO Transaid.  The project’s core data set deposited with RESHARE comprises in-depth interviews focused on daily mobility and transport, conducted by project academic staff and young unemployed women we trained as peer researchers at the outset of the study; a small number of focus group discussions conducted by academic staff;  and diaries focused on daily mobility, mostly written by peer researchers during the pandemic.  Anonymised data sets are provided for each of the three study cities. \\nNote: The research team had also anticipated collecting quantitative data concerning the pilot trainings for transport users and transport workers led by Transaid.  These were to have comprised baseline assessments, followed by post-intervention surveys after one month and six months  to assess skills uptake among participating women.  Although Transaid staff succeeded in implementing pilot training interventions in each city, in the final months of the project, COVID constraints limited recruitment numbers and the collection of baseline data amenable to statistical analysis.

Relevant skills acquisition at an early age, for safely navigating transport and more equitably seeking employment is essential if they are to break through such barriers. \n\nWe aim to understand and address these challenges through in-depth participatory research with young women of low socio-economic status in peripheral locations of Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia (one city-region per country), including piloting of skills-based interventions. \nThe research has three, interlinked strands: \na)The User Strand comprises research into improving young women's use of transport to access training programmes and employment, built around the following questions: \n-What are the economic, social and infrastructural determinants of the transport ecology in which young women are located and how does it impact on their transport experiences and behaviours?\n-How is young women's physical access to meaningful work and associated skills building shaped by their travel potential and access to transport (i.e. especially travel safety and security for women resident in low income areas)? \n-What key skills do young women need if they are to travel safely to work and training opportunities (whether as pedestrians, as cyclists, or when negotiating public transport)? \n-How can appropriate safe travel skills training be provided? \n-What wider interventions are needed to support a safe travel skills programme [e.g. from government, transport unions, NGOs, private sector] i.e. with reference to the multiple layers of political, economic and socio-cultural decision-making processes?\n\nb)The Employment Strand comprises research into improving women's access to skills (e.g. commercial driving, vehicle repair/ maintenance) to enable them to obtain more meaningful employment within the transport sector, built around the following questions: \n- How have historical, social, political and economic legacies of planning and policy processes impacted on opportunities for women's employment in the transport sector? \n-How can young women's aspirations to work in this sector be expanded and enhanced? \n-What do young women perceive as the main barriers to skills acquisition and subsequent employment in the sector? \n-What skills training can be provided to enable young women to play a more prominent role in the sector? \n-What wider interventions are needed to support training programmes to improve women's employment in this sector [e.g. from government, unions, NGOs, the private sector]\n\nc)The Action Research Strand builds on User and Employment Strand findings."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2a:[\"$\",\"meta\",\"14\",{\"name\":\"twitter:description\",\"content\":\"$2f\"}]\n2b:[\"$\",\"meta\",\"15\",{\"name\":\"twitter:image\",\"content\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/harmony.png\"}]\n2c:[\"$\",\"link\",\"16\",{\"rel\":\"icon\",\"href\":\"/search/favicon.ico\",\"type\":\"image/x-icon\",\"sizes\":\"16x16\"}]\n2d:[\"$\",\"$L30\",\"17\",{}]\n17:\"$13:metadata\"\n"])</script></body></html>
