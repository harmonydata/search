The National Child Development Study started in 1958 as the Perinatal Mortality Survey. Sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund, the survey was designed to examine the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy among the children born in Great Britain.

By collecting information on various aspects of life, the NCDS has become an invaluable data source on such diverse topics as effects of socioeconomic circumstances on health, social mobility and changes in social attitudes. Today, the 1958 cohort is one of the best resources for understanding how retirement and ageing are changing in Britain.

With quantitative and qualitative, social and biomedical data, the 1958 cohort is a leading resource for both policy development and best practice in longitudinal research.

Study website: www.cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1958-national-child-development-study/1a:T482,National Child Development Study: Sweeps 1-6, 1958-2000, Self-Reported Measures includes derived variables that were developed as part of a research study examining risk and preventive factors for chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in the National Child Development Study (NCDS) (available from the UK Data Archive under GN 33004). Data on the outcome measures was assessed in 1999-2000 during Sweep 6 of data collection, at which point the cohort members were aged 42 years. The study examines a number of life course risk markers for CFS/ME and IBS including childhood adversity, childhood illness, physical activity and psychopathology in childhood and adulthood. 

The data can be linked to the main NCDS data. Users are advised to also consult the main NCDS documentation which is available for individual Sweeps of the NCDS under 33004.
 The study includes the following measures:self-reported measures of CFS/ME and IBSa derived measure of CFS-like illnessmeasures of childhood illness and symptoms reported at 7, 11 and 16 yearsself-reported physical activity in childhood and adulthood1b:T40b,The deposit contains a dataset created for the paper, 'Many Models in R: A Tutorial'. ncds.Rds is an R format synthetic dataset created with the synthpop dataset in R using data from the National Child Development Study (NCDS), a birth cohort of individuals born in a single week of March 1958 in Britain. The dataset contains data on fourteen biomarkers collected at the age 46/47 sweep of the survey, four measures of cognitive ability from age 11 and 16, and three covariates, sex, body mass index at age 11 and father's social class. The data is only intended to be used in the tutorial - it is not to be used for drawing statistical inferences.This project contains data used in the paper, "Many Models in R: A Tutorial".  The data are a simplified, synthetic and imputed version of the National Child Development Study. There are variables for 14 biomarkers from the age 46/47 biomedical survey, 4 measures of cognitive ability from tests at ages 11 and 16, and 3 covariates (sex, father's socioeconomic class and BMI at age 11).1c:T1267,The National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a continuing longitudinal study that seeks to follow the lives of all those living in Great Britain who were born in one particular week in 1958. The aim of the study is to improve understanding of the factors affecting human development over the whole lifespan. The NCDS has its origins in the Perinatal Mortality Survey (PMS) (the original PMS study is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 2137). This study was sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund and designed to examine the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy among the 17,000 children born in England, Scotland and Wales in that one week. Selected data from the PMS form NCDS sweep 0, held alongside NCDS sweeps 1-3, under SN 5565. Survey and Biomeasures Data (GN 33004):To date there have been nine attempts to trace all members of the birth cohort in order to monitor their physical, educational and social development. The first three sweeps were carried out by the National Children's Bureau, in 1965, when respondents were aged 7, in 1969, aged 11, and in 1974, aged 16 (these sweeps form NCDS1-3, held together with NCDS0 under SN 5565). The fourth sweep, also carried out by the National Children's Bureau, was conducted in 1981, when respondents were aged 23 (held under SN 5566). In 1985 the NCDS moved to the Social Statistics Research Unit (SSRU) - now known as the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS). The fifth sweep was carried out in 1991, when respondents were aged 33 (held under SN 5567). For the sixth sweep, conducted in 1999-2000, when respondents were aged 42 (NCDS6, held under SN 5578), fieldwork was combined with the 1999-2000 wave of the 1970 Birth Cohort Study (BCS70), which was also conducted by CLS (and held under GN 33229). The seventh sweep was conducted in 2004-2005 when the respondents were aged 46 (held under SN 5579), the eighth sweep was conducted in 2008-2009 when respondents were aged 50 (held under SN 6137) and the ninth sweep was conducted in 2013 when respondents were aged 55 (held under SN 7669). Four separate datasets covering responses to NCDS over all sweeps are available. National Child Development Deaths Dataset: Special Licence Access (SN 7717) covers deaths; National Child Development Study Response and Outcomes Dataset (SN 5560) covers all other responses and outcomes; National Child Development Study: Partnership Histories (SN 6940) includes data on live-in relationships; and National Child Development Study: Activity Histories (SN 6942) covers work and non-work activities. Users are advised to order these studies alongside the other waves of NCDS.From 2002-2004, a Biomedical Survey was completed and is available under End User Licence (EUL) (SN 8731) and Special Licence (SL) (SN 5594). Proteomics analyses of blood samples are available under SL SN 9254.Linked Geographical Data (GN 33497): A number of geographical variables are available, under more restrictive access conditions, which can be linked to the NCDS EUL and SL access studies. Linked Administrative Data (GN 33396):A number of linked administrative datasets are available, under more restrictive access conditions, which can be linked to the NCDS EUL and SL access studies. These include a Deaths dataset (SN 7717) available under SL and the Linked Health Administrative Datasets (SN 8697) available under Secure Access.Additional Sub-Studies (GN 33562):In addition to the main NCDS sweeps, further studies have also been conducted on a range of subjects such as parent migration, unemployment, behavioural studies and respondent essays.

The National Child Development Study (NCDS) originated in the ‘Perinatal Mortality Survey’, which examined social and obstetric factors associated with still birth and infant mortality among over 17,000 babies born in Britain in the week 3-9 March 1958. Surviving members of this birth cohort have been surveying on eight further occasions in order to monitor their changing health, education, social and economic circumstances – in 1965 (age 7), 1969 (age 11), 1974 (age 16), 1981 (age 23), 1991 (age 33), 1999/2000 (age 41/42), 2004/05 (age 46/47), 2008/09 (age 50) and 2013/14 (age 55).1d:Tf3c,Childhood adversity is associated with poor health in adulthood. Yet substantially less is known about protective psychosocial factors in childhood (also known as resources) that may promote health across the lifespan. Protective factors are not the mere opposite of risk factors, and research suggests that adults with higher versus lower levels of psychosocial resources have better health outcomes. However, psychosocial resources in childhood have received little attention. Given recent calls to implement primordial prevention strategies to improve population health, this is a significant gap. Thus, the overall hypothesis guiding this research is that childhood psychosocial resources - including positive affect, optimism, purpose in life, life satisfaction, and supportive social relationships - may foster healthy patterns across adulthood. This research capitalized on essays that members of the National Child Development Study wrote at age 11 about their imagined future lives at age 25. A team of judges rated the essays, a rich and unique data source, for the presence of psychosocial resources so that associations with adult health could be explored. This data collection provides background materials for rating the age 11 essays from the National Child Development Study. The data itself can be requested from the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) via clsfeedback@ucl.ac.uk.Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and the prevalence of certain cardiovascular risk factors continues to rise. These trends suggest that primary and secondary prevention efforts could be accompanied by primordial prevention, which seeks to preserve the ideal cardiovascular health that most children experience early in life. However, the psychosocial factors in childhood that promote cardiovascular functioning are vastly understudied. Initial evidence indicates that adversity in childhood (e.g., socioeconomic disadvantage, abuse) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk in adulthood. Yet substantially less is known about protective psychosocial factors in childhood (also known as resources) that may promote cardiovascular functioning. Protective factors are not the mere opposite of risk factors, and research suggests that adults with psychosocial resources have reduced risk of CVD. To date, however, protective psychosocial factors in childhood have received little attention. Given recent calls to implement primordial prevention strategies, this is a significant gap. Thus, the overall hypothesis of the proposed research is that psychosocial resources in childhood (including positivity, optimism, purpose in life, and supportive social relationships) may foster healthy behavioral patterns in early adulthood that contribute to reduced cardiometabolic risk in middle age. The specific aims to be tested are: 1) determine whether psychosocial resources in childhood protect against cardiometabolic risk in adulthood, 2) determine whether psychosocial resources in childhood are associated with healthier behavior in adulthood, and 3) determine whether psychosocial resources are linked with cardiometabolic risk in adulthood via healthier behaviors. The proposed research will capitalize on data from the 1958 British Birth Cohort (i.e., the National Child Development Study), which assessed psychosocial resources at age 11, health behaviors at age 33, and cardiometabolic risk at age 45. Notably, childhood psychosocial resources will be determined based on essays that cohort members wrote at age 11 about their future lives at age 25. Trained judges will rate this rich and unique data source for the presence of psychosocial resources so that associations with adult health behaviors and cardiometabolic risk can be determined. The proposed work will advance understanding of how psychosocial factors play a role in the primordial prevention of CVD.1e:T1213,The National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a continuing longitudinal study that seeks to follow the lives of all those living in Great Britain who were born in one particular week in 1958.

It brings together leading longitudinal studies, the British Library and the UK Data Service, to stimulate interdisciplinary research, develop shared resources, provide training, and share expertise. Resources available from CLOSER include harmonised datasets (developed to facilitate cross-study comparisons) and CLOSER Discovery (a search engine that enables researchers to search and browse questionnaires and data from different longitudinal studies). CLOSER’s website also includes a range of training materials focused on longitudinal studies and data. CLOSER is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and is based at the UCL Institute of Education.Further information can be found on the CLOSER website. The content of longitudinal studies, including questions, topics and variables can be explored via the CLOSER Discovery website. 

 The National Child Development Study: CLOSER Training Dataset, 1958-2013 provides a set of variables derived from the 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS), for training purposes.

NCDS started in 1958 as the Perinatal Mortality Survey, designed to examine the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy among the children born in Great Britain.  It collected information on approximately 17,500 babies born in England, Scotland and Wales in one week of 1958, succeeding in covering 98.5% of those born in that week.  

The scope of the survey was broadened as it developed into a longitudinal study, aiming to follow-up respondents at ten further time-points throughout their lives to monitor their health, development, education, social circumstances, employment and possible family formation as adults. These follow-up sweeps include NCDS1 (1965 age 7), NCDS2 (1969 age 11), NCDS3 (1974, age16) and adult sweeps NCDS4-9 at ages 23, 33, 42, 44 (Biomedical sweep), 46, 50, 55, and most recently at ages 61-64.

 This study includes questions covering the following topics: personal and family background; childhood cognitive test results; exam results; body-mass index; marital/partnership status; employment/economic status; voting preferences; smoking and drinking status/frequency; psychological distress or depression; health and well-being.20:T1156,This deposit contains three do files which were constructed as part of the project “Intergenerational income mobility: Gender, Partnerships and Poverty in the UK”, UKRI grant number ES/P007899/1. The aim of the do files is to convert partnership, fertility, and labour market activity information provided with the age 55 wave of the National Child Development Study into monthly panel format. There are separate do files to do this for each of the three aspects.This important new work looks to fill an 'evidence deficit' within the literature on intergenerational economic mobility by investigating intergenerational income mobility for two groups who are often overlooked in existing research: women and the poorest in society. To do this, the research will make two methodological advancements to previous work: First, moving to focus on the family unit in the second generation and total family resources rather than individual labour market earnings and second, looking across adulthood to observe partnership, fertility and poverty dynamics rather than a point-in-time static view of these important factors. 
Specifically it will ask four research questions:
1) What is the relationship between family incomes of parents in childhood and family incomes of daughters throughout adulthood? 
The majority of previous studies of intergenerational income mobility have focused on the relationship between parents' income in childhood and sons' prime-age labour market earnings. Women have therefore been consistently disregarded due to difficulties observing prime-age labour market earnings for women. This is because women often exit the labour market for fertility reasons, and the timing of this exit and the duration of the spell out of the labour market are related to both parental childhood income and current labour market earnings. This means that previous studies that have focused on employed women only are not representative of the entire population of women. By combining our two advancements, considering total family income and looking across adulthood for women, we can minimise these issues. The life course approach enables us to observe average resources across a long window of time, dealing with issues of temporary labour market withdrawal, while the use of total family income gives the most complete picture of resources available to the family unit including partner's earnings and income from other sources, including benefits. 
2) What role do partnerships and assortative mating play in this process across the life course?
The shift to focusing on the whole family unit emphasises the importance of partnerships including when they occur and breakdown and who people partner with in terms of education and current labour market earnings. Previous research on intergenerational income mobility in the UK has suggested an important role for who people partner with but has been limited to only focusing on those in partnerships. This work will advance our understanding of partnership dynamics by looking across adulthood at both those in partnerships and at the importance of family breakdown and lone parenthood in this relationship. 
3) What is the extent of intergenerational poverty in the UK, and does this persist through adulthood? 
The previous focus on individuals' labour market earnings has often neglected to consider intergenerational income mobility for the poorest in society: those without labour market earnings for lengthy periods of time who rely on other income from transfers and benefits. The shift in focus to total family resources and the life course approach will allow us to assess whether those who grew up in poor households are more likely to experience persistent poverty themselves in adulthood. 
4) What is the role of early skills, education and labour market experiences, including job tenure and progression, in driving these newly estimated relationships? 
Finally our proposed work will consider the potential mechanisms for these new estimates of intergenerational income mobility for women and the poorest in society for the first time and expand our understanding of potential mechanisms for men. While our previous work showed the importance of early skills and education in transmitting inequality across generations for males, this new work will also consider the role of labour market experiences including job tenure and promotions as part of the process.21:T12b9,The National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a continuing longitudinal study that seeks to follow the lives of all those living in Great Britain who were born in one particular week in 1958.

Developed with the assistance of the NCDS User Support Group, the sets are designed for use in courses in sociology and statistics across the social sciences.  By providing data and supporting material focusing on contemporary British society, the packages give students a realistic empirical base on which to develop their methodological and substantive skills.  The packages require minimal knowledge of computing or quantitative research methods.22:T126e,The National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a continuing longitudinal study that seeks to follow the lives of all those living in Great Britain who were born in one particular week in 1958.

This NCDS sample survey was conducted in 1995, between the fifth (NCDS5) and sixth (NCDS6) full follow-up surveys of the NCDS cohort (NCDS5 was conducted in 1991 and NCDS6 in 1999-2000). The 1995 survey aimed to collect details about cohort members' basic skills. It was designed to supplement the information on self-reported literacy and numeracy problems gathered during the NCDS4 (conducted in 1981) and NCDS5 follow-ups, with objective assessments of skills in these areas. It provides for a detailed analysis of the extent, antecedents and correlates of basic skills in the NCDS cohort.

The network’s core aim was to explore individual differences in mid-life cognitive capacity and how these relate to experiences and behaviour earlier in life.  

The pilot study was conducted with a sub-sample of NCDS members living in and around Cambridge in 2010, when study members were aged 52, and sought to investigate the potential for conducting neuro-psychological assessments with purposive sub-samples from the British Birth Cohort Studies.26:T12ba,The National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a continuing longitudinal study that seeks to follow the lives of all those living in Great Britain who were born in one particular week in 1958. The aim of the study is to improve understanding of the factors affecting human development over the whole lifespan. The NCDS has its origins in the Perinatal Mortality Survey (PMS) (the original PMS study is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 2137). This study was sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund and designed to examine the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy among the 17,000 children born in England, Scotland and Wales in that one week. Selected data from the PMS form NCDS sweep 0, held alongside NCDS sweeps 1-3, under SN 5565. Survey and Biomeasures Data (GN 33004):To date there have been ten attempts to trace all members of the birth cohort in order to monitor their physical, educational and social development. The first three sweeps were carried out by the National Children's Bureau, in 1965, when respondents were aged 7, in 1969, aged 11, and in 1974, aged 16 (these sweeps form NCDS1-3, held together with NCDS0 under SN 5565). The fourth sweep, also carried out by the National Children's Bureau, was conducted in 1981, when respondents were aged 23 (held under SN 5566). In 1985 the NCDS moved to the Social Statistics Research Unit (SSRU) - now known as the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS). The fifth sweep was carried out in 1991, when respondents were aged 33 (held under SN 5567). For the sixth sweep, conducted in 1999-2000, when respondents were aged 42 (NCDS6, held under SN 5578), fieldwork was combined with the 1999-2000 wave of the 1970 Birth Cohort Study (BCS70), which was also conducted by CLS (and held under GN 33229). The seventh sweep was conducted in 2004-2005 when the respondents were aged 46 (held under SN 5579), the eighth sweep was conducted in 2008-2009 when respondents were aged 50 (held under SN 6137), the ninth sweep was conducted in 2013 when respondents were aged 55 (held under SN 7669), and the tenth sweep was conducted in 2020-24 when the respondents were aged 60-64 (held under SN 9412). A Secure Access version of the NCSD is available under SN 9413, containing detailed sensitive variables not available under Safeguarded access (currently only sweep 10 data). Variables include uncommon health conditions (including age at diagnosis), full employment codes and income/finance details, and specific life circumstances (e.g. pregnancy details, year/age of emigration from GB).Four separate datasets covering responses to NCDS over all sweeps are available. National Child Development Deaths Dataset: Special Licence Access (SN 7717) covers deaths; National Child Development Study Response and Outcomes Dataset (SN 5560) covers all other responses and outcomes; National Child Development Study: Partnership Histories (SN 6940) includes data on live-in relationships; and National Child Development Study: Activity Histories (SN 6942) covers work and non-work activities.

Information was gathered for some 508 individuals, both handicapped and non-handicapped. The study was carried out for the Committee of Enquiry into the Education of Handicapped Children and Young People (the Warnock Committee) by a team based at the National Children's Bureau. The central aim of the study was to provide information on how handicapped young people negotiated the crucial transition from school to work, the employment opportunities available to them and to describe their early experiences in the labour market.

For the second edition (February 2012), the Centre for Longitudinal Studies made improvements to the existing data and documentation, including revised variable names, addition of variable and value labels and missing values, and the addition of an identifier variable. For full details, see the documentation.
 The purpose of the study was to describe some early labour market experiences of handicapped young people. The questionnaire covered areas such as: education, leaving school, employment, income, health and household composition.28:T11a4,The National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a continuing longitudinal study that seeks to follow the lives of all those living in Great Britain who were born in one particular week in 1958.

Surviving members of this birth cohort have been surveyed on eight further occasions in order to monitor their changing health, education, social and economic circumstances - in 1965 at age 7, 1969 at age 11, 1974 at age 16 (the first three sweeps are also held under SN 5565), 1981 (age 23 - SN 5566), 1991 (age 33 - SN 5567), 1999/2000 (age 41/2 - SN 5578), 2004-2005 (age 46/47 - SN 5579), 2008-2009 (age 50 - SN 6137) and 2013 (age 55 - SN 7669).There have also been surveys of sub-samples of the cohort, the most recent occurring in 1995 (age 37), when a 10% representative sub-sample was assessed for difficulties with basic skills (SN 4992). Finally, during 2002-2004, 9,340 NCDS cohort members participated in a bio-medical survey, carried out by qualified nurses (SN 5594, available under more restrictive Special Licence access conditions; see catalogue record for details). The bio-medical survey did not cover any of the topics included in the 2004/2005 survey. Further NCDS data separate to the main surveys include a response and deaths dataset, parent migration studies, employment, activity and partnership histories, behavioural studies and essays - see the NCDS series page for details.Further information about the NCDS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies website.How to access genetic and/or bio-medical sample data from a range of longitudinal surveys:A useful overview of the governance routes for applying for genetic and bio-medical sample data, which are not available through the UK Data Service, can be found at Governance of data and sample access on the METADAC (Managing Ethico-social, Technical and Administrative issues in Data Access) website.Sample of Essays (Sweep 2, Age 11), 1969
When the children of the National Child Development Study (NCDS) were 11 years old, at the time of the NCDS 2 sweep, they were given a short questionnaire to complete at school about their interests outside school, the school subjects they enjoyed most, and what they thought they were most likely to do when they left secondary school. In addition, they were asked to write an essay about what they thought their life would be like at age 25. The instructions given were as follows:

'Imagine you are now 25 years old. Write about the life you are leading, your interests, your home life and your work at the age of 25. (You have 30 minutes to do this).'

Of the 14,757 children who participated in the age 11 sweep of the NCDS (representing 90.8% of the target sample of 16,253 (Plewis et al. 2004), a total of 13,669 (92.6%) completed an essay about their imagined life at age 25. From this a sub-sample of essays was extracted for deposit based on three key variables: gender of the cohort member, social class and family background, and the ability of the cohort member using a general ability test. The original spelling and grammar of the essays was preserved.

Users should note that a subset of 179 of these essays are also held with SN 6691,  Social Participation and Identity, 2007-2010, a subproject conducted by CLS with a sample of NCDS participants at age 50.February 2021 releaseThis study was withdrawn in 2020, and then reinstated in February 2021 at the depositor's request. The title of the study has changed, but data and documentation materials remain the same. The essays contain information about what the age 11 NCDS Cohort Members thought their life would be like at age 25. An SPSS file containing a coding frame for the descriptive content of the essays and associated data about the cohort is available as part of this data set.2c:T1cad,The National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a continuing longitudinal study that seeks to follow the lives of all those living in Great Britain who were born in one particular week in 1958. The aim of the study is to improve understanding of the factors affecting human development over the whole lifespan. The NCDS has its origins in the Perinatal Mortality Survey (PMS) (the original PMS study is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 2137). This study was sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund and designed to examine the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy among the 17,000 children born in England, Scotland and Wales in that one week. Selected data from the PMS form NCDS sweep 0, held alongside NCDS sweeps 1-3, under SN 5565. Survey and Biomeasures Data (GN 33004):To date there have been nine attempts to trace all members of the birth cohort in order to monitor their physical, educational and social development. The first three sweeps were carried out by the National Children's Bureau, in 1965, when respondents were aged 7, in 1969, aged 11, and in 1974, aged 16 (these sweeps form NCDS1-3, held together with NCDS0 under SN 5565). The fourth sweep, also carried out by the National Children's Bureau, was conducted in 1981, when respondents were aged 23 (held under SN 5566). In 1985 the NCDS moved to the Social Statistics Research Unit (SSRU) - now known as the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS). The fifth sweep was carried out in 1991, when respondents were aged 33 (held under SN 5567). For the sixth sweep, conducted in 1999-2000, when respondents were aged 42 (NCDS6, held under SN 5578), fieldwork was combined with the 1999-2000 wave of the 1970 Birth Cohort Study (BCS70), which was also conducted by CLS (and held under GN 33229). The seventh sweep was conducted in 2004-2005 when the respondents were aged 46 (held under SN 5579), the eighth sweep was conducted in 2008-2009 when respondents were aged 50 (held under SN 6137) and the ninth sweep was conducted in 2013 when respondents were aged 55 (held under SN 7669). Four separate datasets covering responses to NCDS over all sweeps are available. National Child Development Deaths Dataset: Special Licence Access (SN 7717) covers deaths; National Child Development Study Response and Outcomes Dataset (SN 5560) covers all other responses and outcomes; National Child Development Study: Partnership Histories (SN 6940) includes data on live-in relationships; and National Child Development Study: Activity Histories (SN 6942) covers work and non-work activities. Users are advised to order these studies alongside the other waves of NCDS.From 2002-2004, a Biomedical Survey was completed and is available under End User Licence (EUL) (SN 8731) and Special Licence (SL) (SN 5594). Proteomics analyses of blood samples are available under SL SN 9254.Linked Geographical Data (GN 33497): A number of geographical variables are available, under more restrictive access conditions, which can be linked to the NCDS EUL and SL access studies. Linked Administrative Data (GN 33396):A number of linked administrative datasets are available, under more restrictive access conditions, which can be linked to the NCDS EUL and SL access studies. These include a Deaths dataset (SN 7717) available under SL and the Linked Health Administrative Datasets (SN 8697) available under Secure Access.Additional Sub-Studies (GN 33562):In addition to the main NCDS sweeps, further studies have also been conducted on a range of subjects such as parent migration, unemployment, behavioural studies and respondent essays.

The eighth sweep of NCDS was conducted in 2008-2009, when respondents were aged 50 years.  The core aims of the NCDS8 were to update the life history information collected in previous studies and to collect new information to help understand the ageing process. Many of the questions in the NCDS8 follow-up had been asked in earlier waves of the NCDS and the BCS, which will allow for the making of comparisons both across the sweeps of NCDS and with the BCS cohort.

The 2008-2009 survey is comprised of the following elements:a 55 minute a 'core' interview (included a Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI); Computer Assisted Self Interview (CASI); a series of cognitive assessments)a paper questionnaireEdition history:
The NCDS8 has been deposited at the UK Data Archive in stages. For the first Archive edition (March 2009) an interim data file was deposited, based on 2,997 interviews completed between August and December 2008. This file comprised a subset of the full list of variables. 
The second Archive edition (the first full sample edition) was released in February 2010. This deposit included responses to the bulk of the questions fielded to cohort members in 2008-2009. The variables that were not included in this file were essentially those that required the most complex post-fieldwork editing in order to make them usable, mostly those that related to the four 'history' modules; housing history, relationship history, fertility history and economic activity history. In addition, variables relating to absent children, older children and specific details of recently-achieved qualifications were not included (although a series of derived summary variables relating to highest qualification were). 
For the third Archive edition (October 2012), the final version of NCDS8 was deposited. Two files, 'ncds_2008_followup.sav' and 'ncds8_unfolding_brackets.sav' replaced the previous single data file, a new User Guide replaced the previous version, and the Technical Report and Appendices were added to the documentation. For further details, see the User Guide.

CAPI interview:
The CAPI interview collected updated information about household composition, housing, relationships, births and other pregnancies, periods of lone parenthood, adopted children, absent and older children, parents, family income, economic activity, education and qualifications, work-related training, use of computers, health, smoking, drinking, exercise, height, weight, social participation and social support. 

CASI interview: 
The CASI interview collected information on voting behaviour and party support, experience of symptoms of the menopause, problematic drinking behaviour, well-being, relationship satisfaction, domestic division of labour, job commitment, attitudes towards pensions and retirement, childhood, efficacy and life satisfaction. 

Standard Measures
The interview included several established scales: Kanungo’s Job Involvement Scale; the AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) and the Malaise 

The cognitive assessment module is comprised of four tasks: Word list recall test; Animal naming task; Letter cancellation task; Delayed word list recall test.2d:T169a,The National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a continuing longitudinal study that seeks to follow the lives of all those living in Great Britain who were born in one particular week in 1958.

Data on live-in relationships lasting one month or more have been collected in all National Child Development Study: Partnership Histories (NCDS) sweeps from sweep 5 (age 33). The focus of the questions asked at each sweep are about the relationship start date; whether married/became civil partner (sweep 8 and later) to this partner and if so the marriage/civil partnership dates; whether still together with this partner and if not the date that the relationship ended; how the relationship ended; if relevant whether divorced and divorce dates; the sex, marital status and age at start of relationship of the partner.
Edition information
The first edition of the NCDS partnership histories, deposited at the UK Data Service  in December 2011 included partnerships, reported by cohort members, up to and including the 2008 data sweep. The second edition of the NCDS partnership histories (November 2017) includes partnership data from the latest NCDS data sweep (2013). Some modifications have also been made to the pre-2013 NCDS partnership data due to enhancements to the NCDS partnership histories program and additional data cleaning.

 The study includes two datasets:NCDS Partnership dataset: One record is recorded for each partnership. Cohabitation transformed into marriage is recorded as two separate partnershipsNCDS Partner dataset: One record is recorded for each partner.

Data on work and non-work activities lasting one month or more have been collected in all NCDS sweeps from sweep 4 (age 23) onwards. 

The focus of the questions asked at each sweep vary from: work activities engaged in since leaving school (sweep 4 aged 23); work and non-work activities engaged in since leaving school (sweep 5, aged 33); work and non-work activities engaged in since the last sweep (sweep 6, aged 42); work and non-work activities engaged in since the last sweep or aged 16 (sweep 7, aged 46) work and non-work activities engaged in since 2000, or 2004 if included in sweep 7 (sweep 8, aged 50), work and non-work activities engaged in since 2004, or 2008 if included in sweep 8 (sweep 9, aged 55). Therefore the activity histories will start from the time that the cohort member left school and continue until the interview date of the latest data sweep that each cohort member participated in.                                                                       

The lengths of the activity histories vary depending on the latest sweep that a cohort member was present at. The minimum activity history length recorded is 1 month and the maximum is 480 months (40 years). Gaps in the activity histories occur where a cohort member has not been present at all sweeps and/or where full activity data were not reported.

An employment histories dataset was previously created (Ward, 2007). This work was undertaken as part of the Gender Network Project. The current work on NCDS activity histories builds on this previous activity history and incorporates various cleaning of the data. This previous employment history included data up to sweep 7 (2004) only, did not deal with any non-work activities and did not identify duplicate activities (i.e. where an activity was reported again in a later sweep). 

Latest Edition Information
For the second edition (June 2016) the data and documentation were updated to include the latest NCDS wave, extending coverage to 2013.

This question parallels another asked of the cohort members at NCDS2 when they were 11 years old, who then wrote about their imagined life at age 25 (see under SN 8313). The question could potentially be used as a way to code for cohort members' pessimism or optimism about the future, and the extent to which they are planning for the future.30:T5f4,The Cohort and Longitudinal Studies Enhancement Resources (CLOSER) project aims to maximise the use, value and impact of longitudinal research. It brings together leading longitudinal studies, the British Library and the UK Data Service, to stimulate interdisciplinary research, develop shared resources, provide training, and share expertise. Resources available from CLOSER include harmonised datasets (developed to facilitate cross-study comparisons) and CLOSER Discovery (a search engine that enables researchers to search and browse questionnaires and data from different longitudinal studies). CLOSER’s website also includes a range of training materials focused on longitudinal studies and data. CLOSER is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and is based at the UCL Institute of Education.The CLOSER Work Package 2 provides the harmonisation of socio-economic measures between the National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), National Child Development Study (NCDS), 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), and the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS).Further information can be found on the CLOSER website.

In addition, they were asked to write an essay about what they thought their life would be like at age 25. The instructions given were as follows:

The aim of the study is to improve understanding of the factors affecting human development over the whole lifespan. The NCDS has its origins in the Perinatal Mortality Survey (PMS) (the original PMS study is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 2137). This study was sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund and designed to examine the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy among the 17,000 children born in England, Scotland and Wales in that one week. Selected data from the PMS form NCDS sweep 0, held alongside NCDS sweeps 1-3, under SN 5565. Survey and Biomeasures Data (GN 33004):To date there have been nine attempts to trace all members of the birth cohort in order to monitor their physical, educational and social development. The first three sweeps were carried out by the National Children's Bureau, in 1965, when respondents were aged 7, in 1969, aged 11, and in 1974, aged 16 (these sweeps form NCDS1-3, held together with NCDS0 under SN 5565). The fourth sweep, also carried out by the National Children's Bureau, was conducted in 1981, when respondents were aged 23 (held under SN 5566). In 1985 the NCDS moved to the Social Statistics Research Unit (SSRU) - now known as the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS). The fifth sweep was carried out in 1991, when respondents were aged 33 (held under SN 5567). For the sixth sweep, conducted in 1999-2000, when respondents were aged 42 (NCDS6, held under SN 5578), fieldwork was combined with the 1999-2000 wave of the 1970 Birth Cohort Study (BCS70), which was also conducted by CLS (and held under GN 33229).

It will provide high-dimensional biological information on these individuals during early midlife (aged 42 to 44), prior to the onset of most chronic disease, and at an age that is underrepresented in most cohorts, including UK Biobank (UKB).40:T12b1,The National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a continuing longitudinal study that seeks to follow the lives of all those living in Great Britain who were born in one particular week in 1958. The aim of the study is to improve understanding of the factors affecting human development over the whole lifespan. The NCDS has its origins in the Perinatal Mortality Survey (PMS) (the original PMS study is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 2137). This study was sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund and designed to examine the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy among the 17,000 children born in England, Scotland and Wales in that one week. Selected data from the PMS form NCDS sweep 0, held alongside NCDS sweeps 1-3, under SN 5565. Survey and Biomeasures Data (GN 33004):To date there have been nine attempts to trace all members of the birth cohort in order to monitor their physical, educational and social development. The first three sweeps were carried out by the National Children's Bureau, in 1965, when respondents were aged 7, in 1969, aged 11, and in 1974, aged 16 (these sweeps form NCDS1-3, held together with NCDS0 under SN 5565). The fourth sweep, also carried out by the National Children's Bureau, was conducted in 1981, when respondents were aged 23 (held under SN 5566). In 1985 the NCDS moved to the Social Statistics Research Unit (SSRU) - now known as the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS). The fifth sweep was carried out in 1991, when respondents were aged 33 (held under SN 5567). For the sixth sweep, conducted in 1999-2000, when respondents were aged 42 (NCDS6, held under SN 5578), fieldwork was combined with the 1999-2000 wave of the 1970 Birth Cohort Study (BCS70), which was also conducted by CLS (and held under GN 33229). The seventh sweep was conducted in 2004-2005 when the respondents were aged 46 (held under SN 5579), the eighth sweep was conducted in 2008-2009 when respondents were aged 50 (held under SN 6137) and the ninth sweep was conducted in 2013 when respondents were aged 55 (held under SN 7669). Four separate datasets covering responses to NCDS over all sweeps are available. National Child Development Deaths Dataset: Special Licence Access (SN 7717) covers deaths; National Child Development Study Response and Outcomes Dataset (SN 5560) covers all other responses and outcomes; National Child Development Study: Partnership Histories (SN 6940) includes data on live-in relationships; and National Child Development Study: Activity Histories (SN 6942) covers work and non-work activities. Users are advised to order these studies alongside the other waves of NCDS.From 2002-2004, a Biomedical Survey was completed and is available under End User Licence (EUL) (SN 8731) and Special Licence (SL) (SN 5594). Proteomics analyses of blood samples are available under SL SN 9254.Linked Geographical Data (GN 33497): A number of geographical variables are available, under more restrictive access conditions, which can be linked to the NCDS EUL and SL access studies. Linked Administrative Data (GN 33396):A number of linked administrative datasets are available, under more restrictive access conditions, which can be linked to the NCDS EUL and SL access studies. These include a Deaths dataset (SN 7717) available under SL and the Linked Health Administrative Datasets (SN 8697) available under Secure Access.Additional Sub-Studies (GN 33562):In addition to the main NCDS sweeps, further studies have also been conducted on a range of subjects such as parent migration, unemployment, behavioural studies and respondent essays.

NCDS6:
The sixth NCDS sweep took place in 1999-2000, when cohort members were aged 41-42 years. Fieldwork was combined with the 29-year follow-up for the
1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), also conducted by CLS.

SN 5578 supersedes the former combined NCDS6/BCS70 1999-2000 dataset, which was held under SN 4396
National Child Development Study and 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) Follow-ups, 1999-2000. The Centre for Longitudinal Studies updated the first six waves of NCDS in late 2006, and as part of this work separated the composite NCDS6/BCS70 dataset. Improvements made include further data cleaning and the addition of new documentation.41:T12ba,The National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a continuing longitudinal study that seeks to follow the lives of all those living in Great Britain who were born in one particular week in 1958.

The fourth sweep, also carried out by the National Children's Bureau, was conducted in 1981, when respondents were aged 23 (held under SN 5566). In 1985 the NCDS moved to the Social Statistics Research Unit (SSRU) - now known as the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS). The fifth sweep was carried out in 1991, when respondents were aged 33 (held under SN 5567). For the sixth sweep, conducted in 1999-2000, when respondents were aged 42 (NCDS6, held under SN 5578), fieldwork was combined with the 1999-2000 wave of the 1970 Birth Cohort Study (BCS70), which was also conducted by CLS (and held under GN 33229). The seventh sweep was conducted in 2004-2005 when the respondents were aged 46 (held under SN 5579), the eighth sweep was conducted in 2008-2009 when respondents were aged 50 (held under SN 6137) and the ninth sweep was conducted in 2013 when respondents were aged 55 (held under SN 7669). Four separate datasets covering responses to NCDS over all sweeps are available. National Child Development Deaths Dataset: Special Licence Access (SN 7717) covers deaths; National Child Development Study Response and Outcomes Dataset (SN 5560) covers all other responses and outcomes; National Child Development Study: Partnership Histories (SN 6940) includes data on live-in relationships; and National Child Development Study: Activity Histories (SN 6942) covers work and non-work activities. Users are advised to order these studies alongside the other waves of NCDS.From 2002-2004, a Biomedical Survey was completed and is available under End User Licence (EUL) (SN 8731) and Special Licence (SL) (SN 5594). Proteomics analyses of blood samples are available under SL SN 9254.Linked Geographical Data (GN 33497): A number of geographical variables are available, under more restrictive access conditions, which can be linked to the NCDS EUL and SL access studies. Linked Administrative Data (GN 33396):A number of linked administrative datasets are available, under more restrictive access conditions, which can be linked to the NCDS EUL and SL access studies.

The aim of the study is to improve understanding of the factors affecting human development over the whole lifespan. The NCDS has its origins in the Perinatal Mortality Survey (PMS) (the original PMS study is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 2137). This study was sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund and designed to examine the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy among the 17,000 children born in England, Scotland and Wales in that one week. Selected data from the PMS form NCDS sweep 0, held alongside NCDS sweeps 1-3, under SN 5565. Survey and Biomeasures Data (GN 33004):To date there have been ten attempts to trace all members of the birth cohort in order to monitor their physical, educational and social development.

It brings together leading longitudinal studies, the British Library and the UK Data Service, to stimulate interdisciplinary research, develop shared resources, provide training, and share expertise. Resources available from CLOSER include harmonised datasets (developed to facilitate cross-study comparisons) and CLOSER Discovery (a search engine that enables researchers to search and browse questionnaires and data from different longitudinal studies). The CLOSER website also includes a range of training materials focused on longitudinal studies and data. CLOSER is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and is based at the UCL Institute of Education.The CLOSER Work Package 1 provides data harmonisation of anthropometric measures between the National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), National Child Development Study (NCDS), 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), and the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS).

The Harmonised Height, Weight and BMI in Five Longitudinal Cohort Studies: National Child Development Study provides the harmonised data on height, weight and BMI for NCDS.c:[["$","$L16",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$17"}}],["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":["$","$L18",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS)","description":"$19","url":["","https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1958-national-child-development-study)","https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1958-national-child-development-study/","https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.cls.ncds/524c8f92-493f-4660-90c4-0aa7ac3d2640","https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=NCDS58","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=NCDS"],"keywords":["Covid-19 data collection","Biomarkers","Cognitive measures","Work and employment","Social care - receipt","Political and social attitudes","Parenting and family","Social care - provision","Sexuality and gender identity","Migration and immigration","Education","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Reproductive health","Loneliness and social isolation","Language and literacy","Physical health assessment","Housing","Sleep problems","Social care - need","Victimisation and life events","Diet and nutrition"],"identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-015-0273-z","https://doi.org/10.1001/archpsyc.64.6.668","https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyi183","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.12841","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-015-0273-z"],"variableMeasured":"$undefined","includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"CLOSER Discovery","url":"https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.cls.ncds/524c8f92-493f-4660-90c4-0aa7ac3d2640","image":"https://closer.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/closer-2022/www/images/closer-logo-full.svg"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies","url":"https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration: UK LLC","url":"https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=NCDS58","image":"https://ukllc.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/ukllc-theme/assets/images/UKLLC_Logo_Landscape_Black.svg"},{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=NCDS","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"}],"publisher":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Centre for Longitudinal Studies, UCL Institute of Education"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) - Institute of Education (IoE), UCL"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Professor George Ploubidis"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"UCL"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) - Institute of Education (IoE), UCL"}],"funder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Economic and Social Research Council"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"ESRC MRC NIH DfWP Wellcome\nNational Birthday Trust Fund"}],"copyrightHolder":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"UCL"}],"license":["https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/data-access-training/access-ukds/"],"image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/NCDS.png","size":"18558"},"extra_data":{"duration_years":null,"start_year":null,"harmony_id":"closer/national-child-development-study","end_year":null,"data_access":null,"urls":["","https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1958-national-child-development-study)","https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1958-national-child-development-study/","https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.cls.ncds/524c8f92-493f-4660-90c4-0aa7ac3d2640","https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=NCDS58","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=NCDS"],"source":["ukllc","closer","cls","ukds","mhc"],"geographic_coverage":"","genetic_data_collected":false,"num_variables":null,"name":"1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS)","sample_size":18558,"dois":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-015-0273-z","https://doi.org/10.1001/archpsyc.64.6.668","https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyi183","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.12841","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-015-0273-z"],"sex":"all","study_design":[],"language_codes":["en"],"ai_summary":"The 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS) is a longitudinal study that tracks the lives of approximately 17,000 individuals born in a single week in 1958 in England, Scotland, and Wales. Initially launched as the Perinatal Mortality Survey, the study aimed to investigate the social and obstetric factors linked to stillbirth and early infant mortality. Over the years, the NCDS has evolved to collect a wide range of data, including quantitative and qualitative, social, and biomedical information. This comprehensive dataset has been instrumental in exploring various topics such as the impact of socioeconomic status on health, social mobility, and shifts in social attitudes. The study is particularly valuable for understanding the dynamics of retirement and aging in Britain. The NCDS is recognized as a critical resource for policy development and advancing best practices in longitudinal research.","country_codes":["GB"],"num_sweeps":16,"slug":"1958-national-child-development-study-ncds","instruments":[],"resource_type":"study","uuid":"0f98a49d0e80872a80f5412f024bc57f","number_of_variables":28884},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"child_datasets":[{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"National Child Development Study: Sweeps 1-6, 1958-2000, Self-Reported Measures / Derived Measures from the National Child Development Study and 1958 British Birth Cohort: Self-Reported Measures; NCDS","description":"$1a","url":["https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=6760"],"keywords":["Covid-19 data collection","Biomarkers","Cognitive measures","Work and employment","Social care -

49:T41b,The 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS) follows the lives of 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1958.

The National Child Development Study started in 1958 as the Perinatal Mortality Survey. Sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund, the survey was designed to examine the social and obstetric factors associated with stillbirth and death in early infancy among the children born in Great Britain.

By collecting information on various aspects of life, the NCDS has become an invaluable data source on such diverse topics as effects of socioeconomic circumstances on health, social mobility and changes in social attitudes. Today, the 1958 cohort is one of the best resources for understanding how retirement and ageing are changing in Britain.

With quantitative and qualitative, social and biomedical data, the 1958 cohort is a leading resource for both policy development and best practice in longitudinal research.
