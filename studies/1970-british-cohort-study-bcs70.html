The aim of the do files is to convert partnership, fertility, and labour market activity information provided with the age 46 wave of the British Cohort Study  (BCS70) into monthly panel format. There are separate do files to do this for each of the three aspects.This important new work looks to fill an 'evidence deficit' within the literature on intergenerational economic mobility by investigating intergenerational income mobility for two groups who are often overlooked in existing research: women and the poorest in society. To do this, the research will make two methodological advancements to previous work: First, moving to focus on the family unit in the second generation and total family resources rather than individual labour market earnings and second, looking across adulthood to observe partnership, fertility and poverty dynamics rather than a point-in-time static view of these important factors.\n\nSpecifically it will ask four research questions:\n\n1) What is the relationship between family incomes of parents in childhood and family incomes of daughters throughout adulthood?\nThe majority of previous studies of intergenerational income mobility have focused on the relationship between parents' income in childhood and sons' prime-age labour market earnings. Women have therefore been consistently disregarded due to difficulties observing prime-age labour market earnings for women. This is because women often exit the labour market for fertility reasons, and the timing of this exit and the duration of the spell out of the labour market are related to both parental childhood income and current labour market earnings. This means that previous studies that have focused on employed women only are not representative of the entire population of women. By combining our two advancements, considering total family income and looking across adulthood for women, we can minimise these issues. The life course approach enables us to observe average resources across a long window of time, dealing with issues of temporary labour market withdrawal, while the use of total family income gives the most complete picture of resources available to the family unit including partner's earnings and income from other sources, including benefits.\n\n2) What role do partnerships and assortative mating play in this process across the life course?\nThe shift to focusing on the whole family unit emphasises the importance of partnerships including when they occur and breakdown and who people partner with in terms of education and current labour market earnings. Previous research on intergenerational income mobility in the UK has suggested an important role for who people partner with but has been limited to only focusing on those in partnerships. This work will advance our understanding of partnership dynamics by looking across adulthood at both those in partnerships and at the importance of family breakdown and lone parenthood in this relationship.\n\n3) What is the extent of intergenerational poverty in the UK, and does this persist through adulthood?\nThe previous focus on individuals' labour market earnings has often neglected to consider intergenerational income mobility for the poorest in society: those without labour market earnings for lengthy periods of time who rely on other income from transfers and benefits. The shift in focus to total family resources and the life course approach will allow us to assess whether those who grew up in poor households are more likely to experience persistent poverty themselves in adulthood.\n\n4) What is the role of early skills, education and labour market experiences, including job tenure and progression, in driving these newly estimated relationships?\nFinally our proposed work will consider the potential mechanisms for these new estimates of intergenerational income mobility for women and the poorest in society for the first time and expand our understanding of potential mechanisms for men. While our previous work showed the importance of early skills and education in transmitting inequality across generations for males, this new work will also consider the role of labour market experiences including job tenure and promotions as part of the process."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1a:T519,The Cohort and Longitudinal Studies Enhancement Resources (CLOSER) project aims to maximise the use, value and impact of longitudinal research.

This information was particularly important as the response by teachers to the main survey's 'Educational Questionnaire' (Document L) was disappointing, because of the widespread industrial action that year in protest against government educational reforms. The head teacher questionnaire achieved a slightly better response (4,592 pupils covered, as opposed to 3,760 for Document L).The head teacher questionnaires were not able to be keyed, documented and deposited at the time of the survey, due to lack of resources, but funding finally became available in 2004-05 to complete this task at the CLS.A school type variable for the full BCS70 cohort, derived from data in the Head Teacher Questionnaire, is available as part of the main Sweep 4 study (available from the UK Data Service under SN 3535).Latest edition informationFor the sixth edition (September 2022), the data file has been updated with a minor labelling change. \n Topics covered in the head teacher questionnaire include type and history of school (Local Education Authority (LEA) grammar, LEA comprehensive, independent and others); curriculum and subjects covered; structure of classes; teaching staff and facilities available; teaching methods; special needs coverage; vocational education; extra-curricular activities; discipline; pastoral care; and demographic characteristics of school intake, including socio-economic characteristics, ethnic mix, etc.\n\nThe questionnaire answers have been linked to individual-level records for each child attending that school, matchable to a member of the BCS70 cohort.

The purpose of the study is to merge all data on work and non-work activities in successive BCS sweeps into one longitudinal dataset.\nThe focus of the questions asked at each sweep vary between current work activity; work and non-work activities engaged in since the age of 16; work and non-work activities engaged in since the age of 16, over time and between sweeps. Therefore the activity histories will start from the age of 16 and continue until the interview date of the latest data sweep that each cohort member participated in.\nThe length of the activity histories vary depending on the latest sweep that a cohort member was present at. The minimum activity history length recorded is 1 month and the maximum is 387 months (32 years). Gaps in the activity histories occur where a cohort member has not been present at all sweeps and/or where full activity data were not reported.\n\nFor the fourth edition (March 2021) data reported on activities for Sweep 10 were added to the study. Longitudinal datasets have also been streamlined by removing cases which have never participated in any main sweep survey and are no longer being issued. Further details are included in the documentation, which has also been updated.\n\n\n The BCS70 Activity Histories dataset contains one record for each work or non-work activity."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"24:Te8e,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) is a longitudinal birth cohort study, following a nationally representative sample of over 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1970.

Teachers were given the option of electing to ask for a Special Educational Pack with easier tests for any child for whom they considered the standard testing too hard. The other criteria for selecting children for the receipt of Special Educational Packs included children who had completed the ordinary pack but had scored in the bottom 5 per cent on the Edinburgh Reading Test and/or the Friendly Maths Test. All children receiving Special Educational Treatment (SET) were also sent a Special Educational Pack. Each Special Educational Pack contained the standard educational test material which teachers were asked to try with the child in order to know where the child fitted within the lower end of the distributions of the standard pack test scores.\n\nSurvey instrumentation for Sweep 3 was distributed through education and health authorities. The Special Needs Tests were included in the materials distributed through Local Education Authorities and, where parental consent was obtained, administered to cohort members in school with the assistance of teachers.\n\nFor the second edition (June 2016) a small number of primary identifiers (BCSID) have been changed to realign them to previous sweeps of data.

The main aim of this data linkage exercise is to enhance the research potential of the study, by combining administrative record with the rich information collected in the surveys. The\n1970 British Cohort Study: Linked Health Administrative Datasets (Hospital Episode Statistics), England, 1997-2023: Secure Access contains information about all hospital admissions in England. The following linked HES data are available:\n1) Accident and Emergency (A\u0026E)\nThe A\u0026E dataset details each attendance to an Accident and Emergency care facility in England, between 01-04-2007 and 31-03-2019 (inclusive). It includes major A\u0026E departments, single speciality A\u0026E departments, minor injury units and walk-in centres in England.\n2) Admitted Patient Care (APC)\nThe APC data summarises episodes of care for admitted patients, where the episode occurred between 01-04-1997 and 31-03-2023 (inclusive).\n3) Critical Care (CC)\nThe CC dataset covers records of critical care activity between 01-04-2009 and 31-03-2023 (inclusive).\n4) Out Patient (OP)\nThe OP dataset lists the outpatient appointments between 01-04-2003 and 31-03-2023 (inclusive).\n5) Emergency Care Dataset (ECDS)\nThe ECDS lists the emergency care appointments between 01-04-2020 and 31-03-2023 (inclusive).\n6) Consent data\nThe consents dataset describes consent to linkage, and is current at the time of deposit\nCLS/ NHS Digital Sub-licence agreement\nNHS Digital has given CLS permission for onward sharing of the Next Steps/HES dataset via the UKDS Secure Lab. In order to ensure data minimisation, NHS Digital requires that researchers only access the HES variables needed for their approved research project. Therefore, the HES linked data provided by the UKDS to approved researchers will be subject to sub-setting of variables. The researcher will need to request a specific sub-set of variables from the Next Steps HES data dictionary, which will subsequently make available within their UKDS Secure Account. Once the researcher has finished their research, the UKDS will delete the tailored dataset for that specific project.\n\nAny party wishing to access the data deposited at the UK Data Service will be required to enter into a Licence agreement with CLS (UCL), in addition to the agreements signed with the UKDS, provided in the application pack.\n\nThe Licensee shall acknowledge in any publication, whether printed, electronic or broadcast, based wholly or in part on such materials, both the source of the data and UCL.

NCDS, BCS70, Next Steps, and MCS receive core funding from the ESRC and are hosted by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies at UCL. NSHD is funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and is hosted by the Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL. The Fertility Harmonisation project aimed to enhance data in these four British cohort studies (NSHD, NCDS, Next Steps and BCS70) through retrospective harmonisation of fertility information. This retrospective harmonisation serves two primary purposes: improving the measurement of fertility (as an outcome, predictor, or control variable) within cohort analyses, and facilitating cross-cohort research on fertility using these rich datasets.Separate longitudinal datasets were created for each cohort, covering survey sweeps from early adulthood to the early fifties, marking the end of the reproductive window for most cohort members. Derived variables provide a summary of fertility (live births) at each survey sweep, including whether the cohort member had children, the number of children, the age of the eldest and youngest child, and the number of boys and girls. The focus was exclusively on live births, excluding pregnancies that were terminated, miscarriages, or stillbirths.Harmonised fertility data for the MRC National Survey of Health and Development are available under Special Licence from SN 9419. The following three data files are included:harmonised_fertility_histories_ncds: the dataset contains fertility variables derived in the NCDS at age 23, 33, 42, 46 and 50.harmonised_fertility_histories_bcs: the dataset contains fertility variables derived in the BCS70 at age 26, 30, 38, 42, 46 and 51.harmonised_fertility_histories_nextsteps: the dataset contains fertility variables derived in Next Steps at age 25 and 32.Individual identifiers are included to enable the harmonised data to be merged with the main cohort study data."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"a:[[\"$\",\"$L12\",null,{\"strategy\":\"beforeInteractive\",\"id\":\"structured-data\",\"type\":\"application/ld+json\",\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"$13\"}}],[\"$\",\"$L14\",null,{\"study\":{\"uuid\":\"492057ed65e8bc0e7cada6297729b277\",\"title\":\"1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70)\",\"description\":\"The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) follows the lives of more than 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1970.\\n\\nThe study covers various aspects of life, including health; physical, cognitive and social development; parenting; career paths; and economic circumstances.

1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) is a longitudinal study that tracks the lives of over 17,000 individuals born in a single week of 1970 across England, Scotland, and Wales. The study aims to provide comprehensive insights into various life aspects, including health, development (physical, cognitive, and social), parenting, career trajectories, and economic conditions. Data is collected from multiple sources such as clinical records, medical exams, diaries, and reports from parents, teachers, and the cohort members themselves. The findings from BCS70 have significantly contributed to understanding key societal challenges in the UK, offering valuable evidence for policy-making in areas like social mobility, education, employment, and economic security.\",\"urls\":[\"https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1970-british-cohort-study/\",\"https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1970-british-cohort-study/)\",\"https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.cls.bcs70/75fe4705-0c94-4f75-b1e6-ad9c61ffde26\",\"https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=BCS70\",\"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study\u0026studyid=BCS\"],\"name\":\"1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70)\",\"num_variables\":null,\"country_codes\":[\"GB\"],\"language_codes\":[\"en\"],\"dois\":[\"https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jhealeco.2009.10.003\",\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyl174\",\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-016-0767-z\"],\"source\":[\"cls\",\"ukds\",\"closer\",\"mhc\",\"ukllc\"],\"geographic_coverage\":\"\",\"resource_type\":\"study\",\"duration_years\":null,\"start_year\":null,\"genetic_data_collected\":false,\"instruments\":\"$a:1:props:study:instruments\",\"slug\":\"1970-british-cohort-study-bcs70\",\"harmony_id\":\"closer/1970-british-cohort-study\",\"data_access\":null,\"end_year\":null,\"uuid\":\"492057ed65e8bc0e7cada6297729b277\",\"number_of_variables\":14242},\"distance\":0,\"score\":0,\"parent\":{},\"ancestors\":[],\"child_datasets\":\"$a:1:props:study:child_datasets\"}}]]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"10:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"name\":\"viewport\",\"content\":\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"}]]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"title\",\"1\",{\"children\":\"1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70)\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) follows the lives of more than 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1970.\\n\\nThe study covers various aspects of life, including health; physical, cognitive and social development; parenting; career paths; and economic circumstances.
