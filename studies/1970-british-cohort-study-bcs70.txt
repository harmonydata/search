Harmonised variables are included on the following areas:emotional problemspeer problemsbehavioural problemsattention / hyperactivity problems1a:T1151,This deposit contains three do files which were constructed as part of the project “Intergenerational income mobility: Gender, Partnerships and Poverty in the UK”, UKRI grant number ES/P007899/1. The aim of the do files is to convert partnership, fertility, and labour market activity information provided with the age 46 wave of the British Cohort Study  (BCS70) into monthly panel format. There are separate do files to do this for each of the three aspects.This important new work looks to fill an 'evidence deficit' within the literature on intergenerational economic mobility by investigating intergenerational income mobility for two groups who are often overlooked in existing research: women and the poorest in society. To do this, the research will make two methodological advancements to previous work: First, moving to focus on the family unit in the second generation and total family resources rather than individual labour market earnings and second, looking across adulthood to observe partnership, fertility and poverty dynamics rather than a point-in-time static view of these important factors.

Specifically it will ask four research questions:

1) What is the relationship between family incomes of parents in childhood and family incomes of daughters throughout adulthood?
The majority of previous studies of intergenerational income mobility have focused on the relationship between parents' income in childhood and sons' prime-age labour market earnings. Women have therefore been consistently disregarded due to difficulties observing prime-age labour market earnings for women. This is because women often exit the labour market for fertility reasons, and the timing of this exit and the duration of the spell out of the labour market are related to both parental childhood income and current labour market earnings. This means that previous studies that have focused on employed women only are not representative of the entire population of women. By combining our two advancements, considering total family income and looking across adulthood for women, we can minimise these issues. The life course approach enables us to observe average resources across a long window of time, dealing with issues of temporary labour market withdrawal, while the use of total family income gives the most complete picture of resources available to the family unit including partner's earnings and income from other sources, including benefits.

2) What role do partnerships and assortative mating play in this process across the life course?
The shift to focusing on the whole family unit emphasises the importance of partnerships including when they occur and breakdown and who people partner with in terms of education and current labour market earnings. Previous research on intergenerational income mobility in the UK has suggested an important role for who people partner with but has been limited to only focusing on those in partnerships. This work will advance our understanding of partnership dynamics by looking across adulthood at both those in partnerships and at the importance of family breakdown and lone parenthood in this relationship.

3) What is the extent of intergenerational poverty in the UK, and does this persist through adulthood?
The previous focus on individuals' labour market earnings has often neglected to consider intergenerational income mobility for the poorest in society: those without labour market earnings for lengthy periods of time who rely on other income from transfers and benefits. The shift in focus to total family resources and the life course approach will allow us to assess whether those who grew up in poor households are more likely to experience persistent poverty themselves in adulthood.

4) What is the role of early skills, education and labour market experiences, including job tenure and progression, in driving these newly estimated relationships?
Finally our proposed work will consider the potential mechanisms for these new estimates of intergenerational income mobility for women and the poorest in society for the first time and expand our understanding of potential mechanisms for men. While our previous work showed the importance of early skills and education in transmitting inequality across generations for males, this new work will also consider the role of labour market experiences including job tenure and promotions as part of the process.1b:T519,The Cohort and Longitudinal Studies Enhancement Resources (CLOSER) project aims to maximise the use, value and impact of longitudinal research.

Cohort members have been surveyed throughout their childhood and adult lives, mapping their individual trajectories and creating a unique resource for researchers. It is one of very few longitudinal studies following people of this generation anywhere in the world.Since 1970, cohort members have been surveyed at ages 5, 10, 16, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, and 51. Featuring a range of objective measures and rich self-reported data, BCS70 covers an incredible amount of ground and can be used in research on many topics. Evidence from BCS70 has illuminated important issues for our society across five decades. Key findings include how reading for pleasure matters for children's cognitive development, why grammar schools have not reduced social inequalities, and how childhood experiences can impact on mental health in mid-life. Every day researchers from across the scientific community are using this important study to make new connections and discoveries.BCS70 is run by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS), a research centre in the UCL Institute of Education, which is part of University College London.

The BCS70 Birth and 22-Month Sub-sample
The aims of the birth survey and the 22-month sub-sample survey were to assess obstetric services and the quality of life in the first week of life, and to attempt to identify foetal malnutrition and to investigate its effect on the subsequent development of the child.

1970 British Cohort Study: Age 16, Sweep 4, 1986
The purpose of the 16-year follow-up was to review and evaluate adolescent (mid-teenage) health, care, education, social and family environment throughout Great Britain, as experienced by the BCS70 cohort. At the same time, a parallel survey was also conducted with head teachers of schools likely to be attended by cohort members. The main impetus behind this was to find out more about these schools, especially as many of the cohort members were about to leave full-time education. The head teacher questionnaires were not able to be keyed, documented and deposited at the time of the survey due to lack of resources, but funding finally became available in 2004/5 to complete this task at CLS. The resulting dataset is archived under SN 5225.Latest edition informationFor the ninth edition (September 2022), a derived dataset (bcs70_age16_school_type) has been added, which includes age 16 school type data for the entire BCS cohort. This is derived from STYPE (BCS4), B9SC16TP (BCS9) and the 1986 School Census. A user guide describing this variable in full has also been added. In addition, the derived variable BD4STYPE has been removed from the data file bcs4derived.

The impetus behind the 1970 British Cohort Study: Age 16, Sweep 4 Head Teacher Questionnaire, 1986 survey, which was sent out to every school in Great Britain which anyone born in the target cohort sample week in 1970 was likely to be attending, was to find out more about the schools attended by cohort members, especially as many of the members were about to leave full-time education. This information was particularly important as the response by teachers to the main survey's 'Educational Questionnaire' (Document L) was disappointing, because of the widespread industrial action that year in protest against government educational reforms. The head teacher questionnaire achieved a slightly better response (4,592 pupils covered, as opposed to 3,760 for Document L).The head teacher questionnaires were not able to be keyed, documented and deposited at the time of the survey, due to lack of resources, but funding finally became available in 2004-05 to complete this task at the CLS.A school type variable for the full BCS70 cohort, derived from data in the Head Teacher Questionnaire, is available as part of the main Sweep 4 study (available from the UK Data Service under SN 3535).Latest edition informationFor the sixth edition (September 2022), the data file has been updated with a minor labelling change. 
 Topics covered in the head teacher questionnaire include type and history of school (Local Education Authority (LEA) grammar, LEA comprehensive, independent and others); curriculum and subjects covered; structure of classes; teaching staff and facilities available; teaching methods; special needs coverage; vocational education; extra-curricular activities; discipline; pastoral care; and demographic characteristics of school intake, including socio-economic characteristics, ethnic mix, etc.

The questionnaire answers have been linked to individual-level records for each child attending that school, matchable to a member of the BCS70 cohort. Each variable is labelled, with value labels applied for all categorical numeric variables. Open-ended questions have been left as string variables, after editing to delete any identifying fine-level geographical references.22:Td0e,The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) is a longitudinal birth cohort study, following a nationally representative sample of over 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1970.

1970 British Cohort Study: Partnership Histories, 1986-2016: 
Data on live-in relationships lasting one month or more have been collected in all BCS70 sweeps from sweep 6 (age 30) as well as data on current live-in relationship at sweep 5 (age 23). The purpose of the
Partnership Histories dataset is to merge all data on live-in relationships in successive sweeps into one longitudinal dataset.

The focus of the questions asked at each sweep are about the relationship start date; whether married/became civil partner (sweep 8 and later) to this partner and if so the marriage/civil partnership dates; whether still together with this partner and if not the date that the relationship ended; how the relationship ended; if relevant whether divorced and divorce dates; the sex, marital status and age at start of relationship of the partner.

For the fourth edition (March 2021), both data files have been updated to include partnership data from the latest BCS70 data sweep (2016). Following Sweep 10 (2016, age 46), longitudinal datasets have been streamlined by removing cases which have never participated in any main sweep survey and are no longer being issued.



 The study includes two datasets:

1970 British Cohort Study: Activity Histories, 1986-2016:
Data on work and non-work activities lasting one month or more have been collected in all BCS70 sweeps from sweep 5 (age 26) onwards. The purpose of the study is to merge all data on work and non-work activities in successive BCS sweeps into one longitudinal dataset.
The focus of the questions asked at each sweep vary between current work activity; work and non-work activities engaged in since the age of 16; work and non-work activities engaged in since the age of 16, over time and between sweeps. Therefore the activity histories will start from the age of 16 and continue until the interview date of the latest data sweep that each cohort member participated in.
The length of the activity histories vary depending on the latest sweep that a cohort member was present at. The minimum activity history length recorded is 1 month and the maximum is 387 months (32 years). Gaps in the activity histories occur where a cohort member has not been present at all sweeps and/or where full activity data were not reported.

For the fourth edition (March 2021) data reported on activities for Sweep 10 were added to the study. Longitudinal datasets have also been streamlined by removing cases which have never participated in any main sweep survey and are no longer being issued. Further details are included in the documentation, which has also been updated.

SN 8547 - 1970 British Cohort Study: Age 46, Sweep 10, 2016-2018:
The aim of the 46-year follow-up was to collect key details of the cohort members’ lives including their socio-economic circumstances (e.g. household composition, cohabiting relationships, housing, economic activity, and income) and their health (physical health, mental health, medication, and health behaviours). This survey had a significant biomedical focus, with objective health measurements and assessments being conducted for the first time in the cohort members’ adulthood.The 'bcs_age46_child_died' and 'bcs_age46_unsuccessful_pregnancies' datasetsThis note is to inform researchers that the 'bcs_age46_child_died' and 'bcs_age46_unsuccessful_pregnancies' datasets, which were previously available as safeguarded data under EUL, have been classified as controlled data by CLS and can only be accessed via the UKDS SecureLab, subject to the UKDS Secure Access licence. The aim of this note is to provide practical information and guidance to researchers who have downloaded the BCS70 Age 46 datasets 'bcs_age46_child_died' and 'bcs_age46_unsuccessful_pregnancies' from the UK Data Archive. CLS requires that all EUL holders delete their versions of these datasets. Should they require them, users can apply for access through the new Secure Access study SN 9115. However, where a user has downloaded these dataset and is using them in a current project, they may continue to use the data and any outputs derived from their use until the project is completed. On completion of the project, users are then required to delete the original datasets. Future projects should use the new versions of the data. Any users having concerns about this should contact CLS. Further guidelines on destroying data are provided in the UKDS guidelines.Latest edition informationFor the second edition (July 2023), a new data file including newly derived nutritional intake variables based on the food composition table from the UK Nutrient Databank (UKNDB) has been added to the study.

The 1970 British Cohort Study: Age 16, Sweep 4 Dietary Diaries, 1986 was part of the BCS70 Age 16 follow-up survey (see SN 3535), where the teenage respondents completed a dietary diary including everything they ate for four days. 
The reasons why these data had not previously been deposited at the UKDS, and are held separately from the main survey data, are described in detail in the user guide. It should be noted this data is in a somewhat 'raw' format.
As online dietary diaries were completed also as part of the Age 46 survey (SN 8547), the resource will nevertheless provide opportunities for longitudinal comparisons and the number of participants (4,760) provide a large degree of statistical power.

The 1970 British Cohort Study: Age 16, Sweep 4 Leisure and Television Diaries, 1986 study was part of the BCS70 Age 16 follow-up survey known as 'Youthscan', available at the UK Data Archive under SN 3535, where respondents completed two diaries; one of leisure activities, and the other of television viewing, over a consecutive four-day period (Friday-Monday).Of the 11,622 cohort members who completed one or more sections of the 16-year 
Youthscan study, 7,243 (62 per cent) attempted to complete a leisure diary. Some only 
managed two or three of the four days. Others left parts of the diary blank or provided entries 
that were illegible. 75 per cent of the diaries were collected between June and September, July being the most frequent month.6,946 cohort members completed a television diary over the relevant four-day period.
The leisure and television diary data have not hitherto been available for analysis.
The leisure and television diary data are available as four separate datasets:leisure diary episode - an episode being defined as the period of time during which the activity, location and the co-presence with others does not changeleisure diary calendar - gives a five-minute by five-minute account of all the diary fieldsleisure diary aggregate - contains totals of the number of minutes per day spent in each of forty main activity groupstelevision diary event29:T9d9,The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) began in 1970 when data were collected about the births and families of babies born in the United Kingdom in one particular week in 1970. Since then, there have been nine further full data collection exercises in order to monitor the cohort members' health, education, social and economic circumstances. These took place when respondents were aged 5 in 1975, aged 10 in 1980, aged 16 in 1986, aged 26 in 1996, aged 30 in 1999-2000 (SN 5558), aged 34 in 2004-2005, aged 42 in 2012, aged 46 in 2016-2018 and aged 51 in 2021-2024. A range of sub-studies has also been conducted, including SN 4715, 1970 British Cohort Study: Age 21 Sample Survey, 1992 and SN 7064, 1970 British Cohort Study: Age 10, Sweep 3 Special Needs Survey, 1980.Further information about the BCS70 and may be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies website. As well as BCS70, the CLS now also conducts the NCDS series. The 1970 British Cohort Study: Age 21 Sample Survey, 1992 was the fourth sample follow-up of the 1970 BCS cohort. It focused principally on: youth training; full-time education; post-school vocational qualifications; unemployment; current or most recent employment; literacy and numeracy.

The survey comprised four sections: the main interview, a set of literacy and numeracy assessments and two self-completion questionnaires ('Your Life Since 1986' and 'Your Views').
The interview covered qualifications, training, current employment, unemployment, reading and writing behaviour, literacy and numeracy self-appraisal, household composition, relationships, children, housing, income and health.
The literacy and numeracy assessments comprised a series of 17 tasks using showcards, to assess reading, writing, comprehension and simple mathematical skills.
Self-completion: the 'Your Life Since 1986' questionnaire covered employment and education histories since 1986, and 'Your Views' gathered information on attitudes to employment, education, literacy, numeracy, self-efficacy, health and opinion of respondent's life so far.

Cohort members have been surveyed throughout their childhood and adult lives, mapping their individual trajectories and creating a unique resource for researchers. It is one of very few longitudinal studies following people of this generation anywhere in the world.Since 1970, cohort members have been surveyed at ages 5, 10, 16, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, and 51. Featuring a range of objective measures and rich self-reported data, BCS70 covers an incredible amount of ground and can be used in research on many topics.

BCS70 County Data, 1986-2012: Special Licence AccessThese data link BCS70 respondents from sweeps 3 – 9 (inclusive). For the fourth edition (January 2020) a new version of the data has been deposited, modified to provide a more consistent geography for researchers. All cohort members in each sweep of the study from 1980 onward (i.e. BCS3) have been allocated to counties (England and Wales) or regions/districts (Scotland), based on 1981 boundaries. The documentation has also been updated.
The county data are only available under a Special Licence, which has more restrictive access conditions than the standard End User Licence (EUL) used for the main BCS70 datasets (see 'Access' section). Please contact the HelpDesk for further details. Users who make a successful application for the county data will also need to download the main EUL BCS70 Sweeps 3-9 datasets to match the counties to them. The BCS70 County Data provide geographic data for counties (England and Wales) or regions/districts (Scotland) at 1981 boundaries for respondents to BCS70 Sweep 3 (1980) BCS70 Sweep 4 (1986) BCS70 Sweep 5 (1996) BCS70 Sweep 6 (2000); BCS70 Sweep 7 (2004); BCS70 Sweep 8 (2008); BCS70 Sweep 9 (2012).2b:Tae1,The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) began in 1970 when data were collected about the births and families of babies born in the United Kingdom in one particular week in 1970.

As well as BCS70, the CLS now also conducts the NCDS series. 1970 British Cohort Study: Age 10, Sweep 3 Special Needs Survey, 1980One particular concern on the educational side of the BCS70 Sweep 3 (see SN 3723), when respondents were aged 10 years, was to gather information on educational attainment on children who were unlikely to be able to complete the educational attainment tests administered at ten years. Teachers were given the option of electing to ask for a Special Educational Pack with easier tests for any child for whom they considered the standard testing too hard. The other criteria for selecting children for the receipt of Special Educational Packs included children who had completed the ordinary pack but had scored in the bottom 5 per cent on the Edinburgh Reading Test and/or the Friendly Maths Test. All children receiving Special Educational Treatment (SET) were also sent a Special Educational Pack. Each Special Educational Pack contained the standard educational test material which teachers were asked to try with the child in order to know where the child fitted within the lower end of the distributions of the standard pack test scores.

Survey instrumentation for Sweep 3 was distributed through education and health authorities. The Special Needs Tests were included in the materials distributed through Local Education Authorities and, where parental consent was obtained, administered to cohort members in school with the assistance of teachers.

For the second edition (June 2016) a small number of primary identifiers (BCSID) have been changed to realign them to previous sweeps of data. See the documentation for full details of the work done.
 The data cover: respondents' literacy, numeracy and educational attainment; medical and educational help received; behaviour and emotional states; parental role and family environment; psychological and educational tests.2c:Td28,The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) is a longitudinal birth cohort study, following a nationally representative sample of over 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1970.

Health; medical records; medication; prescriptions.34:T1228,The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) is a longitudinal birth cohort study, following a nationally representative sample of over 17,000 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1970. Cohort members have been surveyed throughout their childhood and adult lives, mapping their individual trajectories and creating a unique resource for researchers. It is one of very few longitudinal studies following people of this generation anywhere in the world.Since 1970, cohort members have been surveyed at ages 5, 10, 16, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, and 51. Featuring a range of objective measures and rich self-reported data, BCS70 covers an incredible amount of ground and can be used in research on many topics. Evidence from BCS70 has illuminated important issues for our society across five decades. Key findings include how reading for pleasure matters for children's cognitive development, why grammar schools have not reduced social inequalities, and how childhood experiences can impact on mental health in mid-life.

In 2012, consent was sought for data linkage of health administrative records from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) to survey data for cohort members in the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70). The main aim of this data linkage exercise is to enhance the research potential of the study, by combining administrative record with the rich information collected in the surveys. The
1970 British Cohort Study: Linked Health Administrative Datasets (Hospital Episode Statistics), England, 1997-2023: Secure Access contains information about all hospital admissions in England. The following linked HES data are available:
1) Accident and Emergency (A&E)
The A&E dataset details each attendance to an Accident and Emergency care facility in England, between 01-04-2007 and 31-03-2019 (inclusive). It includes major A&E departments, single speciality A&E departments, minor injury units and walk-in centres in England.
2) Admitted Patient Care (APC)
The APC data summarises episodes of care for admitted patients, where the episode occurred between 01-04-1997 and 31-03-2023 (inclusive).
3) Critical Care (CC)
The CC dataset covers records of critical care activity between 01-04-2009 and 31-03-2023 (inclusive).
4) Out Patient (OP)
The OP dataset lists the outpatient appointments between 01-04-2003 and 31-03-2023 (inclusive).
5) Emergency Care Dataset (ECDS)
The ECDS lists the emergency care appointments between 01-04-2020 and 31-03-2023 (inclusive).
6) Consent data
The consents dataset describes consent to linkage, and is current at the time of deposit
CLS/ NHS Digital Sub-licence agreement
NHS Digital has given CLS permission for onward sharing of the Next Steps/HES dataset via the UKDS Secure Lab. In order to ensure data minimisation, NHS Digital requires that researchers only access the HES variables needed for their approved research project. Therefore, the HES linked data provided by the UKDS to approved researchers will be subject to sub-setting of variables. The researcher will need to request a specific sub-set of variables from the Next Steps HES data dictionary, which will subsequently make available within their UKDS Secure Account. Once the researcher has finished their research, the UKDS will delete the tailored dataset for that specific project.

Any party wishing to access the data deposited at the UK Data Service will be required to enter into a Licence agreement with CLS (UCL), in addition to the agreements signed with the UKDS, provided in the application pack.

The Licensee shall acknowledge in any publication, whether printed, electronic or broadcast, based wholly or in part on such materials, both the source of the data and UCL.

 The 1970 British Cohort Study Deaths Dataset, 1970-2014: Special Licence Access contains data on known deaths among members of the BCS70 birth cohort from 1970 to 2014. Information on deaths has been taken from the records maintained by the organisations responsible for the study over the lifetime of the study - the National Birthday Trust Fund, the National Children’s Bureau (NCB), the  SSRU and the CLS. The information has been gleaned from a variety of sources, including death certificates and other information from the National Health Service Central Register (NHSCR), and from relatives and friends during survey activities and cohort maintenance work by telephone, letter and e-mail. It includes all deaths up to 31st December 2014. In only 40 cases are the date of death unknown. By the end of December 8.7 per cent of the cohort were known to have died.

The 1970 British Cohort Study Response Dataset, 1970-2012 (SN 5641) covers other responses and outcomes of the cohort members and should be used alongside this dataset. In April 2025, the user guide for SN 5641 was added to this study to replace the previous one, at the depositor's request.
