The surveys, conducted in 1993, 2000, 2007, and 2014, aim to provide comprehensive data on the mental health status of the adult population, track changes over time, and evaluate the use of mental health services. The APMS covers a wide range of mental health conditions, including common mental disorders, psychotic disorders, and substance use disorders, among others. It also examines factors such as socio-demographic characteristics, physical health, and lifestyle behaviors that may influence mental health. The findings from the APMS are crucial for policymakers, healthcare providers, and researchers to understand the burden of mental illness, plan services, and develop interventions to improve mental health outcomes in England."}}]]
