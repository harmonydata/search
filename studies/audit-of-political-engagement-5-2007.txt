1d:T71c,The Audit of Political Engagement is a time-series study providing an annual benchmark to measure political engagement in Great Britain, gauging public opinion about politics and the political system, and more broadly the general health of our democracy. Each Audit report presents the findings from a public opinion survey, providing detailed commentary on a range of measures that have been chosen as key measures of political engagement. Repeating questions in successive years enables us to chronicle the public’s responses year on year and track the direction and magnitude of change since the Audit was first published in 2004, building trend data on public attitudes to key aspects of our democracy. 

The Audit looks at core inter-locking areas that are known as vital facets, or 'building blocks', of political engagement. Given the multi-dimensional nature of political engagement, the indicators chosen are not exhaustive, but in capturing aspects of public behaviour, knowledge, opinions, attitudes and values towards politics they help us understand the drivers of political engagement and the relationships between them. Across the Audit series several 'core' indicator questions have been asked each year, supplemented by a range of thematic and topical questions, some of which are re-visited on two- or three-year cycles.

Further information about the survey series is available from the Hansard Society Audit of Political Engagement webpages.

Audit of Political Engagement 5, 2007 provides an update of the six core indicators. Previous surveys were based on UK data, whereas figures from 2007 are based on Great Britain and do not include Northern Ireland.

For the second edition (November 2009), a new version of the data file has been deposited which includes an urban-rural indicator variable.1b:["$","$6",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":["$","$L1c",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Audit of Political Engagement 5, 2007","description":"$1d","url":["https://datacatalogue.ukdataservice.ac.uk/studies/study/5992"],"keywords":["ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY","AGE","CARS","CHILDREN","COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION","DEBILITATIVE ILLNESS","DECENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT","DIGITAL TELEVISION","ECONOMIC ACTIVITY","ELECTION CAMPAIGNS","ELECTORAL SYSTEMS","ELECTORAL VOTING","ELECTORS","EMPLOYMENT","ETHNIC GROUPS","EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT","EUROPEAN UNION","FUND-RAISING","GENDER","HOUSEHOLDS","HOUSING TENURE","INCOME","INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL","INTERNET USE","LEGISLATURE","LOCAL GOVERNMENT","LOCAL GOVERNMENT CANDIDATES","LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS","MARITAL STATUS","MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT","MOBILE COMMUNICATION","MOBILE PHONES","NATIONAL ELECTIONS","NATIONALITY","NEWSPAPER READERSHIP","NON-VIOLENT PROTESTS","PETITIONING","POLITICAL ALLEGIANCE","POLITICAL ATTITUDES","POLITICAL AWARENESS","POLITICAL INTEREST","POLITICAL OPPOSITION","POLITICAL PARTICIPATION","QUALIFICATIONS","RADIO LISTENING","RURAL AREAS","SATISFACTION","SELF-EMPLOYED","SOCIAL CLASS","SOCIAL PROTEST","STRIKES","TELEPHONES","TRUST IN GOVERNMENT","URBAN AREAS","VOLUNTARY WORK","VOTING","VOTING BEHAVIOUR","VOTING INTENTION"],"identifier":["10.5255/UKDA-SN-5992-1"],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UK Data Service","url":"https://datacatalogue.ukdataservice.ac.uk/studies/study/5992"}],"sponsor":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"House of Commons Library"},{"@type":"Organization","name":"Ministry of Justice"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"Hansard Society, Parliament and Government Programme"}],"temporalCoverage":"2007-11-01T00:00:00Z/2007-12-01T00:00:00Z"},"extra_data":{"end_year":2007,"top_level_ancestor_uuid":"00235f652796471205bc99f3bef90f04","data_access":"The Data Collection is to be made available to any user without the requirement for registration for download/access under an\nOpen Government Licence.","sex":"all","slug":"audit-of-political-engagement-5-2007","resource_type":"study","harmony_id":"ukds/audit-of-political-engagement-5-2007","study_design":[],"genetic_data_collected":false,"urls":["https://datacatalogue.ukdataservice.ac.uk/studies/study/5992"],"geographic_coverage":"Great Britain","num_variables":null,"country_codes":["GB"],"name":"Audit of Political Engagement 5, 2007","duration_years":null,"instruments":[],"dois":["10.5255/UKDA-SN-5992-1"],"ai_summary":"","language_codes":["en"],"source":["ukds"],"start_year":2007,"uuid":"00235f652796471205bc99f3bef90f04"},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"child_datasets":[{"dataset_schema":{},"extra_data":{"slug":"5992-ape5-spss-data-inc-urbanity","end_year":2007,"resource_type":"dataset","name":"5992_ape5-spss-data_inc_urbanity","num_variables":198,"start_year":2007,"uuid":"c6ca05657ad335ca18cc423283d8d0e8"},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]}],"num_descendant_variables":198},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":true}]}]

1e:T71c,The Audit of Political Engagement is a time-series study providing an annual benchmark to measure political engagement in Great Britain, gauging public opinion about politics and the political system, and more broadly the general health of our democracy. Each Audit report presents the findings from a public opinion survey, providing detailed commentary on a range of measures that have been chosen as key measures of political engagement. Repeating questions in successive years enables us to chronicle the public’s responses year on year and track the direction and magnitude of change since the Audit was first published in 2004, building trend data on public attitudes to key aspects of our democracy. 

The Audit looks at core inter-locking areas that are known as vital facets, or 'building blocks', of political engagement. Given the multi-dimensional nature of political engagement, the indicators chosen are not exhaustive, but in capturing aspects of public behaviour, knowledge, opinions, attitudes and values towards politics they help us understand the drivers of political engagement and the relationships between them. Across the Audit series several 'core' indicator questions have been asked each year, supplemented by a range of thematic and topical questions, some of which are re-visited on two- or three-year cycles.

Further information about the survey series is available from the Hansard Society Audit of Political Engagement webpages.

Audit of Political Engagement 5, 2007 provides an update of the six core indicators. Previous surveys were based on UK data, whereas figures from 2007 are based on Great Britain and do not include Northern Ireland.

For the second edition (November 2009), a new version of the data file has been deposited which includes an urban-rural indicator variable.1f:T71c,The Audit of Political Engagement is a time-series study providing an annual benchmark to measure political engagement in Great Britain, gauging public opinion about politics and the political system, and more broadly the general health of our democracy.
