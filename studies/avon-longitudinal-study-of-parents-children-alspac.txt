It aims to explore the multitude of factors affecting health and development throughout life. The study began by enrolling over 14,000 pregnant women from the Avon area in the UK between April 1991 and December 1992. These women, their children, and partners have been extensively followed for more than 20 years.

ALSPAC examines a wide array of genetic, epigenetic, biological, psychological, social, and environmental factors and their impact on various health, social, and developmental outcomes. The study's longitudinal design allows researchers to investigate how early life exposures influence health and development later in life. It has contributed significantly to understanding the complex interactions between genetics and environment in shaping health trajectories. The data collected has been pivotal in numerous research publications, influencing public health policies and practices.16:T8e9,The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, and also known as the 'Children of the 90s' study), which is based at the University of Bristol, is an ongoing longitudinal study of a population of children born to mothers resident in one geographic area in England. The overall objectives of the study are to understand the ways in which the physical and social environments interact over time with genetic inheritance to affect health, behaviour and development in infancy, childhood and then into adulthood. Information has been collected at regular and frequent intervals from pregnancy and throughout childhood concerning the child's physical environments, parental characteristics (including economic and educational indicators), social circumstances, and family relationships. ALSPAC recruited more than 14,000 pregnant women with estimated dates of delivery between April 1991 and December 1992, who were living in the Avon Health Authority area, to take part in the study.  These women, the children arising from the index pregnancy and the women's partners have been followed up since then and detailed data collected throughout childhood.

The datasets held at the UKDA are sampler datasets, and have been compiled using various questionnaire and assessment data from the ALSPAC study. Further information may be found in the documentation, and for the wider study, on the ALSPAC web site.

 The ALSPAC study collects data using a variety of methods, including:self-completion questionnaires completed by the child's motherself-completion questionnaires completed by the mother’s partnerassays of biological samples, including geneticsmedical recordseducational recordsinformation from teachers and head teachersself-completion questionnaires completed by the study childhands-on assessmentsFor the UKDA sampler datasets I-IV and VI (covering household, neighbourhood, housing, social/economic and employment/occupational information), data from the mothers' and partners' questionnaires were used, and for dataset V (height), data from the hands-on assessments were included. These files include data gathered between 1990 and 2003 only.

Further details may be found in the documentation, and the ALSPAC questionnaires may be found on the study web site.17:T5bf,CLOSER (Cohort and Longitudinal Studies Enhancement Resources) aims to maximise the use, value and impact of longitudinal studies, both at home and abroad. Bringing together leading UK longitudinal studies, the British Library and the UK Data Service, CLOSER works to stimulate interdisciplinary research, develop shared resources, provide training, and share expertise. Resources available from CLOSER include harmonised datasets (developed to facilitate cross-study comparisons) and CLOSER Discovery (a search engine that enables researchers to search and browse questionnaires and data from different longitudinal studies). CLOSER’s website also includes a range of training materials focused on longitudinal studies and data. CLOSER is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and is based at the UCL Institute of Education.CLOSER Work Package 20 has generated harmonised measures of mental health at age 10/11 in the National Child Development Study (NCDS), 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), and the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS).

The Harmonised Mental Health Measures at Age 10/11 in Selected British Cohorts: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children: Special Licence Access provides the harmonised data on mental health for ALSPAC.
