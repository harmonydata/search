The study aims to investigate the complex interplay of genetic, nutritional, environmental, behavioral, and social factors on health and development from childhood into adulthood, particularly within a deprived, multi-ethnic population. Bradford, known for its ethnic diversity and socio-economic challenges, provides a unique setting for this research.

The study recruited over 13,500 pregnant women, resulting in a cohort of more than 13,800 children. Data collection includes detailed health assessments, biological samples, and comprehensive questionnaires covering a wide range of topics such as diet, lifestyle, and socio-economic status. The study also incorporates data from health records and educational assessments.

Key findings from BiB have highlighted significant health disparities linked to socio-economic and ethnic factors. For instance, the study has provided insights into the prevalence of childhood obesity, asthma, and developmental disorders, and how these are influenced by early-life exposures and family background. The research has also contributed to understanding the impact of maternal health and behavior on child outcomes.

The significance of the BiB study lies in its potential to inform public health interventions and policies aimed at improving health outcomes in similar populations. By identifying modifiable risk factors and protective factors, the study supports efforts to reduce health inequalities and promote healthier communities.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Born in Bradford (BiB)","description":"Born in Bradford (BIB) is a large birth cohort study based at Bradford Royal Infirmary, a hospital in the city of Bradford, West Yorkshire.
