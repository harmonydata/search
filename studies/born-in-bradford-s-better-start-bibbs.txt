life interventions using efficient study designs. Better Start Bradford (BSB) has been allocated £49 million from the Big Lottery Fund to implement 22 interventions to improve outcomes for children aged 0–3 in three deprived and ethnically diverse inner-city areas of Bradford. BiBBS aims to evaluate the effects of these interventions on social and emotional development, communication and language development, and nutrition and obesity by following families from pregnancy into childhood and using linkage to routinely collected data.","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/BiBBS.png","publisher":{"name":"National Health Service (NHS)","url":"$undefined","logo":"$undefined"},"funders":[{"name":"BLF","url":"$undefined","logo":"$undefined"}],"geographicCoverage":"GB","temporalCoverage":"2016/2016","ageCoverage":"$undefined","studyDesign":["birth","cohort","longitudinal"],"resourceType":"study","topics":["Covid-19 data collection","Biomarkers","Diet and nutrition","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Language and literacy","Loneliness and social isolation","Migration and immigration","Neighbourhood","Physical health assessment","Work and employment","Parenting and family","Social care - receipt","Social care - need"],"instruments":["GAD-7 Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (7-item) (GAD-7)","EQ-5D-5L (Descriptive system only) (5-item)","Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (5-item + 5-item impact supplement) (SDQ)","Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (7-item) (GAD-7)","Paternal Antenatal Attachment Scale (1-item only) (PAAS)","Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (14-item) (WEMWBS)","Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale (17-items only) (MAAS)","Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (7-item) (SWEMWBS)","Patient Health Questionnaire (8-item + impact question) (PHQ-8)"],"dataCatalogs":[{"name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=BiBBS","logo":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"}],"matchedVariables":[],"allVariables":[{"name":"Often complains of headaches, stomach-aches or sickness","options":["Q1-5","Not true","Somewhat true","Always true","Impact Supplement 1","Yes - minor difficulties","Yes - definite difficulties","Yes - severe difficulties","No","Impact Supplement 2","Less than 1 month","1-5 months","6-12 months","Over a year","Impact Supplement 3-5","Not at all","Only a little","Quite a lot","A great deal"]},{"name":"Many worries, often seems worried","options":["Q1-5","Not true","Somewhat true","Always true","Impact Supplement 1","Yes - minor difficulties","Yes - definite difficulties","Yes - severe difficulties","No","Impact Supplement 2","Less than 1 month","1-5 months","6-12 months","Over a year","Impact Supplement 3-5","Not at all","Only a little","Quite a lot","A great deal"]},{"name":"Often unhappy, down-hearted or tearful","options":["Q1-5","Not true","Somewhat true","Always true","Impact Supplement 1","Yes - minor difficulties","Yes - definite difficulties","Yes - severe difficulties","No","Impact Supplement 2","Less than 1 month","1-5 months","6-12 months","Over a year","Impact Supplement 3-5","Not at all","Only a little","Quite a lot","A great deal"]},{"name":"Nervous or clingy in new situations, easily loses confidence","options":["Q1-5","Not true","Somewhat true","Always true","Impact Supplement 1","Yes - minor difficulties","Yes - definite difficulties","Yes - severe difficulties","No","Impact Supplement 2","Less than 1 month","1-5 months","6-12 months","Over a year","Impact Supplement 3-5","Not at all","Only a little","Quite a lot","A great deal"]},{"name":"Many fears, easily scared","options":["Q1-5","Not true","Somewhat true","Always true","Impact Supplement 1","Yes - minor difficulties","Yes - definite difficulties","Yes - severe difficulties","No","Impact Supplement 2","Less than 1 month","1-5 months","6-12 months","Over a year","Impact Supplement 3-5","Not at all","Only a little","Quite a lot","A great deal"]},{"name":"IS 1.

in Bradford’s Better Start (BiBBS) is an experimental birth cohort study designed to evaluate the impact of early life interventions on child development outcomes. Funded with £49 million from the Big Lottery Fund, the study focuses on three deprived and ethnically diverse inner-city areas of Bradford. The project implements 22 interventions aimed at improving outcomes for children aged 0–3, specifically targeting social and emotional development, communication and language development, and nutrition and obesity. BiBBS follows families from pregnancy into childhood, utilizing efficient study designs and linking to routinely collected data to assess the effectiveness of these interventions. The study's innovative approach allows for the simultaneous evaluation of multiple interventions, providing valuable insights into early childhood development and the potential for improving outcomes in disadvantaged communities."}}]]
