Better Start Bradford (BSB) has been allocated £49 million from the Big Lottery Fund to implement 22 interventions to improve outcomes for children aged 0–3 in three deprived and ethnically diverse inner-city areas of Bradford. BiBBS aims to evaluate the effects of these interventions on social and emotional development, communication and language development, and nutrition and obesity by following families from pregnancy into childhood and using linkage to routinely collected data.","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/BiBBS.png","publisher":{"name":"National Health Service (NHS)","url":"$undefined","logo":"$undefined"},"funders":[{"name":"BLF","url":"$undefined","logo":"$undefined"}],"geographicCoverage":"GB","temporalCoverage":"2016/2016","ageCoverage":"$undefined","studyDesign":["longitudinal","cohort","birth"],"resourceType":"study","topics":["Covid-19 data collection","Biomarkers","Diet and nutrition","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Language and literacy","Loneliness and social isolation","Migration and immigration","Neighbourhood","Physical health assessment","Work and employment","Parenting and family","Social care - receipt","Social care - need"],"instruments":["Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale (17-items only) (MAAS)","Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (7-item) (SWEMWBS)","Patient Health Questionnaire (8-item + impact question) (PHQ-8)","GAD-7 Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (7-item) (GAD-7)","EQ-5D-5L (Descriptive system only) (5-item)","Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (14-item) (WEMWBS)","Paternal Antenatal Attachment Scale (1-item only) (PAAS)","Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (5-item + 5-item impact supplement) (SDQ)","Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (7-item) (GAD-7)"],"dataCatalogs":[{"name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=BiBBS","logo":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"}],"matchedVariables":[{"name":"I have had the desire to read about or get information about the developing baby.
