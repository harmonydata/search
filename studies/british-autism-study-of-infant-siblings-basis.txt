The study primarily examines infants who have older siblings diagnosed with autism, as these infants are considered to have a higher genetic predisposition to the condition. BASIS employs innovative techniques to study both brain and behavioral development in these infants, aiming to identify early markers or differences in development compared to infants without a familial history of autism.

The study's methodology involves tracking the developmental trajectories of these infants over time, using a combination of neuroimaging, behavioral assessments, and other developmental measures. This approach allows researchers to observe potential early signs of autism and understand how these may differ from typical developmental patterns.

Key findings from BASIS have contributed to the understanding of early developmental differences in infants at risk for autism, including variations in social attention, sensory processing, and motor development. These insights are crucial for developing early intervention strategies and improving outcomes for children with autism.

Additionally, the study has expanded its scope to include infants at elevated likelihood for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), recognizing the overlap and co-occurrence of these neurodevelopmental conditions. This extension aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the early developmental pathways that may lead to autism, ADHD, or both.

Overall, BASIS is a pivotal study in the field of autism research, offering valuable insights into the early developmental stages of children at risk and informing both clinical practice and policy regarding early diagnosis and intervention.c:[["$","$L14",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$15"}}],["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":["$","$L16",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"British Autism Study of Infant Siblings (BASIS)","description":"The British Autism Study of Infant Siblings (BASIS) is a prospective longitudinal study of infants at elevated likelihood for autism in the UK.
