The study's primary aim was to explore the development of delinquent and criminal behavior, examining factors that could predict such behavior and understanding why delinquency starts and persists or ceases into adulthood. The CSDD sought to investigate the continuity of behavioral development, the impact of life events, and the prediction of future behavior. Rather than testing a single theory, the study aimed to evaluate multiple hypotheses regarding the causes and correlates of offending. Over the years, the CSDD has provided valuable insights into the life-course development of criminal behavior, highlighting the importance of early life experiences, family background, and social influences. Its findings have been influential in shaping policies and interventions aimed at preventing delinquency and supporting at-risk youth.","country_codes":["GB"],"resource_type":"study","language_codes":["en"],"geographic_coverage":"England","genetic_data_collected":false,"uuid":"cbcba21329e7ee1f0cc98b9d89d2dbd0","number_of_variables":401},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"variables_which_matched":"$undefined"},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":false}]}]]
