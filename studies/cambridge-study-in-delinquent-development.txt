The CSDD investigates the continuity of behavioral development, the impact of life events, and the prediction of future behavior. It is notable for not adhering to a single theory of delinquency but rather testing multiple hypotheses regarding the causes and correlates of offending. Over the years, the study has provided valuable insights into the life-course development of criminal behavior, highlighting the influence of family, social, and individual factors on delinquency. Its findings have been instrumental in shaping policies and interventions aimed at preventing criminal behavior.","sample_size":411,"name":"The Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development","num_variables":30,"country_codes":["GB"],"dois":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s40865-021-00162-y"],"urls":["https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=CSDD","http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/People/professor-david-farrington"],"source":["mhc"],"geographic_coverage":"England","resource_type":"study","genetic_data_collected":false,"start_year":1961,"language_codes":["en"],"instruments":["Short New Junior Maudsley Inventory (12-item)","CAGE questionnaire (4-item)","Big Five Inventory (44-item) (BFI)","General Health Questionnaire (30-item) (GHQ-30)","Eysenck's Personality Inventory (57-item) (EPI)","Hare Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (12-item) (PCL:SV)"],"slug":"cambridge-study-in-delinquent-development","harmony_id":"mhc/csdd","data_access":"Contact David Farringdon by emailing dpf1@cam.ac.uk to express an interest in accessing the data","age_lower":8,"end_year":2004,"uuid":"cbcba21329e7ee1f0cc98b9d89d2dbd0","number_of_variables":58},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"variables_which_matched":"$undefined"},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":false}]]
