Approximately 8,500 families were invited to take part with boosted representation from families in the lowest quintile of disadvantage.The first wave of data collection took place when the cohort child was nine months old (Wave 1). Subsequent surveys are taking place annually.Data collection includes assessments of:The Age 9 Months and Age 3 Sweeps were carried out face-to-face. The sweeps at ages 2, 4 and 5 will be administered using a sequential mixed mode design with online and telephone surveys.The study includes ongoing linkages to both parent and baby education and health records.Alongside the main surveys and linkages, the study will collect additional data using an innovative smartphone app called BabySteps. BabySteps will enable us to capture rich developmental and home environment measures between study sweeps at low cost. Measures will include a combination of short questionnaires and video/audio recordings.
