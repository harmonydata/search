																											Lisa is a Professor of Survey Research.16:T5c5,The Children of the 2020s study is a nationally representative birth cohort study in England, focusing on babies born at the start of the 2020s. Commissioned by the Department for Education, the study aims to explore the family, early education, and childcare factors that influence early school success. Led by Professor Pasco Fearon, the study involves collaboration with several institutions, including UCL, the University of Cambridge, and Ipsos.

The study's sample is drawn from HMRC Child Benefit records, targeting babies born in September, October, and November 2021, with approximately 8,500 families invited to participate. It is a five-wave longitudinal survey tracking children from nine months to five years old. The first wave of data collection occurred when the children were nine months old, with subsequent waves planned at ages two, three, four, and five.

Data collection methods include face-to-face interviews, online and telephone surveys, and the use of a smartphone app called BabySteps to gather developmental and home environment data. The study also plans to link survey data with education and health records, with participants' consent.

The study's findings are expected to provide valuable insights into early childhood development and inform policy decisions related to education and childcare. Data from the study is available for research purposes through the ONS Secure Research Service, and researchers must become accredited to access it.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Children of the 2020s study","description":"$15","url":["https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/children-of-the-2020s-study/"],"keywords":[],"identifier":[],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies","url":"https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/"}],"keywords_automatically_imputed":["Cognitive measures","Victimisation and life events","Social care - need"]},"extra_data":{"study_design":["administrative","survey","panel","cohort","birth","geo","longitudinal"],"urls":["https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/children-of-the-2020s-study/"],"sex":"all","duration_years":null,"ai_summary":"$16","name":"Children of the 2020s study","num_variables":null,"country_codes":["UK"],"language_codes":["en"],"dois":[],"genetic_data_collected":false,"geographic_coverage":"","resource_type":"study","source":["cls"],"start_year":null,"instruments":[],"slug":"children-of-the-2020s-study","end_year":null,"data_access":null,"harmony_id":"cls/children-of-the-2020s-study","uuid":"df357ed8b40ea4cb4816514318e5c52b"},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":true}]]

BabySteps will enable us to capture rich developmental and home environment measures between study waves at low cost. Measures will include a combination of short questionnaires and video/audio recordings.High quality, cleaned, and fully weighted datasets, along with data documentation and guidance following each wave of data collection will be produced, alongside non-response analyses and details of the weighting system applied.The Children of the 2020s study receives funding from the Department for Education.If you’ve been contacted to take part in the Children of the 2020s study, please head to the study website at children2020s.ipsos.com to find out more about what’s involved.A nationally representative sample of approximately 8,500 babies has been recruited from across England, with boosted representation of babies in the lowest quintile of disadvantage. We are surveying participants annually.
