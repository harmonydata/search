As the largest provider of secondary mental healthcare in Europe, SLaM's records provide a comprehensive resource for mental health research. The CRIS system is utilized by researchers at the NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) to access and analyze this rich dataset. A key feature of CRIS is its Natural Language Processing (NLP) Service, which allows researchers to effectively use and analyze free text responses within electronic health records. This capability significantly enhances the depth and scope of research that can be conducted, enabling more nuanced insights into mental health conditions and treatments. The CRIS system thus plays a crucial role in advancing mental health research by providing a robust platform for data analysis and integration.c:[["$","$L14",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$15"}}],["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":["$","$L16",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS)","description":"The Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system is a database and computer system that links administrative records of individuals who have accessed the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust, the largest provider of secondary mental healthcare in Europe, with other administrative data. \n\nThis linkage generates a cohort with rich data and enables researchers at the NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) to derive and analyse these data.
