Cognitive Function and Ageing Study Wales (CFAS Wales) is a longitudinal research project focused on understanding health and cognitive function among older adults in Wales. It is part of the broader Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS) collaboration. CFAS Wales aims to identify biomarkers and early indicators of cognitive decline, utilizing methods such as imaging. A unique aspect of this study is its investigation into factors that might delay the onset of dementia, with particular attention to the potential protective effects of bilingualism and the influence of social networks. Additionally, CFAS Wales seeks to explore the differences in cognitive aging between rural and urban populations, addressing gaps left by previous research. The study's findings are significant for developing strategies to mitigate cognitive decline and improve the quality of life for older adults."}}]]
