1f:T68b,In 2012, the Informed Decisions for Action in Maternal and Newborn Health (IDEAS) project, based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, collected data to answer the following research question: In Uttar Pradesh in India, Ethiopia, and Gombe state in Nigeria, where innovations to enhance frequency and quality of health care for mothers and newborns are in place, is there evidence to suggest that increases in frequency and quality of health care were linked to increases in the coverage of interventions that save maternal and newborn lives?"

Applying a cluster household survey design in the defined geographies, individual level data were collected in May (Ethiopia), June (Nigeria) and November (India) 2012.  Women aged 13-49 years, who had had a live birth in the 12 months prior to survey, were asked a detailed set of questions about behaviours and practices during that pregnancy, birth, and during the first month of newborn life. From these data it is possible to answer questions about frequency and content of care along the continuum from pregnancy to newborn care in three high mortality settings where commitments are currently in place to improve health outcomes.

The data held at the UK Data Archive are an extract from a larger household dataset that recorded information about the knowledge of danger signs, experience of danger signs, access to health care, and costs of accessing care for individual women, and the characteristics of the households they were resident in. Further information on the project and findings for each country may be found on the IDEAS Resources webpages.20:T68b,In 2012, the Informed Decisions for Action in Maternal and Newborn Health (IDEAS) project, based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, collected data to answer the following research question: In Uttar Pradesh in India, Ethiopia, and Gombe state in Nigeria, where innovations to enhance frequency and quality of health care for mothers and newborns are in place, is there evidence to suggest that increases in frequency and quality of health care were linked to increases in the coverage of interventions that save maternal and newborn lives?"
