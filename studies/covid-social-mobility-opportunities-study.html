COSMO was initially funded by UK Research and Innovation, with a second wave of data collection funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.To learn more about COSMO, or if you are are a participant, please visit the COSMO website.Professor Emla Fitzsimons appointed new CLS director13 November 2025Invitation to join CLS Scientific Advisory Network21 October 2025New data release: COSMO Wave 221 November 2023COSMO recruited more than 13,000 young people who were in Year 11 in 2020-21. It used an area-stratified random probability sample from the National Pupil Database.The study oversampled young people from disadvantaged, ethnic minority and other often-excluded groups to ensure it reflected the full range of experiences of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Sutton Trust commissioned an additional boost sample of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who showed academic potential before the pandemic, to look in more depth at the impact on their chances for social mobility.There were two waves of data collection between 2021 to 2023. Full details of the content of each wave, including young person and parent questionnaires, are available on the COSMO study website.Wave 1 was an online survey covering:Wave 2 used a web-first approach, with face-to-face, telephone and further online follow-up.

In addition to leading the COSMO study, Jake’s other work includes research projects for multiple UK government departments, such as work for the Department for Education into the transition from education into work, as well as leading multiple randomised evaluations, such as Education Endowment Foundation-funded work focused on improving teachers’ use of formative assessment. His doctoral research consisted of three linked studies considering aspects of socio-economic inequality in access to higher education in England, considering both the point of entry to university but also its precursors.Lisa CalderwoodProfessor of Survey Research, CLS Managing Director, Co-Director of Generation New Era and Director of GUIDEAlissa GoodmanProfessor of Economics and Co-Director of Generation New EraPraveetha PatalayProfessor of Population Health and WellbeingSubscribe to our newslettersSubscribe to our regular newsletters for the latest data releases, training events, research and other news from CLS and our cohort studies.Centre for Longitudinal Studies
