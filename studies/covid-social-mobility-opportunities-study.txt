London WC1H 0ALEmail: clsdata@ucl.ac.ukOn this page:18:T5da,The COVID Social Mobility & Opportunities study (COSMO) is a comprehensive national cohort study involving over 12,000 young people in England who were in Year 11 during the 2020-21 academic year. It aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on educational inequality and social mobility. The study is a collaboration between the UCL Centre for Education Policy & Equalising Opportunities, the Sutton Trust, and the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS), with funding from UK Research and Innovation and the Economic and Social Research Council.

COSMO is notable for being the largest study of its kind, utilizing an area-stratified random probability sample from the National Pupil Database. It oversampled disadvantaged, ethnic minority, and other often-excluded groups to capture a wide range of pandemic experiences. Additionally, the Sutton Trust commissioned a boost sample focusing on disadvantaged young people with academic potential to explore the pandemic's impact on their social mobility prospects.

The study conducted two waves of data collection from 2021 to 2023. Wave 1 was an online survey, while Wave 2 employed a web-first approach with face-to-face, telephone, and online follow-ups. The data and documentation from COSMO are accessible through the UK Data Service. The study's findings are expected to provide valuable insights into the pandemic's effects on educational and social outcomes, informing policies and interventions aimed at reducing inequalities.c:[["$","$L14",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$15"}}],["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":["$","$L16",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"COVID Social Mobility & Opportunities Study","description":"$17","url":["https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/cosmo/"],"keywords":[],"identifier":[],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies","url":"https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/"}]},"extra_data":{"language_codes":["en"],"start_year":null,"harmony_id":"cls/covid-social-mobility-opportunities-study","end_year":null,"data_access":null,"urls":["https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/cosmo/"],"geographic_coverage":"","name":"COVID Social Mobility & Opportunities Study","genetic_data_collected":false,"num_variables":null,"slug":"covid-social-mobility-opportunities-study","dois":[],"sex":"all","study_design":["cohort","survey","longitudinal"],"instruments":[],"ai_summary":"$18","resource_type":"study","country_codes":["UK"],"source":["cls"],"duration_years":null,"uuid":"b0a525a0378b9b6410e9283c7e94a068"},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":true}]}]]
