Initiated in 2002-2003, the study recruited over 6,000 participants aged 11-13 from 51 secondary schools. The primary aim is to explore how these factors contribute to ethnic disparities in health outcomes during adolescence and their potential long-term effects into adulthood.

The DASH study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data collection through surveys and physical measurements with qualitative interviews to gain a comprehensive understanding of the participants' social environments and health behaviors. Key areas of investigation include mental health, physical activity, diet, and the impact of socio-economic status and neighborhood characteristics.

Findings from the DASH study have highlighted significant ethnic differences in health behaviors and outcomes, such as variations in physical activity levels, dietary habits, and mental health status. The study has also underscored the importance of considering both social and biological determinants when addressing health disparities.

The significance of the DASH study lies in its contribution to public health policy and interventions aimed at reducing health inequalities. By identifying the factors that contribute to ethnic differences in health during adolescence, the study provides valuable insights for developing targeted strategies to improve health outcomes for diverse populations.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Determinants of Adolescent Social Wellbeing & Health (DASH)","description":"The Determinants of Adolescent Social Wellbeing & Health (DASH) study is a multi-ethnic adolescent cohort study in inner-London investigating social and biological influences on ethnic differences in health and wellbeing in adolescence.
