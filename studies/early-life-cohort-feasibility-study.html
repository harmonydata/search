We will publish our findings here soon. In the meantime, we are delighted that the Economic and Social Research Council have agreed to fund a main study and have invited us to apply for the funding as a sole applicant. We look forward to submitting our proposal.The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study collected data on a new generation of UK-born babies in their first year of life. It captured information about their economic and social environments, and their health, wellbeing and development.The main aim of the project is to test the feasibility of sampling and recruitment for an innovative new UK-wide birth cohort study. However, the data from the feasibility study itself will also be made available to the research and policy community.The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study aims to paint a nationally representative picture of the circumstances and lives of a new cohort of babies born at a critical time in the UK’s history.With the economic and social repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impacts of Brexit on our economy and society still unknown, the need to understand the challenges facing this generation of babies, their development as children and their future prospects is pressing.The primary scientific aim of the study is to understand how inequalities in early child development are changing over time, and to learn whether the social and biological factors driving these trajectories are evolving.The key scientific themes include:The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study draws a nationally representative sample of babies born in a two-month period from all four UK nations. In England, Wales and Scotland the babies were born in November and December 2022, and in Northern Ireland the babies were born in June and July 2023. Interviews took place when the babies were around 9-12 months old.In England, Wales and Scotland, families were first contacted in July 2023 and fieldwork finished by the end of June 2024. In Northern Ireland, families were first contacted in February 2024 and fieldwork finished in September 2024.In total, 1,918 families took part:1,850 mums and 1,256 dads took part.The data will be available from the UK Data Service in 2025.Data collection involved interviews with mothers and fathers. Saliva samples from parents and infants for DNA extraction were collected from an experimental sub-group to test the impact on participation.The feasibility of innovative measures to capture babies’ development was also tested. These comprise neuro scientific measures (looking-time task, eye tracking, mobile EEG to measure brain activity, together with use of an actimetry device), and measurement of the early language environment (through placement in the home of a LENA recording device).We also tested additional infant biosamples (hair samples) and infant anthropometry (weight, length, head circumference and adiposity). The feasibility of collecting these specialist objective measurements using trained fieldwork agency staff was assessed via small scale field tests, separate to the main data collection.The study design will enable linkage to electronic and other administrative records of babies and parents as well as to geo-environmental data, which can provide information on environmental and other conditions in the places they spend time, including homes, childcare locations, and hospitals.Parents were asked about their baby’s health and growth, behaviour and development, sleep, diet and activities they do with their child. They were also asked about their home and family, including other children and their partner/other parent, their work situation and family finances, health and wellbeing, parenting approach and relationship with their baby, relationship support and services received, and childcare arrangements.Both mothers and fathers were invited to interview, including those who live apart from their child’s other parent. Each parent was interviewed separately.One parent was asked to complete a 60-minute interview in person with an interviewer. This longer interview was recommended for the parent who spends the most time with the baby. In most families, this was the child’s mother. There were options to complete the interview by telephone and by video call if an in-person interview was not possible.The other parent living with the baby, usually the child’s father, was asked to complete a 30-minute interview, either in-person with an interviewer or online. This interview was shorter because some questions only need to be asked once per baby or per household.Parents who lived apart from their baby, usually the fathers, were asked to complete a separate 40-minute interview. This interview could also be completed by telephone or by video call.Resident partners of parents, including those who live apart from the baby, were also invited to be interviewed.When no parents took part at an address, an invite was sent for one parent to take part in a 40-minute non-response web survey.Download the Early Life Cohort Study final questionnaire (February 2024, PDF)The study design focuses on maximising participation of traditionally ‘less often heard’ populations.In England, there were sample boosts for babies born into disadvantaged and ethnic minority families (Black Caribbean, Black African, Pakistani and Bangladeshi). There were further boosts of births in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We used experiments to test the effectiveness of different levels of incentives for taking part.We engaged fathers into the study, including those living in their own households.We have also worked with experts to understand how best to engage babies who are extremely vulnerable, including children born into care. Findings and recommendations from these expert discussions can be read in this Recommendations for next steps report (October 2024, PDF).The project team has undertaken careful public engagement with parents of children and young people to ensure acceptability of the proposed sampling, data collection and record linkage approaches. The public engagement was designed to enable individuals’ voices to be heard and acted upon in the design of the study, and to help ensure the study serves the needs of the people it represents.In addition, the project team has carried out extensive public engagement and consultation with policy and practitioner networks and with academic data users to determine evidence needs and scientific priorities for the feasibility study.Further information and reports can be found on our Public engagement page.Securing access to a high-quality sampling frame of babies born in all four UK countries is central to the feasibility study aims.We worked with agencies across the UK to develop applications to access centrally held records for this purpose, under appropriate governance mechanisms. Alongside this, we developed a programme of public engagement work to ensure public acceptability of our plans for sampling.Our preferred approach to use birth registrations, linked to NHS maternity records, has been successfully implemented in England, Wales and Scotland. In Northern Ireland, maternity records are used as the sampling frame.Birth registrations provide universal coverage of the population of babies, contain key characteristics of the baby, mother and father, including where they live, and may allow fathers resident at a different address to the baby to be recruited in their own right.NHS maternity records contain additional information which could be used for sampling, including the ethnic group of the baby, and facilitates timely access to updated addresses for any post-birth moves.Our approach was necessarily flexible and pragmatic in each UK nation, taking into account public views, as well as local processes and systems, logistics and governance around the implementation of an opt-out model of consent and timeliness.Different approval processes, data sources and sample provision in each UK nation has meant that the study started later in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales and Scotland.The study is designed for the public benefit, and our core values include a commitment to trustworthiness and transparency in the use of personal data, and enabling  individuals’ voices to be heard and acted upon.We have worked with families with children to co-design the study in way that allows participant voices from a diverse set of backgrounds to be heard.This included conducting qualitative research with parents who live apart from their children and parents from low-income families and minority ethnic families.The National Children’s Bureau and First 1001 Days Movement have supported a policy and practitioner consultation. We also consulted widely with data users from the academic, policy and third sectors.Find out more on the Public engagement page.An important aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of collecting biosamples and bio-measures.This includes saliva samples from both the infant and their parents for DNA extraction, in an experimental sub-group of the main survey.These measures will enable researchers to understand the interplay between biology and social environment on the developing child, including testing hypotheses relating to biological embedding of social adversity, mechanisms underlying resilience, and gene-environment interactions. The opportunity to fully genotype the cohort and natural parents before subsequent attrition takes place also brings strong methodological benefits.We randomised the DNA sample collection to a stratified sub-sample (about 600 issued sub-sample) to test whether this significantly impacts on successful recruitment into the study. Further, we tested levels and patterns of consent to provide DNA samples among those who did take part. The feasibility study also tested logistical factors in undertaking these collections at scale. We also tested sample storage and analysis options for the main study.We tested the feasibility of a number of novel approaches to data collection in the core domains of cognition, emotion, language, social development and the home and wider environment via small-scale field tests separate to the main survey.This included capture of neuro-cognitive function using direct assessment of neurocognitive development using habituation and looking-time-based methodologies. This was also supplemented with state of the art techniques such as eye-tracking and mobile EEG.We also explored the potential for using wearable and other devices to allow the passive collection of real-time behaviour through direct measurement. This included measuring the child’s linguistic environment (LENA system), activity level and physiology using wearable sensors.These small-scale field tests focused exclusively on the practical and training requirements for using these complex measurements in the context of a national cohort study. They also focused on the extent to which fieldworkers can be trained to successfully collect high-quality measurements in the home context.Administrative and geo-environmental linkages are embedded in the feasibility study from the outset.These will cover histories of the parents from before the pregnancy, plus pregnancy and birth records. Records will be linked from a constellation of agencies encountered by the baby and family, as the baby progresses through infancy and childhood.We asked permission to link administrative records for all participating parents and their child. We tested two models of consent and will initiate applications to link centrally held NHS health records. These would include:We also included consent for linkage to parental and child education records, and to social care records.

We look forward to submitting our proposal.The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study collected data on a new generation of UK-born babies in their first year of life. It captured information about their economic and social environments, and their health, wellbeing and development.The main aim of the project is to test the feasibility of sampling and recruitment for an innovative new UK-wide birth cohort study. However, the data from the feasibility study itself will also be made available to the research and policy community.The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study aims to paint a nationally representative picture of the circumstances and lives of a new cohort of babies born at a critical time in the UK’s history.With the economic and social repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impacts of Brexit on our economy and society still unknown, the need to understand the challenges facing this generation of babies, their development as children and their future prospects is pressing.The primary scientific aim of the study is to understand how inequalities in early child development are changing over time, and to learn whether the social and biological factors driving these trajectories are evolving.The key scientific themes include:The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study draws a nationally representative sample of babies born in a two-month period from all four UK nations. In England, Wales and Scotland the babies were born in November and December 2022, and in Northern Ireland the babies were born in June and July 2023. Interviews took place when the babies were around 9-12 months old.In England, Wales and Scotland, families were first contacted in July 2023 and fieldwork finished by the end of June 2024. In Northern Ireland, families were first contacted in February 2024 and fieldwork finished in September 2024.In total, 1,918 families took part:1,850 mums and 1,256 dads took part.The data will be available from the UK Data Service in 2025.Data collection involved interviews with mothers and fathers. Saliva samples from parents and infants for DNA extraction were collected from an experimental sub-group to test the impact on participation.The feasibility of innovative measures to capture babies’ development was also tested. These comprise neuro scientific measures (looking-time task, eye tracking, mobile EEG to measure brain activity, together with use of an actimetry device), and measurement of the early language environment (through placement in the home of a LENA recording device).We also tested additional infant biosamples (hair samples) and infant anthropometry (weight, length, head circumference and adiposity). The feasibility of collecting these specialist objective measurements using trained fieldwork agency staff was assessed via small scale field tests, separate to the main data collection.The study design will enable linkage to electronic and other administrative records of babies and parents as well as to geo-environmental data, which can provide information on environmental and other conditions in the places they spend time, including homes, childcare locations, and hospitals.Parents were asked about their baby’s health and growth, behaviour and development, sleep, diet and activities they do with their child. They were also asked about their home and family, including other children and their partner/other parent, their work situation and family finances, health and wellbeing, parenting approach and relationship with their baby, relationship support and services received, and childcare arrangements.Both mothers and fathers were invited to interview, including those who live apart from their child’s other parent. Each parent was interviewed separately.One parent was asked to complete a 60-minute interview in person with an interviewer. This longer interview was recommended for the parent who spends the most time with the baby. In most families, this was the child’s mother. There were options to complete the interview by telephone and by video call if an in-person interview was not possible.The other parent living with the baby, usually the child’s father, was asked to complete a 30-minute interview, either in-person with an interviewer or online. This interview was shorter because some questions only need to be asked once per baby or per household.Parents who lived apart from their baby, usually the fathers, were asked to complete a separate 40-minute interview. This interview could also be completed by telephone or by video call.Resident partners of parents, including those who live apart from the baby, were also invited to be interviewed.When no parents took part at an address, an invite was sent for one parent to take part in a 40-minute non-response web survey.Download the Early Life Cohort Study final questionnaire (February 2024, PDF)The study design focuses on maximising participation of traditionally ‘less often heard’ populations.In England, there were sample boosts for babies born into disadvantaged and ethnic minority families (Black Caribbean, Black African, Pakistani and Bangladeshi). There were further boosts of births in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We used experiments to test the effectiveness of different levels of incentives for taking part.We engaged fathers into the study, including those living in their own households.We have also worked with experts to understand how best to engage babies who are extremely vulnerable, including children born into care. Findings and recommendations from these expert discussions can be read in this Recommendations for next steps report (October 2024, PDF).The project team has undertaken careful public engagement with parents of children and young people to ensure acceptability of the proposed sampling, data collection and record linkage approaches. The public engagement was designed to enable individuals’ voices to be heard and acted upon in the design of the study, and to help ensure the study serves the needs of the people it represents.In addition, the project team has carried out extensive public engagement and consultation with policy and practitioner networks and with academic data users to determine evidence needs and scientific priorities for the feasibility study.Further information and reports can be found on our Public engagement page.Securing access to a high-quality sampling frame of babies born in all four UK countries is central to the feasibility study aims.We worked with agencies across the UK to develop applications to access centrally held records for this purpose, under appropriate governance mechanisms. Alongside this, we developed a programme of public engagement work to ensure public acceptability of our plans for sampling.Our preferred approach to use birth registrations, linked to NHS maternity records, has been successfully implemented in England, Wales and Scotland. In Northern Ireland, maternity records are used as the sampling frame.Birth registrations provide universal coverage of the population of babies, contain key characteristics of the baby, mother and father, including where they live, and may allow fathers resident at a different address to the baby to be recruited in their own right.NHS maternity records contain additional information which could be used for sampling, including the ethnic group of the baby, and facilitates timely access to updated addresses for any post-birth moves.Our approach was necessarily flexible and pragmatic in each UK nation, taking into account public views, as well as local processes and systems, logistics and governance around the implementation of an opt-out model of consent and timeliness.Different approval processes, data sources and sample provision in each UK nation has meant that the study started later in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales and Scotland.The study is designed for the public benefit, and our core values include a commitment to trustworthiness and transparency in the use of personal data, and enabling  individuals’ voices to be heard and acted upon.We have worked with families with children to co-design the study in way that allows participant voices from a diverse set of backgrounds to be heard.This included conducting qualitative research with parents who live apart from their children and parents from low-income families and minority ethnic families.The National Children’s Bureau and First 1001 Days Movement have supported a policy and practitioner consultation. We also consulted widely with data users from the academic, policy and third sectors.Find out more on the Public engagement page.An important aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of collecting biosamples and bio-measures.This includes saliva samples from both the infant and their parents for DNA extraction, in an experimental sub-group of the main survey.These measures will enable researchers to understand the interplay between biology and social environment on the developing child, including testing hypotheses relating to biological embedding of social adversity, mechanisms underlying resilience, and gene-environment interactions. The opportunity to fully genotype the cohort and natural parents before subsequent attrition takes place also brings strong methodological benefits.We randomised the DNA sample collection to a stratified sub-sample (about 600 issued sub-sample) to test whether this significantly impacts on successful recruitment into the study. Further, we tested levels and patterns of consent to provide DNA samples among those who did take part. The feasibility study also tested logistical factors in undertaking these collections at scale. We also tested sample storage and analysis options for the main study.We tested the feasibility of a number of novel approaches to data collection in the core domains of cognition, emotion, language, social development and the home and wider environment via small-scale field tests separate to the main survey.This included capture of neuro-cognitive function using direct assessment of neurocognitive development using habituation and looking-time-based methodologies. This was also supplemented with state of the art techniques such as eye-tracking and mobile EEG.We also explored the potential for using wearable and other devices to allow the passive collection of real-time behaviour through direct measurement. This included measuring the child’s linguistic environment (LENA system), activity level and physiology using wearable sensors.These small-scale field tests focused exclusively on the practical and training requirements for using these complex measurements in the context of a national cohort study. They also focused on the extent to which fieldworkers can be trained to successfully collect high-quality measurements in the home context.Administrative and geo-environmental linkages are embedded in the feasibility study from the outset.These will cover histories of the parents from before the pregnancy, plus pregnancy and birth records. Records will be linked from a constellation of agencies encountered by the baby and family, as the baby progresses through infancy and childhood.We asked permission to link administrative records for all participating parents and their child. We tested two models of consent and will initiate applications to link centrally held NHS health records. These would include:We also included consent for linkage to parental and child education records, and to social care records.

Life Cohort Feasibility Study\",\"description\":\"Between April 2021 and December 2024, the Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study tested the feasibility of sampling and recruitment for a new UK-wide birth cohort study. We will publish our findings here soon. In the meantime, we are delighted that the Economic and Social Research Council have agreed to fund a main study and have invited us to apply for the funding as a sole applicant. We look forward to submitting our proposal.The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study collected data on a new generation of UK-born babies in their first year of life. It captured information about their economic and social environments, and their health, wellbeing and development.The main aim of the project is to test the feasibility of sampling and recruitment for an innovative new UK-wide birth cohort study. However, the data from the feasibility study itself will also be made available to the research and policy community.The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study aims to paint a nationally representative picture of the circumstances and lives of a new cohort of babies born at a critical time in the UK’s history.With the economic and social repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impacts of Brexit on our economy and society still unknown, the need to understand the challenges facing this generation of babies, their development as children and their future prospects is pressing.The primary scientific aim of the study is to understand how inequalities in early child development are changing over time, and to learn whether the social and biological factors driving these trajectories are evolving.The key scientific themes include:The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study draws a nationally representative sample of babies born in a two-month period from all four UK nations. In England, Wales and Scotland the babies were born in November and December 2022, and in Northern Ireland the babies were born in June and July 2023. Interviews took place when the babies were around 9-12 months old.In England, Wales and Scotland, families were first contacted in July 2023 and fieldwork finished by the end of June 2024. In Northern Ireland, families were first contacted in February 2024 and fieldwork finished in September 2024.In total, 1,918 families took part:1,850 mums and 1,256 dads took part.The data will be available from the UK Data Service in 2025.Data collection involved interviews with mothers and fathers. Saliva samples from parents and infants for DNA extraction were collected from an experimental sub-group to test the impact on participation.The feasibility of innovative measures to capture babies’ development was also tested. These comprise neuro scientific measures (looking-time task, eye tracking, mobile EEG to measure brain activity, together with use of an actimetry device), and measurement of the early language environment (through placement in the home of a LENA recording device).We also tested additional infant biosamples (hair samples) and infant anthropometry (weight, length, head circumference and adiposity). The feasibility of collecting these specialist objective measurements using trained fieldwork agency staff was assessed via small scale field tests, separate to the main data collection.The study design will enable linkage to electronic and other administrative records of babies and parents as well as to geo-environmental data, which can provide information on environmental and other conditions in the places they spend time, including homes, childcare locations, and hospitals.Parents were asked about their baby’s health and growth, behaviour and development, sleep, diet and activities they do with their child. They were also asked about their home and family, including other children and their partner/other parent, their work situation and family finances, health and wellbeing, parenting approach and relationship with their baby, relationship support and services received, and childcare arrangements.Both mothers and fathers were invited to interview, including those who live apart from their child’s other parent. Each parent was interviewed separately.One parent was asked to complete a 60-minute interview in person with an interviewer. This longer interview was recommended for the parent who spends the most time with the baby. In most families, this was the child’s mother. There were options to complete the interview by telephone and by video call if an in-person interview was not possible.The other parent living with the baby, usually the child’s father, was asked to complete a 30-minute interview, either in-person with an interviewer or online. This interview was shorter because some questions only need to be asked once per baby or per household.Parents who lived apart from their baby, usually the fathers, were asked to complete a separate 40-minute interview. This interview could also be completed by telephone or by video call.Resident partners of parents, including those who live apart from the baby, were also invited to be interviewed.When no parents took part at an address, an invite was sent for one parent to take part in a 40-minute non-response web survey.Download the Early Life Cohort Study final questionnaire (February 2024, PDF)The study design focuses on maximising participation of traditionally ‘less often heard’ populations.In England, there were sample boosts for babies born into disadvantaged and ethnic minority families (Black Caribbean, Black African, Pakistani and Bangladeshi). There were further boosts of births in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We used experiments to test the effectiveness of different levels of incentives for taking part.We engaged fathers into the study, including those living in their own households.We have also worked with experts to understand how best to engage babies who are extremely vulnerable, including children born into care. Findings and recommendations from these expert discussions can be read in this Recommendations for next steps report (October 2024, PDF).The project team has undertaken careful public engagement with parents of children and young people to ensure acceptability of the proposed sampling, data collection and record linkage approaches. The public engagement was designed to enable individuals’ voices to be heard and acted upon in the design of the study, and to help ensure the study serves the needs of the people it represents.In addition, the project team has carried out extensive public engagement and consultation with policy and practitioner networks and with academic data users to determine evidence needs and scientific priorities for the feasibility study.Further information and reports can be found on our Public engagement page.Securing access to a high-quality sampling frame of babies born in all four UK countries is central to the feasibility study aims.We worked with agencies across the UK to develop applications to access centrally held records for this purpose, under appropriate governance mechanisms. Alongside this, we developed a programme of public engagement work to ensure public acceptability of our plans for sampling.Our preferred approach to use birth registrations, linked to NHS maternity records, has been successfully implemented in England, Wales and Scotland. In Northern Ireland, maternity records are used as the sampling frame.Birth registrations provide universal coverage of the population of babies, contain key characteristics of the baby, mother and father, including where they live, and may allow fathers resident at a different address to the baby to be recruited in their own right.NHS maternity records contain additional information which could be used for sampling, including the ethnic group of the baby, and facilitates timely access to updated addresses for any post-birth moves.Our approach was necessarily flexible and pragmatic in each UK nation, taking into account public views, as well as local processes and systems, logistics and governance around the implementation of an opt-out model of consent and timeliness.Different approval processes, data sources and sample provision in each UK nation has meant that the study started later in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales and Scotland.The study is designed for the public benefit, and our core values include a commitment to trustworthiness and transparency in the use of personal data, and enabling  individuals’ voices to be heard and acted upon.We have worked with families with children to co-design the study in way that allows participant voices from a diverse set of backgrounds to be heard.This included conducting qualitative research with parents who live apart from their children and parents from low-income families and minority ethnic families.The National Children’s Bureau and First 1001 Days Movement have supported a policy and practitioner consultation. We also consulted widely with data users from the academic, policy and third sectors.Find out more on the Public engagement page.An important aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of collecting biosamples and bio-measures.This includes saliva samples from both the infant and their parents for DNA extraction, in an experimental sub-group of the main survey.These measures will enable researchers to understand the interplay between biology and social environment on the developing child, including testing hypotheses relating to biological embedding of social adversity, mechanisms underlying resilience, and gene-environment interactions. The opportunity to fully genotype the cohort and natural parents before subsequent attrition takes place also brings strong methodological benefits.We randomised the DNA sample collection to a stratified sub-sample (about 600 issued sub-sample) to test whether this significantly impacts on successful recruitment into the study. Further, we tested levels and patterns of consent to provide DNA samples among those who did take part. The feasibility study also tested logistical factors in undertaking these collections at scale. We also tested sample storage and analysis options for the main study.We tested the feasibility of a number of novel approaches to data collection in the core domains of cognition, emotion, language, social development and the home and wider environment via small-scale field tests separate to the main survey.This included capture of neuro-cognitive function using direct assessment of neurocognitive development using habituation and looking-time-based methodologies. This was also supplemented with state of the art techniques such as eye-tracking and mobile EEG.We also explored the potential for using wearable and other devices to allow the passive collection of real-time behaviour through direct measurement. This included measuring the child’s linguistic environment (LENA system), activity level and physiology using wearable sensors.These small-scale field tests focused exclusively on the practical and training requirements for using these complex measurements in the context of a national cohort study. They also focused on the extent to which fieldworkers can be trained to successfully collect high-quality measurements in the home context.Administrative and geo-environmental linkages are embedded in the feasibility study from the outset.These will cover histories of the parents from before the pregnancy, plus pregnancy and birth records. Records will be linked from a constellation of agencies encountered by the baby and family, as the baby progresses through infancy and childhood.We asked permission to link administrative records for all participating parents and their child. We tested two models of consent and will initiate applications to link centrally held NHS health records. These would include:We also included consent for linkage to parental and child education records, and to social care records.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPhone: 020 7612 6231\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEmail: alissa.goodman@ucl.ac.uk\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlissa Goodman is Professor of Economics, Director of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies, and Co-Director of the Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study, a project funded by ESRC to test the feasibility of a new birth cohort for the UK.

The study focused on collecting data from a nationally representative sample of UK-born babies in their first year of life, capturing information about their economic and social environments, health, wellbeing, and development. The study was conducted in response to the economic and social changes brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit, with a focus on understanding how inequalities in early child development are evolving.\n\nThe study involved 1,918 families, with data collection through interviews with mothers and fathers, and included innovative measures such as neuro-scientific assessments and biosample collection. The study also tested the feasibility of linking data to electronic and administrative records. The project emphasized engaging traditionally underrepresented populations and included sample boosts for disadvantaged and ethnic minority families.\n\nThe findings from this feasibility study will inform the design of a main study, which has received funding from the Economic and Social Research Council.

We will publish our findings here soon. In the meantime, we are delighted that the Economic and Social Research Council have agreed to fund a main study and have invited us to apply for the funding as a sole applicant. We look forward to submitting our proposal.The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study collected data on a new generation of UK-born babies in their first year of life. It captured information about their economic and social environments, and their health, wellbeing and development.The main aim of the project is to test the feasibility of sampling and recruitment for an innovative new UK-wide birth cohort study. However, the data from the feasibility study itself will also be made available to the research and policy community.The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study aims to paint a nationally representative picture of the circumstances and lives of a new cohort of babies born at a critical time in the UK’s history.With the economic and social repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impacts of Brexit on our economy and society still unknown, the need to understand the challenges facing this generation of babies, their development as children and their future prospects is pressing.The primary scientific aim of the study is to understand how inequalities in early child development are changing over time, and to learn whether the social and biological factors driving these trajectories are evolving.The key scientific themes include:The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study draws a nationally representative sample of babies born in a two-month period from all four UK nations. In England, Wales and Scotland the babies were born in November and December 2022, and in Northern Ireland the babies were born in June and July 2023. Interviews took place when the babies were around 9-12 months old.In England, Wales and Scotland, families were first contacted in July 2023 and fieldwork finished by the end of June 2024. In Northern Ireland, families were first contacted in February 2024 and fieldwork finished in September 2024.In total, 1,918 families took part:1,850 mums and 1,256 dads took part.The data will be available from the UK Data Service in 2025.Data collection involved interviews with mothers and fathers. Saliva samples from parents and infants for DNA extraction were collected from an experimental sub-group to test the impact on participation.The feasibility of innovative measures to capture babies’ development was also tested. These comprise neuro scientific measures (looking-time task, eye tracking, mobile EEG to measure brain activity, together with use of an actimetry device), and measurement of the early language environment (through placement in the home of a LENA recording device).We also tested additional infant biosamples (hair samples) and infant anthropometry (weight, length, head circumference and adiposity). The feasibility of collecting these specialist objective measurements using trained fieldwork agency staff was assessed via small scale field tests, separate to the main data collection.The study design will enable linkage to electronic and other administrative records of babies and parents as well as to geo-environmental data, which can provide information on environmental and other conditions in the places they spend time, including homes, childcare locations, and hospitals.Parents were asked about their baby’s health and growth, behaviour and development, sleep, diet and activities they do with their child. They were also asked about their home and family, including other children and their partner/other parent, their work situation and family finances, health and wellbeing, parenting approach and relationship with their baby, relationship support and services received, and childcare arrangements.Both mothers and fathers were invited to interview, including those who live apart from their child’s other parent. Each parent was interviewed separately.One parent was asked to complete a 60-minute interview in person with an interviewer. This longer interview was recommended for the parent who spends the most time with the baby. In most families, this was the child’s mother. There were options to complete the interview by telephone and by video call if an in-person interview was not possible.The other parent living with the baby, usually the child’s father, was asked to complete a 30-minute interview, either in-person with an interviewer or online. This interview was shorter because some questions only need to be asked once per baby or per household.Parents who lived apart from their baby, usually the fathers, were asked to complete a separate 40-minute interview. This interview could also be completed by telephone or by video call.Resident partners of parents, including those who live apart from the baby, were also invited to be interviewed.When no parents took part at an address, an invite was sent for one parent to take part in a 40-minute non-response web survey.Download the Early Life Cohort Study final questionnaire (February 2024, PDF)The study design focuses on maximising participation of traditionally ‘less often heard’ populations.In England, there were sample boosts for babies born into disadvantaged and ethnic minority families (Black Caribbean, Black African, Pakistani and Bangladeshi). There were further boosts of births in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We used experiments to test the effectiveness of different levels of incentives for taking part.We engaged fathers into the study, including those living in their own households.We have also worked with experts to understand how best to engage babies who are extremely vulnerable, including children born into care. Findings and recommendations from these expert discussions can be read in this Recommendations for next steps report (October 2024, PDF).The project team has undertaken careful public engagement with parents of children and young people to ensure acceptability of the proposed sampling, data collection and record linkage approaches. The public engagement was designed to enable individuals’ voices to be heard and acted upon in the design of the study, and to help ensure the study serves the needs of the people it represents.In addition, the project team has carried out extensive public engagement and consultation with policy and practitioner networks and with academic data users to determine evidence needs and scientific priorities for the feasibility study.Further information and reports can be found on our Public engagement page.Securing access to a high-quality sampling frame of babies born in all four UK countries is central to the feasibility study aims.We worked with agencies across the UK to develop applications to access centrally held records for this purpose, under appropriate governance mechanisms. Alongside this, we developed a programme of public engagement work to ensure public acceptability of our plans for sampling.Our preferred approach to use birth registrations, linked to NHS maternity records, has been successfully implemented in England, Wales and Scotland. In Northern Ireland, maternity records are used as the sampling frame.Birth registrations provide universal coverage of the population of babies, contain key characteristics of the baby, mother and father, including where they live, and may allow fathers resident at a different address to the baby to be recruited in their own right.NHS maternity records contain additional information which could be used for sampling, including the ethnic group of the baby, and facilitates timely access to updated addresses for any post-birth moves.Our approach was necessarily flexible and pragmatic in each UK nation, taking into account public views, as well as local processes and systems, logistics and governance around the implementation of an opt-out model of consent and timeliness.Different approval processes, data sources and sample provision in each UK nation has meant that the study started later in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales and Scotland.The study is designed for the public benefit, and our core values include a commitment to trustworthiness and transparency in the use of personal data, and enabling  individuals’ voices to be heard and acted upon.We have worked with families with children to co-design the study in way that allows participant voices from a diverse set of backgrounds to be heard.This included conducting qualitative research with parents who live apart from their children and parents from low-income families and minority ethnic families.The National Children’s Bureau and First 1001 Days Movement have supported a policy and practitioner consultation. We also consulted widely with data users from the academic, policy and third sectors.Find out more on the Public engagement page.An important aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of collecting biosamples and bio-measures.This includes saliva samples from both the infant and their parents for DNA extraction, in an experimental sub-group of the main survey.These measures will enable researchers to understand the interplay between biology and social environment on the developing child, including testing hypotheses relating to biological embedding of social adversity, mechanisms underlying resilience, and gene-environment interactions. The opportunity to fully genotype the cohort and natural parents before subsequent attrition takes place also brings strong methodological benefits.We randomised the DNA sample collection to a stratified sub-sample (about 600 issued sub-sample) to test whether this significantly impacts on successful recruitment into the study. Further, we tested levels and patterns of consent to provide DNA samples among those who did take part. The feasibility study also tested logistical factors in undertaking these collections at scale. We also tested sample storage and analysis options for the main study.We tested the feasibility of a number of novel approaches to data collection in the core domains of cognition, emotion, language, social development and the home and wider environment via small-scale field tests separate to the main survey.This included capture of neuro-cognitive function using direct assessment of neurocognitive development using habituation and looking-time-based methodologies. This was also supplemented with state of the art techniques such as eye-tracking and mobile EEG.We also explored the potential for using wearable and other devices to allow the passive collection of real-time behaviour through direct measurement. This included measuring the child’s linguistic environment (LENA system), activity level and physiology using wearable sensors.These small-scale field tests focused exclusively on the practical and training requirements for using these complex measurements in the context of a national cohort study. They also focused on the extent to which fieldworkers can be trained to successfully collect high-quality measurements in the home context.Administrative and geo-environmental linkages are embedded in the feasibility study from the outset.These will cover histories of the parents from before the pregnancy, plus pregnancy and birth records. Records will be linked from a constellation of agencies encountered by the baby and family, as the baby progresses through infancy and childhood.We asked permission to link administrative records for all participating parents and their child. We tested two models of consent and will initiate applications to link centrally held NHS health records. These would include:We also included consent for linkage to parental and child education records, and to social care records.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhone: 020 7612 6231\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail: alissa.goodman@ucl.ac.uk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlissa Goodman is Professor of Economics, Director of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies, and Co-Director of the Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study, a project funded by ESRC to test the feasibility of a new birth cohort for the UK.

We will publish our findings here soon. In the meantime, we are delighted that the Economic and Social Research Council have agreed to fund a main study and have invited us to apply for the funding as a sole applicant. We look forward to submitting our proposal.The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study collected data on a new generation of UK-born babies in their first year of life. It captured information about their economic and social environments, and their health, wellbeing and development.The main aim of the project is to test the feasibility of sampling and recruitment for an innovative new UK-wide birth cohort study. However, the data from the feasibility study itself will also be made available to the research and policy community.The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study aims to paint a nationally representative picture of the circumstances and lives of a new cohort of babies born at a critical time in the UK’s history.With the economic and social repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impacts of Brexit on our economy and society still unknown, the need to understand the challenges facing this generation of babies, their development as children and their future prospects is pressing.The primary scientific aim of the study is to understand how inequalities in early child development are changing over time, and to learn whether the social and biological factors driving these trajectories are evolving.The key scientific themes include:The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study draws a nationally representative sample of babies born in a two-month period from all four UK nations. In England, Wales and Scotland the babies were born in November and December 2022, and in Northern Ireland the babies were born in June and July 2023. Interviews took place when the babies were around 9-12 months old.In England, Wales and Scotland, families were first contacted in July 2023 and fieldwork finished by the end of June 2024. In Northern Ireland, families were first contacted in February 2024 and fieldwork finished in September 2024.In total, 1,918 families took part:1,850 mums and 1,256 dads took part.The data will be available from the UK Data Service in 2025.Data collection involved interviews with mothers and fathers. Saliva samples from parents and infants for DNA extraction were collected from an experimental sub-group to test the impact on participation.The feasibility of innovative measures to capture babies’ development was also tested. These comprise neuro scientific measures (looking-time task, eye tracking, mobile EEG to measure brain activity, together with use of an actimetry device), and measurement of the early language environment (through placement in the home of a LENA recording device).We also tested additional infant biosamples (hair samples) and infant anthropometry (weight, length, head circumference and adiposity). The feasibility of collecting these specialist objective measurements using trained fieldwork agency staff was assessed via small scale field tests, separate to the main data collection.The study design will enable linkage to electronic and other administrative records of babies and parents as well as to geo-environmental data, which can provide information on environmental and other conditions in the places they spend time, including homes, childcare locations, and hospitals.Parents were asked about their baby’s health and growth, behaviour and development, sleep, diet and activities they do with their child. They were also asked about their home and family, including other children and their partner/other parent, their work situation and family finances, health and wellbeing, parenting approach and relationship with their baby, relationship support and services received, and childcare arrangements.Both mothers and fathers were invited to interview, including those who live apart from their child’s other parent. Each parent was interviewed separately.One parent was asked to complete a 60-minute interview in person with an interviewer. This longer interview was recommended for the parent who spends the most time with the baby. In most families, this was the child’s mother. There were options to complete the interview by telephone and by video call if an in-person interview was not possible.The other parent living with the baby, usually the child’s father, was asked to complete a 30-minute interview, either in-person with an interviewer or online. This interview was shorter because some questions only need to be asked once per baby or per household.Parents who lived apart from their baby, usually the fathers, were asked to complete a separate 40-minute interview. This interview could also be completed by telephone or by video call.Resident partners of parents, including those who live apart from the baby, were also invited to be interviewed.When no parents took part at an address, an invite was sent for one parent to take part in a 40-minute non-response web survey.Download the Early Life Cohort Study final questionnaire (February 2024, PDF)The study design focuses on maximising participation of traditionally ‘less often heard’ populations.In England, there were sample boosts for babies born into disadvantaged and ethnic minority families (Black Caribbean, Black African, Pakistani and Bangladeshi). There were further boosts of births in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We used experiments to test the effectiveness of different levels of incentives for taking part.We engaged fathers into the study, including those living in their own households.We have also worked with experts to understand how best to engage babies who are extremely vulnerable, including children born into care. Findings and recommendations from these expert discussions can be read in this Recommendations for next steps report (October 2024, PDF).The project team has undertaken careful public engagement with parents of children and young people to ensure acceptability of the proposed sampling, data collection and record linkage approaches. The public engagement was designed to enable individuals’ voices to be heard and acted upon in the design of the study, and to help ensure the study serves the needs of the people it represents.In addition, the project team has carried out extensive public engagement and consultation with policy and practitioner networks and with academic data users to determine evidence needs and scientific priorities for the feasibility study.Further information and reports can be found on our Public engagement page.Securing access to a high-quality sampling frame of babies born in all four UK countries is central to the feasibility study aims.We worked with agencies across the UK to develop applications to access centrally held records for this purpose, under appropriate governance mechanisms. Alongside this, we developed a programme of public engagement work to ensure public acceptability of our plans for sampling.Our preferred approach to use birth registrations, linked to NHS maternity records, has been successfully implemented in England, Wales and Scotland. In Northern Ireland, maternity records are used as the sampling frame.Birth registrations provide universal coverage of the population of babies, contain key characteristics of the baby, mother and father, including where they live, and may allow fathers resident at a different address to the baby to be recruited in their own right.NHS maternity records contain additional information which could be used for sampling, including the ethnic group of the baby, and facilitates timely access to updated addresses for any post-birth moves.Our approach was necessarily flexible and pragmatic in each UK nation, taking into account public views, as well as local processes and systems, logistics and governance around the implementation of an opt-out model of consent and timeliness.Different approval processes, data sources and sample provision in each UK nation has meant that the study started later in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales and Scotland.The study is designed for the public benefit, and our core values include a commitment to trustworthiness and transparency in the use of personal data, and enabling  individuals’ voices to be heard and acted upon.We have worked with families with children to co-design the study in way that allows participant voices from a diverse set of backgrounds to be heard.This included conducting qualitative research with parents who live apart from their children and parents from low-income families and minority ethnic families.The National Children’s Bureau and First 1001 Days Movement have supported a policy and practitioner consultation. We also consulted widely with data users from the academic, policy and third sectors.Find out more on the Public engagement page.An important aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of collecting biosamples and bio-measures.This includes saliva samples from both the infant and their parents for DNA extraction, in an experimental sub-group of the main survey.These measures will enable researchers to understand the interplay between biology and social environment on the developing child, including testing hypotheses relating to biological embedding of social adversity, mechanisms underlying resilience, and gene-environment interactions. The opportunity to fully genotype the cohort and natural parents before subsequent attrition takes place also brings strong methodological benefits.We randomised the DNA sample collection to a stratified sub-sample (about 600 issued sub-sample) to test whether this significantly impacts on successful recruitment into the study. Further, we tested levels and patterns of consent to provide DNA samples among those who did take part. The feasibility study also tested logistical factors in undertaking these collections at scale. We also tested sample storage and analysis options for the main study.We tested the feasibility of a number of novel approaches to data collection in the core domains of cognition, emotion, language, social development and the home and wider environment via small-scale field tests separate to the main survey.This included capture of neuro-cognitive function using direct assessment of neurocognitive development using habituation and looking-time-based methodologies. This was also supplemented with state of the art techniques such as eye-tracking and mobile EEG.We also explored the potential for using wearable and other devices to allow the passive collection of real-time behaviour through direct measurement. This included measuring the child’s linguistic environment (LENA system), activity level and physiology using wearable sensors.These small-scale field tests focused exclusively on the practical and training requirements for using these complex measurements in the context of a national cohort study. They also focused on the extent to which fieldworkers can be trained to successfully collect high-quality measurements in the home context.Administrative and geo-environmental linkages are embedded in the feasibility study from the outset.These will cover histories of the parents from before the pregnancy, plus pregnancy and birth records. Records will be linked from a constellation of agencies encountered by the baby and family, as the baby progresses through infancy and childhood.We asked permission to link administrative records for all participating parents and their child. We tested two models of consent and will initiate applications to link centrally held NHS health records. These would include:We also included consent for linkage to parental and child education records, and to social care records.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhone: 020 7612 6231\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail: alissa.goodman@ucl.ac.uk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlissa Goodman is Professor of Economics, Director of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies, and Co-Director of the Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study, a project funded by ESRC to test the feasibility of a new birth cohort for the UK.
