Here you can read about the feasibility study.We are delighted that the Economic and Social Research Council have decided to fund a main study, Generation New Era.The Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) is to launch a new UK-wide study that will test approaches to setting up a full large-scale national birth cohort study in the future.The Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) is to launch a new UK-wide study that will test approaches to setting up a full large-scale national birth cohort study in the future.The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study collected data on a new generation of UK-born babies in their first year of life. It captured information about their economic and social environments, and their health, wellbeing and development.The main aim of the project was to test the feasibility of sampling and recruitment for an innovative new UK-wide birth cohort study. However, the data from the feasibility study itself will also be made available to the research and policy community.Most of the Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study Age 9-10 Months Sweep data are available for free from the UK Data Service under an end user licence agreement, with selected sensitive data available under secure access arrangements:Data available under end user licence.Data available under secure access.The questionnaire and user guide for the sweep are available to download.Download the questionnaire.Download the user guide.The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study aims to paint a nationally representative picture of the circumstances and lives of a new cohort of babies born at a critical time in the UK’s history.With the economic and social repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impacts of Brexit on our economy and society still unknown, the need to understand the challenges facing this generation of babies, their development as children and their future prospects is pressing.The primary scientific aim of the study is to understand how inequalities in early child development are changing over time, and to learn whether the social and biological factors driving these trajectories are evolving.The key scientific themes include:The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study draws a nationally representative sample of babies born in a two-month period from all four UK nations. In England, Wales and Scotland the babies were born in November and December 2022, and in Northern Ireland the babies were born in June and July 2023. Interviews took place when the babies were around 9-12 months old.In England, Wales and Scotland, families were first contacted in July 2023 and fieldwork finished by the end of June 2024. In Northern Ireland, families were first contacted in February 2024 and fieldwork finished in September 2024.In total, 1,918 families took part:1,850 mums and 1,256 dads took part.The data will be available from the UK Data Service in 2025.Read the briefing paper to learn more about the findings from the survey component (April 2025, PDF).The small-scale field tests, also referred to as ELC+, assessed the feasibility of collecting novel child development, home environment and stress markers in the home by agency fieldworkers.The measures tested included neuroscience-informed and anthropometric measures (EEG, eye tracking, adiposity), hair samples, and audio-recording of the home language environment.Eight agency interviewers were trained and conducted these assessments with 93 children aged 6-12 months from London and Cambridge in a 100-minute home visit. ELC+ concluded that a battery of this kind would be feasible and would produce high-quality novel data. Feedback from parents was also consistently very positive.Read the briefing paper to learn more about the findings from the small-scale field tests (April 2025, PDF).Data collection involved interviews with mothers and fathers. Saliva samples from parents and infants for DNA extraction were collected from an experimental sub-group to test the impact on participation.The feasibility of innovative measures to capture babies’ development was also tested. These comprised neuro scientific measures (looking-time task, eye tracking, mobile EEG to measure brain activity, together with use of an actimetry device), and measurement of the early language environment (through placement in the home of a LENA recording device).We also tested additional infant biosamples (hair samples) and infant anthropometry (weight, length, head circumference and adiposity)."/><meta property="og:title" content="Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study"/><meta property="og:description" content="Between April 2021 and December 2024, the Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study tested the feasibility of sampling and recruitment for a new UK-wide birth cohort study.

The study was designed to understand how inequalities in early child development are changing over time and to explore the social and biological factors influencing these trajectories.\n\nThe study involved a nationally representative sample of babies born in a two-month period from all four UK nations, with interviews conducted when the babies were around 9-12 months old. A total of 1,918 families participated, with data collection involving interviews with both mothers and fathers. The study also tested the feasibility of collecting novel child development measures, including neuroscience-informed and anthropometric measures, and biosamples such as saliva for DNA extraction.\n\nThe study design included efforts to engage traditionally underrepresented populations and involved public engagement to ensure the study's acceptability and relevance. The feasibility study's findings will inform the design of a full-scale national birth cohort study, Generation New Era, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.
