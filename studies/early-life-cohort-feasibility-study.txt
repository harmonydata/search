In England, Wales and Scotland the babies were born in November and December 2022, and in Northern Ireland the babies were born in June and July 2023. Interviews took place when the babies were around 9-12 months old.In England, Wales and Scotland, families were first contacted in July 2023 and fieldwork finished by the end of June 2024.

They were also asked about their home and family, including other children and their partner/other parent, their work situation and family finances, health and wellbeing, parenting approach and relationship with their baby, relationship support and services received, and childcare arrangements.Both mothers and fathers were invited to interview, including those who live apart from their child’s other parent.

The study focused on collecting data from a nationally representative sample of UK-born babies in their first year of life, capturing information about their economic and social environments, health, wellbeing, and development. The study was conducted in response to the economic and social changes brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit, with a focus on understanding how inequalities in early child development are evolving.

The study involved 1,918 families, with data collection through interviews with mothers and fathers, and included innovative measures such as neuro-scientific assessments and biosample collection. The study also tested the feasibility of linking data to electronic and administrative records. The project emphasized engaging traditionally underrepresented populations and included sample boosts for disadvantaged and ethnic minority families.

The findings from this feasibility study will inform the design of a main study, which has received funding from the Economic and Social Research Council. The data collected will be made available to the research and policy community, contributing to a better understanding of the challenges facing the new generation of UK-born babies.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study","description":"$15","url":["https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/early-life-cohort-feasibility-study/"],"keywords":[],"identifier":[],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies","url":"https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/"}],"keywords_automatically_imputed":["Cognitive measures","Victimisation and life events","Social care - need"]},"extra_data":{"study_design":["experimental","administrative","linked","survey","qualitative","household","cohort","birth","pregnancy","geo","longitudinal"],"urls":["https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/early-life-cohort-feasibility-study/"],"sex":"all","language_codes":["en"],"ai_summary":"$16","duration_years":null,"name":"Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study","num_variables":null,"country_codes":["UK"],"dois":[],"genetic_data_collected":false,"geographic_coverage":"","resource_type":"study","source":["cls"],"start_year":null,"instruments":[],"slug":"early-life-cohort-feasibility-study","data_access":null,"end_year":null,"harmony_id":"cls/early-life-cohort-feasibility-study","uuid":"16cebf63e2539c77d31e922969009a25"},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":true}]]

These comprise neuro scientific measures (looking-time task, eye tracking, mobile EEG to measure brain activity, together with use of an actimetry device), and measurement of the early language environment (through placement in the home of a LENA recording device).We also tested additional infant biosamples (hair samples) and infant anthropometry (weight, length, head circumference and adiposity). The feasibility of collecting these specialist objective measurements using trained fieldwork agency staff was assessed via small scale field tests, separate to the main data collection.The study design will enable linkage to electronic and other administrative records of babies and parents as well as to geo-environmental data, which can provide information on environmental and other conditions in the places they spend time, including homes, childcare locations, and hospitals.Parents were asked about their baby’s health and growth, behaviour and development, sleep, diet and activities they do with their child. They were also asked about their home and family, including other children and their partner/other parent, their work situation and family finances, health and wellbeing, parenting approach and relationship with their baby, relationship support and services received, and childcare arrangements.Both mothers and fathers were invited to interview, including those who live apart from their child’s other parent. Each parent was interviewed separately.One parent was asked to complete a 60-minute interview in person with an interviewer. This longer interview was recommended for the parent who spends the most time with the baby. In most families, this was the child’s mother. There were options to complete the interview by telephone and by video call if an in-person interview was not possible.The other parent living with the baby, usually the child’s father, was asked to complete a 30-minute interview, either in-person with an interviewer or online. This interview was shorter because some questions only need to be asked once per baby or per household.19:T1285,Between April 2021 and December 2024, the Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study tested the feasibility of sampling and recruitment for a new UK-wide birth cohort study. We will publish our findings here soon. In the meantime, we are delighted that the Economic and Social Research Council have agreed to fund a main study and have invited us to apply for the funding as a sole applicant. We look forward to submitting our proposal.The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study collected data on a new generation of UK-born babies in their first year of life. It captured information about their economic and social environments, and their health, wellbeing and development.The main aim of the project is to test the feasibility of sampling and recruitment for an innovative new UK-wide birth cohort study. However, the data from the feasibility study itself will also be made available to the research and policy community.The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study aims to paint a nationally representative picture of the circumstances and lives of a new cohort of babies born at a critical time in the UK’s history.With the economic and social repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impacts of Brexit on our economy and society still unknown, the need to understand the challenges facing this generation of babies, their development as children and their future prospects is pressing.The primary scientific aim of the study is to understand how inequalities in early child development are changing over time, and to learn whether the social and biological factors driving these trajectories are evolving.The key scientific themes include:The Early Life Cohort Feasibility Study draws a nationally representative sample of babies born in a two-month period from all four UK nations. In England, Wales and Scotland the babies were born in November and December 2022, and in Northern Ireland the babies were born in June and July 2023. Interviews took place when the babies were around 9-12 months old.In England, Wales and Scotland, families were first contacted in July 2023 and fieldwork finished by the end of June 2024. In Northern Ireland, families were first contacted in February 2024 and fieldwork finished in September 2024.In total, 1,918 families took part:1,850 mums and 1,256 dads took part.The data will be available from the UK Data Service in 2025.Data collection involved interviews with mothers and fathers.
