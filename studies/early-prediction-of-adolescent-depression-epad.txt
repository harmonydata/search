The methodology involves tracking the mental health and wellbeing of both parents and their offspring, collecting data on various psychological, social, and biological factors. Key findings from the EPAD study have contributed to the development of predictive tools and early intervention strategies, which are crucial for providing targeted support to at-risk individuals. The study's outcomes are intended to enhance both national and international approaches to mental health, offering valuable insights for affected individuals and their families.","urls":["https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=EPAD",""],"resource_type":"study","harmony_id":"mhc/epad","end_year":null,"genetic_data_collected":false,"dois":["https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(15)00358-2"],"data_access":"Contact study team to express an interest in accessing the data <br>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/research/explore/find-a-project/view/the-cardiff-university-mood-and-wellbeing-study\">www.cardiff.ac.uk/research/explore/find-a-project/view/the-cardiff-university-mood-and-wellbeing-study</a>  ","start_year":2007,"country_codes":["GB"],"uuid":"7da764b984fb08f36198aa9a9240c8b2","number_of_variables":469},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"variables_which_matched":"$undefined"},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":false}]]
