Participants in the study contribute by providing genetic samples and detailed information about their experiences, which are then analyzed to identify potential genetic markers and environmental influences associated with these conditions. The study is conducted in collaboration with the NIHR BioResource Centre Maudsley, which facilitates the collection and analysis of data. The ultimate goal of EDGI is to improve understanding of the biological and environmental underpinnings of eating disorders, which could lead to better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies.","name":"Eating Disorders Genetics Initiative","geographic_coverage":"England","sex":"all","age_lower":16,"resource_type":"study","sample_size":21322,"end_year":null,"uuid":"a1c964cfed1e3f54ccc20eea1fa6deff","number_of_variables":1086},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"variables_which_matched":"$undefined"},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":false}]}]]
