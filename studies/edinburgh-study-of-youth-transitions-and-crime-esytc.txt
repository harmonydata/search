Initiated in 1998, the study tracks a cohort of approximately 4,300 individuals who began secondary school in Edinburgh, Scotland. The research aims to understand the factors influencing youth involvement in crime and the long-term consequences of such behavior.

The study employs a mixed-methods approach, collecting data through self-report questionnaires administered at various stages of the participants' lives, from age 12 to 33. Additionally, in-depth interviews are conducted with selected sub-samples of the cohort at ages 24 and 35 to gain deeper insights into their life experiences and perspectives. The study is enriched by linking participants' data with administrative records, including educational achievements, social work interactions, and criminal convictions.

Key findings from the ESYTC highlight the complex interplay of individual, familial, and social factors in the development of criminal behavior. The research underscores the importance of early intervention and the role of social support systems in mitigating the risk of persistent offending. The study's longitudinal nature allows for a nuanced understanding of how early life experiences and transitions impact later life outcomes, making it a significant contribution to criminology and social policy.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"The Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime (ESYTC)","description":"The Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime is a prospective longitudinal cohort study aimed to examine criminal offending in young people by investigating the causes and consequences of young people’s involvement in crime and anti-social behaviour.\n\nThe study follows a cohort of around 4,300 young people who started secondary school in the City of Edinburgh in the autumn of 1998.
