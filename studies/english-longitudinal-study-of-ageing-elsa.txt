It aims to explore the dynamics of aging by collecting data across various domains such as economic circumstances, health (both physical and mental), employment, retirement, and social relationships. ELSA employs a multidisciplinary approach, integrating data from interviews, self-completion questionnaires, and health assessments. The study is designed to inform policy and improve understanding of how aging affects individuals and society. Key findings from ELSA have highlighted the impact of socioeconomic status on health outcomes, the importance of social networks in aging, and the diverse experiences of retirement. The study's longitudinal nature allows for the examination of changes over time, providing valuable insights into the aging process and its implications for public health and social policy.","sex":"all","resource_type":"study","harmony_id":"ukllc/elsa","end_year":null,"genetic_data_collected":false,"dois":["https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1219686110","https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dys168","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.l6377"],"data_access":null,"start_year":2002,"country_codes":["GB"],"uuid":"713471e8ac1096e872dd3ea0ea7caa07","number_of_variables":2378},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"child_datasets":[{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Non-financial Derived Variables Wave 9","description":"Takes some of the complex information relating to demographics, health and other circumstances  contained across all the whole ELSA interview creates useful variables for analysis.
