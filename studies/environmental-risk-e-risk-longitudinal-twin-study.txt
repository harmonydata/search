This study involves a nationally representative cohort of twins, allowing researchers to disentangle the effects of shared genetics and environmental influences.

The E-Risk study collects extensive data on a wide range of topics, including mental health issues, obesity, asthma, academic performance, criminal behavior, experiences of violence, and neighborhood and family environments. Additionally, the study incorporates biological measures such as inflammation markers, gene expression, epigenetic DNA methylation, telomere length, and neuropsychological assessments.

Key findings from the E-Risk study have contributed significantly to understanding how early-life environments and genetic predispositions interact to influence developmental trajectories and health outcomes. The study's longitudinal design enables the examination of changes over time, providing insights into the persistence and evolution of various behaviors and conditions.

The significance of the E-Risk study lies in its ability to inform interventions and policies aimed at improving mental health and well-being by identifying modifiable environmental factors and understanding their interaction with genetic vulnerabilities.c:[["$","$L14",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$15"}}],["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":["$","$L16",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study","description":"Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study is a nationally representative twin cohort study that aims to build a knowledge about how environmental and genetic factors contribute to behaviours and the development of mental health problems from childhood through to young adulthood.
