EPIC-Norfolk specifically focuses on a population in Norfolk, UK, and involves around 25,000 participants who were recruited between 1993 and 1997. The study collects detailed dietary, lifestyle, and health data through questionnaires, physical examinations, and biological samples.

The primary objective of EPIC-Norfolk is to understand how various factors such as diet, physical activity, and other lifestyle choices influence the development of cancer and other diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The study employs a prospective cohort design, meaning it follows participants over time to observe how their exposures affect their health outcomes.

Key findings from EPIC-Norfolk have contributed significantly to the understanding of the role of diet and lifestyle in disease prevention. For example, the study has provided insights into the benefits of a high-fiber diet, the impact of physical activity on health, and the risks associated with obesity and smoking.

The significance of EPIC-Norfolk lies in its comprehensive approach to data collection and its contribution to public health guidelines and policies aimed at reducing the burden of chronic diseases through lifestyle modifications.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition - Norfolk (EPIC-N)","description":"EPIC-Norfolk is part of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC), a large-scale project that studies populations across Europe to investigate the relationships between diet, nutrition, lifestyle and environmental factors, and the incidence of cancer and other chronic diseases.
