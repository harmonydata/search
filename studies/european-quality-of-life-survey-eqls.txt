Additionally, it explores subjective dimensions such as happiness, life satisfaction, and perceptions of societal quality.\n\nThe EQLS provides valuable insights into how Europeans perceive their living conditions and societal changes. By conducting the survey at regular intervals, it allows for the tracking of trends and shifts in quality of life across different European countries over time.
