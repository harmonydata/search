It also looks at subjective topics, such as people's levels of happiness, how satisfied they are with their lives, and how they perceive the quality of their societies. By running the survey regularly, it has become possible to track key trends in the quality of people's lives over time using the EQLS.","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/EQLS.png","publisher":{"name":"European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound)","url":"$undefined","logo":"$undefined"},"funders":[{"name":"EU_flag \nEurofound is an agency of the European Union","url":"$undefined","logo":"$undefined"}],"geographicCoverage":"AL, GB, IE, ME, RS, TR","temporalCoverage":"2003/2016","ageCoverage":"18+ years","studyDesign":["cross sectional"],"resourceType":"study","topics":["Housing","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Loneliness and social isolation","Neighbourhood","Political and social attitudes","Digital technology and social media","Work and employment","Social care - receipt","Social care - provision","Social care - need"],"instruments":["WHO-5 Wellbeing Index"],"dataCatalogs":[{"name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/","logo":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"}],"matchedVariables":[{"name":"My daily life has been filled with things that interest me","source":["mhc"],"keywords":["Psychological wellbeing"],"response_options":["All of the time","Most of the time","More than half of the time","Less than half of the time","Some of the time","At no time"]},{"name":"My daily life has been filled with things that interest me","source":["mhc"],"keywords":["Psychological wellbeing"],"response_options":["All of the time","Most of the time","More than half of the time","Less than half of the time","Some of the time","At no time"]},{"name":"I woke up feeling fresh and rested","source":["mhc"],"keywords":["Psychological wellbeing"],"response_options":["All of the time","Most of the time","More than half of the time","Less than half of the time","Some of the time","At no time"]},{"name":"I woke up feeling fresh and rested","source":["mhc"],"keywords":["Psychological wellbeing"],"response_options":["All of the time","Most of the time","More than half of the time","Less than half of the time","Some of the time","At no time"]},{"name":"I have felt active and vigorous","source":["mhc"],"keywords":["Psychological wellbeing"],"response_options":["All of the time","Most of the time","More than half of the time","Less than half of the time","Some of the time","At no time"]},{"name":"I have felt active and vigorous","source":["mhc"],"keywords":["Psychological wellbeing"],"response_options":["All of the time","Most of the time","More than half of the time","Less than half of the time","Some of the time","At no time"]},{"name":"I have felt calm and relaxed","source":["mhc"],"keywords":["Psychological wellbeing"],"response_options":["All of the time","Most of the time","More than half of the time","Less than half of the time","Some of the time","At no time"]},{"name":"I have felt calm and relaxed","source":["mhc"],"keywords":["Psychological wellbeing"],"response_options":["All of the time","Most of the time","More than half of the time","Less than half of the time","Some of the time","At no time"]},{"name":"I have felt cheerful and in good spirits","source":["mhc"],"keywords":["Psychological wellbeing"],"response_options":["All of the time","Most of the time","More than half of the time","Less than half of the time","Some of the time","At no time"]},{"name":"I have felt cheerful and in good spirits","source":["mhc"],"keywords":["Psychological wellbeing"],"response_options":["All of the time","Most of the time","More than half of the time","Less than half of the time","Some of the time","At no time"]}],"allVariables":[{"name":"I have felt cheerful and in good spirits","options":["All of the time","Most of the time","More than half of the time","Less than half of the time","Some of the time","At no time"]},{"name":"I have felt calm and relaxed","options":["All of the time","Most of the time","More than half of the time","Less than half of the time","Some of the time","At no time"]},{"name":"I have felt active and vigorous","options":["All of the time","Most of the time","More than half of the time","Less than half of the time","Some of the time","At no time"]},{"name":"I woke up feeling fresh and rested","options":["All of the time","Most of the time","More than half of the time","Less than half of the time","Some of the time","At no time"]},{"name":"My daily life has been filled with things that interest me","options":["All of the time","Most of the time","More than half of the time","Less than half of the time","Some of the time","At no time"]}],"additionalLinks":["https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=EQLS","https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/european-quality-of-life-surveys"],"child_datasets":[]}}]
