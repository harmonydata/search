It provides a comprehensive overview of the social, political, and moral landscape of Europe, allowing researchers to track changes and stability over time. Each wave of the survey uses new cross-sectional, representative samples to ensure the data's relevance and accuracy.

The ESS covers a wide range of topics, including media use, social trust, political engagement, subjective well-being, and human values, among others. The survey's methodology is rigorous, employing face-to-face interviews and standardized questionnaires to ensure comparability across countries and over time.

Key findings from the ESS have highlighted significant trends and differences in areas such as trust in institutions, political participation, and social cohesion. The data has been instrumental in informing policy decisions, academic research, and public debate on social issues in Europe.

The significance of the ESS lies in its ability to provide high-quality, reliable data that reflects the changing dynamics of European societies. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the complex interplay of social, economic, and political factors shaping the continent.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"European Social Survey (ESS)","description":"The European Social Survey is a biennial cross-national survey using new cross-sectional, representative samples at each wave.
