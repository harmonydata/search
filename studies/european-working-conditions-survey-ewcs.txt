It aims to provide a comprehensive picture of the everyday reality of men and women at work, and to do so covers a wide range of themes such as employment status, working time duration, learning and training, physical and psychosocial risk factors, health and safety, work-life balance, financial security and worker participation. The survey has also allowed researchers to analyse relationships between different aspects of working conditions, identify risk groups and issues of concern as well as progress, and monitor the trends of these issues.","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/EWCS.png","publisher":{"name":"European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions
