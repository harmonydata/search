16:T5a5,The Fenland Study is a population-based cohort study conducted in the UK, focusing on the interaction between genetic and environmental factors in the development of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and related metabolic disorders. The study involves participants from the Cambridgeshire region, specifically targeting individuals aged 30-55 years at recruitment. The methodology includes detailed phenotyping, which encompasses measurements of body composition, physical activity, diet, and metabolic health markers. Genetic data is also collected to explore gene-environment interactions.

Key findings from the Fenland Study have contributed to understanding how lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity interact with genetic predispositions to influence the risk of developing metabolic diseases. The study's comprehensive approach allows for the examination of how specific genetic variants may modify the effects of environmental exposures on metabolic health outcomes.

The significance of the Fenland Study lies in its potential to inform public health strategies aimed at preventing obesity and type 2 diabetes by identifying modifiable risk factors and understanding the underlying mechanisms of these complex diseases. The study's findings can help tailor interventions to individuals based on their genetic and environmental profiles, ultimately contributing to more personalized approaches in disease prevention and management.c:[["$","$L14",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Dataset\",\"name\":\"Fenland Study\",\"description\":\"The Fenland Study investigates the interaction between environmental and genetic factors in determining obesity, type 2 diabetes and related metabolic disorders. \",\"url\":\"https://harmonydata.ac.uk/search/studies/fenland-study\",\"identifier\":[],\"keywords\":[\"Covid-19 data collection\",\"Biomarkers\",\"Diet and nutrition\",\"Education\",\"Ethnicity and race\",\"Housing\",\"Socioeconomic status and deprivation\",\"Loneliness and social isolation\",\"Physical health assessment\",\"Work and employment\",\"Sleep problems\"],\"temporalCoverage\":\"2005/..\",\"creator\":[{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"University of Cambridge\"}]}"}}],["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":["$","$L15",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Fenland Study","description":"The Fenland Study investigates the interaction between environmental and genetic factors in determining obesity, type 2 diabetes and related metabolic disorders.
