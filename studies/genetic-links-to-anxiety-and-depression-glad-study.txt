By recruiting a large cohort of participants who have experienced anxiety and/or depression, the study collects genetic, environmental, and clinical data to analyze the complex interactions that contribute to these conditions. The ultimate goal is to enhance the development of more effective treatments and interventions, thereby improving the quality of life for individuals affected by anxiety and depression.
