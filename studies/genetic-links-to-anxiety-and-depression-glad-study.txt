Conducted under the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Mental Health BioResource, the study seeks to identify genetic risk factors associated with these common mental health disorders. By recruiting a large cohort of participants who have experienced anxiety and/or depression, the study collects genetic, environmental, and clinical data to analyze the complex interactions that contribute to these conditions. The ultimate goal is to enhance the development of more effective treatments and interventions, thereby improving the quality of life for individuals affected by anxiety and depression. The study's findings are expected to contribute significantly to the field of psychiatric genetics and personalized medicine.","sample_size":41043,"name":"Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study","num_variables":null,"country_codes":["GB","IE"],"duration_years":null,"language_codes":["en"],"genetic_data_collected":false,"geographic_coverage":"England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland / Nationwide","resource_type":"study","source":["ukllc"],"start_year":2018,"sex":"all","instruments":[],"slug":"genetic-links-to-anxiety-and-depression-glad-study","harmony_id":"ukllc/glad","data_access":null,"age_lower":16,"end_year":null,"uuid":"958072aa331072080a17d7d22acd290e"},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":true}]]
