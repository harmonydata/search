Launched in 2005, GUS has collected information on three nationally representative cohorts of children born in 2004-05 (Birth Cohort 1), 2002-03 (Child Cohort) and 2010-11 (Birth Cohort 2). This page provides information about Birth Cohort 1 (BC1). The main aim of the study is to provide new information to support policymaking in Scotland, but it is also intended to provide a resource for practitioners, academics, the voluntary sector and parents.</p><div class="MuiBox-root mui-10c8zph"><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 mui-k2l056">Show More</p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0

The project employed an observational, cross-sectional design that sub-sampled from Birth Cohort 1 (BC1) of the GUS during the GUS Sweep 8 fieldwork. Children sub-sampled from GUS were invited to provide objectively measured physical activity data by wearing an accelerometer for eight days.This dataset provides a range of summary physical activity variables from this project. A total of 775 children provided valid data. As a sub sample of GUS BC1, the summary level physical activity data can be linked, where appropriate, to other GUS BC1 datasets held on UKDS at the individual level. The physical activity data were collected between May 2015 and May 2016 by the MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit (SPHSU), University of Glasgow.\nTo support a range of analytical projects, a series of summary variables have been derived and included in the dataset. These include minutes spent in different categories of physical activity and variables indicating whether the child met the recommended Scottish Government guidelines of 60 minutes of physical activity each day (calculated in two forms: an average of 60 minutes per day overall valid days; a stricter measure of actual 60 minutes per day on each valid day)."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1a:T950,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"The Growing Up in Scotland (GUS) study is a large-scale longitudinal social survey which follows the lives of several groups of Scottish children from infancy through childhood and adolescence.
