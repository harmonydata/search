This cohort is one of three in the study, which aims to gather comprehensive data on the lives of children and their families in Scotland. The primary purpose of the study is to inform policymaking by providing insights into various aspects of children's development, health, and well-being. The study collects data through regular surveys and interviews with parents and caregivers, covering topics such as family circumstances, parenting, childcare, education, and health. The findings from Birth Cohort 1 have been instrumental in shaping policies related to child welfare and education in Scotland, offering valuable information to policymakers, practitioners, academics, and the voluntary sector. The study's longitudinal nature allows for the examination of changes and developments over time, providing a rich resource for understanding the factors that influence children's outcomes.16:Te47,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"The Growing Up in Scotland (GUS) study is a large-scale longitudinal social survey which follows the lives of several groups of Scottish children from infancy through childhood and adolescence, and aims to provide important new information on children and their families in Scotland.

SN 9120 - Growing Up in Scotland: Cohort 1, Sweep 8 Physical Activity Data, 2015-2016The Studying Physical Activity in Children's Environments across Scotland (SPACES) project aimed to investigate the ways in which the built, natural and social environment influences children's physical activity. The project employed an observational, cross-sectional design that sub-sampled from Birth Cohort 1 (BC1) of the GUS during the GUS Sweep 8 fieldwork. Children sub-sampled from GUS were invited to provide objectively measured physical activity data by wearing an accelerometer for eight days.This dataset provides a range of summary physical activity variables from this project. A total of 775 children provided valid data. As a sub sample of GUS BC1, the summary level physical activity data can be linked, where appropriate, to other GUS BC1 datasets held on UKDS at the individual level. The physical activity data were collected between May 2015 and May 2016 by the MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit (SPHSU), University of Glasgow.\nTo support a range of analytical projects, a series of summary variables have been derived and included in the dataset. These include minutes spent in different categories of physical activity and variables indicating whether the child met the recommended Scottish Government guidelines of 60 minutes of physical activity each day (calculated in two forms: an average of 60 minutes per day overall valid days; a stricter measure of actual 60 minutes per day on each valid day)."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1f:T950,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"The Growing Up in Scotland (GUS) study is a large-scale longitudinal social survey which follows the lives of several groups of Scottish children from infancy through childhood and adolescence.

The study forms a central part of the Scottish Government's strategy for the long-term monitoring and evaluation of its policies for children and young people, with a specific focus on the early years. The study seeks both to describe the characteristics, circumstances and experiences of children in their early years in Scotland and, through its longitudinal design, to generate a better understanding of how children's start in life can shape their longer term prospects and developmentSince 2005 fieldwork has been undertaken by the Scottish Centre for Social Research. The survey design for Birth Cohort 1 consisted of recruiting the parents of an initial total of 5,217 children aged 10 months old in 2005 and interviewing them annually until their child reached age six. Further fieldwork was then undertaken at ages 8, 10, 12, 14 and 17-18 with a sample boost added at age 12.Data for sweeps 1-9 were collected via an in-home, face-to-face interview with self-complete sections. Fieldwork for sweep 10 was disrupted due to the COVID pandemic. As a result, the final portion of the data was collected via web and telephone questionnaires. Sweep 11 data were gathered via web, telephone and face-to-face surveys of cohort members and their parent/carer.Further information about the survey may be found on the Growing Up in Scotland website.In May 20205, data and documentation for Cohort 1, Sweeps 1-11 were released as individual studies (SNs 9373-9383 and 9386-9387).

Removal of Geographical Variables and Spatial Unit Variable As of February 2018, at the data owner's request, the variables recording the 15% most deprived data zones, the 8 fold urban-rural classification and the Health Boards have been removed from all sweeps (where included). The variables removed are:\nSweep 1: ALaLow15, ALaHBdBc;Sweep 2: ALcLow15, ALcURin1, ALcHBdBc.\nNew edition informationFor the fourth edition (May 2019), an error in the Sweep 3 data has been correct (the SIMD variable ALeSNim2 has been inverted to match the variable included in previous sweeps). Sweep 1: household information; infant feeding; parenting support; non-resident parents; parenting styles and activities; childcare; child health and development; employment and economic activity; income and financial stress; education and identity; housing and accommodation; interviewer observations. The self-completion section covered: language and play skills of child; feelings parents might have when caring for young children; parental health; feelings in last four weeks; smoking, alcohol and drug use; relationships with family and friends.\nSweep 2 data were collected from the child's main carer: parenting; parent-child relationship; child's relationship with siblings; parental support and service use; non-resident parents; child health and development; activities (child and parent); child's diet; childcare; pre-school; transition to primary school; parental health and health behaviours; parental relationship; employment and education; income, expenditure and financial stress; housing and accommodation; neighbourhood and community.
