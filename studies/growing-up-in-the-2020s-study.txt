London WC1H 0ALEmail: clsdata@ucl.ac.ukOn this page:18:T581,The "Growing Up in the 2020s" study is a nationally representative longitudinal study focused on secondary school children in England. Commissioned by the Department for Education, it is part of the Education and Outcomes Panel Studies and is led by the mental health charity Anna Freud, in collaboration with the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) and Ipsos. The study aims to serve as a "barometer" for the wellbeing and educational outcomes of adolescents in England, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The study involves a sample of approximately 20,000 children aged 12-13 (Year 8) selected from the Department for Education’s National Pupil Database, with an emphasis on including pupils eligible for free school meals. It anticipates participation from around 7,750 children and parents at Wave 1, with about 4,000 paired child-parent interviews expected by Wave 4. Data collection will occur over four waves, involving young people, parents/carers, and teachers (in Waves 1 and 3). Topics covered include education, health, and economic records, with a specific substudy, Iris, tracking internet usage among a subsample of 400 young people.

The study is significant as it provides comprehensive insights into the development and educational outcomes of adolescents in the post-pandemic era, informing policy and interventions aimed at improving youth wellbeing and education.c:[["$","$L14",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$15"}}],["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":["$","$L16",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Growing Up in the 2020s study","description":"$17","url":["https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/growing-up-in-the-2020s-study/"],"keywords":[],"identifier":[],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies","url":"https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/"}]},"extra_data":{"instruments":[],"study_design":["cohort","longitudinal"],"source":["cls"],"language_codes":["en"],"start_year":null,"slug":"growing-up-in-the-2020s-study","dois":[],"data_access":null,"urls":["https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/growing-up-in-the-2020s-study/"],"harmony_id":"cls/growing-up-in-the-2020s-study","duration_years":null,"genetic_data_collected":false,"num_variables":null,"country_codes":["UK"],"name":"Growing Up in the 2020s study","ai_summary":"$18","sex":"all","geographic_coverage":"","resource_type":"study","end_year":null,"uuid":"2ffee6cd55cc2cf37cdfcd21b42d0e33"},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":true}]}]]
