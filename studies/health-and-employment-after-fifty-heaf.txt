The study recruited 8,000 participants from 24 British general practices that are part of the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). At the start of the study, participants completed a detailed questionnaire regarding their work and home circumstances. They are being followed up regularly over an initial period of five years, with their primary care health records accessed through the CPRD, given appropriate permissions.

The study focuses on understanding how changes in employment status, including the reasons for these changes, relate to changes in health, such as the onset of major illnesses, new treatments, and mortality. The findings from the HEAF study are intended to inform government policy and contribute to the design of work environments for older individuals. Additionally, the study seeks to identify measures that can support continued employment for older adults, particularly those facing health challenges. The insights gained are expected to be valuable in shaping strategies to enhance the employment prospects and well-being of the aging workforce.c:[["$","$L14",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$15"}}],["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":["$","$L16",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Health and Employment After Fifty (HEAF)","description":"The Health and Employment After Fifty (HEAF) study recruited 8000 adults aged 50–64 years from 24 British general practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). \n\nParticipants completed a questionnaire about their work and home circumstances at baseline, and were regularly followed-up, initially for a 5-year period.
