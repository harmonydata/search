The study involves approximately 16,000 participants and aims to understand the long-term health outcomes associated with military service, including deployment-related stressors and their impact on mental health. It also examines the transition to civilian life and the challenges faced by veterans after leaving the service. Key findings have highlighted the prevalence of mental health issues such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety among veterans, as well as the importance of support systems in facilitating successful reintegration into civilian society. The study's significance lies in its contribution to policy-making and the development of targeted interventions to support the health and wellbeing of military personnel and veterans.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Health and Wellbeing of UK Armed Forces Personnel: A Cohort Study","description":"The Health and Wellbeing of UK Armed Forces Personnel study is a large-scale investigation of the physical and psychological health of around 16,000 UK military veterans.
