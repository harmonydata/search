The study is also an opportunity to look at issues that are relevant to the Armed Forces in general, and how people manage once they leave

Health and Wellbeing of UK Armed Forces Personnel study is a comprehensive cohort study initiated in 2003 to assess the physical and psychological health of UK military veterans, particularly focusing on those who served in Iraq (Op TELIC) and later in Afghanistan (Op HERRICK). The study involves approximately 16,000 participants and aims to understand the long-term health outcomes associated with military service, including deployment-related stressors and their impact on mental health. It also examines the transition to civilian life and the challenges faced by veterans after leaving the service. Key findings have highlighted the prevalence of mental health issues such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety among veterans, as well as the importance of support systems in facilitating successful reintegration into civilian society. The study's significance lies in its contribution to policy-making and the development of targeted interventions to support the health and wellbeing of military personnel and veterans.a:[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$12"}}],["$","$L13",null,{"study":{"uuid":"72c737dbf9dedf6df7507584b67620f3","title":"Health and Wellbeing of UK Armed Forces Personnel: A Cohort Study","description":"The Health and Wellbeing of UK Armed Forces Personnel study is a large-scale investigation of the physical and psychological health of around 16,000 UK military veterans.
