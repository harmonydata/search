Study website: https://www.mrc.soton.ac.uk/herts/16:T550,The Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS) is a unique longitudinal study involving 3,000 men and women born between 1931 and 1939 in Hertfordshire, UK. Conducted by the MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit at the University of Southampton, the study aims to investigate the impact of early life growth, genetic factors, and adult lifestyle on the risk of developing age-related diseases such as osteoporosis, sarcopenia, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. 

The study utilizes historical birth and infant data, including birth weight, weight at age one, infant feeding methods, and childhood illnesses, which were recorded by healthcare professionals at the time. Participants have been followed up with comprehensive assessments of their medical and social histories, physical measurements, blood pressure, glucose tolerance, cholesterol levels, bone density, and physical performance. DNA samples have been collected from all participants for genetic analysis.

The HCS provides valuable insights into how early life factors influence health outcomes in later life, contributing to the understanding of the developmental origins of health and disease. The continuous tracking of participants through the NHS Central Register allows for ongoing data collection and analysis, enhancing the study's ability to inform public health strategies and interventions.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS)","description":"$15","url":["https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.mrcleu-uos.hcs/d20a56d4-22e8-4d70-99cd-1d3a063073b1","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=HCS","https://www.mrc.soton.ac.uk/herts/"],"keywords":["Reproductive health","Biomarkers","Diet and nutrition","Cognitive measures","Neighbourhood","Housing","Sleep problems","Loneliness and social isolation","Work and employment","Social care -

17:T58b,The Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS) comprises a nationally unique study of 3,000 men and women born during the period 1931-1939 and still resident in the English county of Hertfordshire during the 1990s. The HCS was initiated, developed and maintained by the MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton.

The principal objective of the study is to evaluate the relationship between early (prenatal and early postnatal) growth, genetic influences, adult lifestyles and the risk of common age-related disorders such as osteoporosis, sarcopenia, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 

The NHS Central Register at Southport was used to trace men and women whose birth and infant data were recorded. Information available on these individuals includes birth weight (recorded by the attending midwife), weight at age one year (recorded by a health visitor), the method of infant feeding, and details of childhood illnesses up to age five years.

At follow-up, medical and social histories have been ascertained, as well as detailed anthropometry, blood pressure, glucose tolerance, fasting serum cholesterol and triglycerides, bone density and physical performance. DNA on all participants has been collected and is stored in the Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit. Participants are flagged for continuous notification of death on the NHS Central Register.
