It involves a collaboration of research teams from multiple European cities, including London, Nottingham, Dublin, Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, Mannheim, and Dresden. The study tracks 2,000 adolescents and their parents, starting from the age of 14, to investigate key aspects of adolescent behavior such as sensitivity to rewards, impulsivity, and emotional processing.

The methodology of the IMAGEN study includes collecting a wide range of data: brain imaging data, cognitive and behavioral assessments, questionnaires, and blood samples. This multi-faceted approach allows researchers to explore the complex interactions between genetic, neurobiological, and environmental factors that influence adolescent development.

Key findings from the IMAGEN study have contributed to a deeper understanding of how genetic and environmental factors affect brain structure and function during adolescence. The study has provided insights into the neural mechanisms underlying behaviors such as impulsivity and reward sensitivity, which are critical during this developmental period.

The significance of the IMAGEN study lies in its potential to inform interventions and policies aimed at promoting mental health and well-being in adolescents. By identifying the biological and environmental factors that contribute to mental health disorders, the study can help in developing targeted prevention and treatment strategies.c:[["$","$L14",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$15"}}],["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":["$","$L16",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"IMAGEN","description":"The IMAGEN study is a large‐scale, longitudinal, imaging genetic study that combines brain imaging, genetics, and psychiatry to increase our understanding of adolescent brain development and behaviour – namely, sensitivity to rewards, impulsivity, and emotional processing.
