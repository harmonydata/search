The study is divided into two phases: IMAGINE-1 (2015-2020) and IMAGINE-2 (2020-2024), and involves two main cohorts located at University College London and Cardiff University.

The primary aim of IMAGINE ID is to investigate how specific genetic changes contribute to intellectual disabilities and associated behavioral and mental health issues. By doing so, the study seeks to provide valuable insights that can improve the care and support provided to affected families and children.

The methodology involves detailed genetic analyses, behavioral assessments, and mental health evaluations of participants. The study collects and analyzes data over time to observe how genetic factors influence developmental trajectories and mental health outcomes.

Key findings from the study have highlighted the complex relationship between genetic variations and neurodevelopmental disorders, emphasizing the need for personalized approaches in treatment and care. The research has also underscored the importance of integrating genetic information into clinical practice to better support individuals with intellectual disabilities.

The significance of the IMAGINE ID study lies in its potential to transform the understanding of intellectual disabilities and mental health, paving the way for more targeted interventions and improved quality of life for affected individuals and their families.c:[["$","$L14",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$15"}}],["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":["$","$L16",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Intellectual Disability and Mental Health: Assessing the Genomic Impact on Neurodevelopment (IMAGINE ID)","description":"The Intellectual Disability and Mental Health: Assessing the Genomic Impact on Neurodevelopment (IMAGINE ID) is a national longitudinal cohort study on the genetic causes of intellectual disability.
