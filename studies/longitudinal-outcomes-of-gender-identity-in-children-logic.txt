The study focuses on understanding the prevalence of ongoing gender dysphoria, the factors influencing medical treatment decisions, and the impact of medical treatment, social transition, and co-occurring autism on various aspects of life, including physical health, well-being, quality of life, and relationships. It also considers the economic implications for the NHS and other public services. Participants include children, young people, and their parents or caregivers, who are followed over time regardless of their continued engagement with clinical services.

The qualitative component, LOGIC-Q, delves into the personal experiences and well-being of a diverse group of children, young people, and their parents over a two-year period. It aims to understand the evolving experiences of gender identity, the support needs of parents, and the perspectives on health service outcomes. Additionally, it seeks to gather insights into the experiences with health services and how these can be improved. This comprehensive approach provides valuable insights into the factors affecting gender-diverse children and their families, informing better support and treatment strategies.c:[["$","$L16",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$17"}}],["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":["$","$L18",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Longitudinal Outcomes of Gender Identity in Children (LOGIC)","description":"$19","url":["https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=LOGIC",""],"keywords":["Biomarkers","Loneliness and social isolation","Puberty","Physical health assessment","Reproductive health","Sexuality and gender identity","Victimisation and life events"],"identifier":["https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192113883","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047875","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045628"],"variableMeasured":"$undefined","includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=LOGIC","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"}],"publisher":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"University College London (UCL), Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, University of Liverpool, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Cambridge.
