Specifically, the study aims to establish: (1) the proportion of children and young people who experience ongoing gender dysphoria and access medical treatment; (2) factors that are associated with ongoing gender dysphoria and treatment choice; and (3) how (A) medical treatment, (B) social transition and (C) co-occurring autism impact physical health, well-being, quality of life, peer and family relationships and cost to the National Health Service (NHS) and other public services.  \n\nThe study has recruited children, young people and parents/caregivers prior to being seen by the service and is committed to following them over time, regardless of whether families choose to remain in contact with clinical services or not. \n\nThe qualitative sub-study of LOGIC, LOGIC-Q, aims to explore the experiences and well-being of a diverse sample of children and young people referred to the UK GIDS, and their parent/caregiver over a 2-year period. Specifically, the study aims to explore and examine (1) children and young people's experiences of gender identity, how this changes over time and links to health and well-being; (2) parental experiences of having a gender-questioning child, how this changes over time and support needed to promote their child's health and well-being; (3) children, young people and parental perspectives on outcomes that are important for evaluating health services and treatments for gender-diverse children; (4) children, young people and parental experiences of health services, therapies and support and how these can be enhanced.","url":"https://discoverynext.vercel.app/studies/longitudinal-outcomes-of-gender-identity-in-children-logic","keywords":["Biomarkers","Loneliness and social isolation","Puberty","Physical health assessment","Reproductive health","Sexuality and gender identity","Victimisation and life events"],"identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045628"],"variableMeasured":[{"name":"My life would be meaningless I would have to live as a boy","options":["Disagree completely","Disagree somewhat","Neutral","Agree somewhat","Agree completely"]},{"name":"Every time someone treats me like a boy I feel hurt","options":["Disagree completely","Disagree somewhat","Neutral","Agree somewhat","Agree completely"]},{"name":"I feel unhappy if someone calls me a boy","options":["Disagree completely","Disagree somewhat","Neutral","Agree somewhat","Agree completely"]},{"name":"I feel unhappy because I have a male body","options":["Disagree completely","Disagree somewhat","Neutral","Agree somewhat","Agree completely"]},{"name":"The idea that I will always be a boy gives me a sinking feeling","options":["Disagree completely","Disagree somewhat","Neutral","Agree somewhat","Agree completely"]},{"name":"I hate myself because I am a boy","options":["Disagree completely","Disagree somewhat","Neutral","Agree somewhat","Agree completely"]},{"name":"I feel uncomfortable behaving like a boy, always and everywhere","options":["Disagree completely","Disagree somewhat","Neutral","Agree somewhat","Agree completely"]},{"name":"Only as a girl/woman my life would be worth living","options":["Disagree completely","Disagree somewhat","Neutral","Agree somewhat","Agree completely"]},{"name":"I dislike urinating in a standing position","options":["Disagree completely","Disagree somewhat","Neutral","Agree somewhat","Agree completely"]},{"name":"I am dissatisfied with my beard growth because it makes me look like a boy/man","options":["Disagree completely","Disagree somewhat","Neutral","Agree somewhat","Agree completely"]},{"name":"I dislike having erections","options":["Disagree completely","Disagree somewhat","Neutral","Agree somewhat","Agree completely"]},{"name":"It would be better not to live than to live as a boy","options":["Disagree completely","Disagree somewhat","Neutral","Agree somewhat","Agree completely"]},{"name":"I try to be nice to other people, I care about their feelings","options":["Not true","Somewhat true","Certainly true"]},{"name":"I am restless, I cannot stay still for long","options":["Not true","Somewhat true","Certainly true"]},{"name":"I get a lot of headaches, stomach-aches or sickness","options":["Not true","Somewhat true","Certainly true"]},{"name":"I usually share with others (food, games, pens etc)","options":["Not true","Somewhat true","Certainly true"]},{"name":"I get very angry and often lose my temper","options":["Not true","Somewhat true","Certainly true"]},{"name":"I am usually on my own.

Specifically, the study aims to establish: (1) the proportion of children and young people who experience ongoing gender dysphoria and access medical treatment; (2) factors that are associated with ongoing gender dysphoria and treatment choice; and (3) how (A) medical treatment, (B) social transition and (C) co-occurring autism impact physical health, well-being, quality of life, peer and family relationships and cost to the National Health Service (NHS) and other public services.  

The study has recruited children, young people and parents/caregivers prior to being seen by the service and is committed to following them over time, regardless of whether families choose to remain in contact with clinical services or not. 

The qualitative sub-study of LOGIC, LOGIC-Q, aims to explore the experiences and well-being of a diverse sample of children and young people referred to the UK GIDS, and their parent/caregiver over a 2-year period. Specifically, the study aims to explore and examine (1) children and young people's experiences of gender identity, how this changes over time and links to health and well-being; (2) parental experiences of having a gender-questioning child, how this changes over time and support needed to promote their child's health and well-being; (3) children, young people and parental perspectives on outcomes that are important for evaluating health services and treatments for gender-diverse children; (4) children, young people and parental experiences of health services, therapies and support and how these can be enhanced.8:[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$10"}}],["$","$L11",null,{"study":{"title":"Longitudinal Outcomes of Gender Identity in Children (LOGIC)","description":"$12","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/LOGIC.png","publisher":{"name":"University College London (UCL), Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, University of Liverpool, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Cambridge.

13:T6ce,This study aims to investigate the outcomes of children and young people referred to the UK Gender Identity Development Service and the factors associated with these outcomes. Specifically, the study aims to establish: (1) the proportion of children and young people who experience ongoing gender dysphoria and access medical treatment; (2) factors that are associated with ongoing gender dysphoria and treatment choice; and (3) how (A) medical treatment, (B) social transition and (C) co-occurring autism impact physical health, well-being, quality of life, peer and family relationships and cost to the National Health Service (NHS) and other public services.  

The study has recruited children, young people and parents/caregivers prior to being seen by the service and is committed to following them over time, regardless of whether families choose to remain in contact with clinical services or not. 

The qualitative sub-study of LOGIC, LOGIC-Q, aims to explore the experiences and well-being of a diverse sample of children and young people referred to the UK GIDS, and their parent/caregiver over a 2-year period. Specifically, the study aims to explore and examine (1) children and young people's experiences of gender identity, how this changes over time and links to health and well-being; (2) parental experiences of having a gender-questioning child, how this changes over time and support needed to promote their child's health and well-being; (3) children, young people and parental perspectives on outcomes that are important for evaluating health services and treatments for gender-diverse children; (4) children, young people and parental experiences of health services, therapies and support and how these can be enhanced.14:T6ce,This study aims to investigate the outcomes of children and young people referred to the UK Gender Identity Development Service and the factors associated with these outcomes.
