The qualitative sub-study of LOGIC, LOGIC-Q, aims to explore the experiences and well-being of a diverse sample of children and young people referred to the UK GIDS, and their parent/caregiver over a 2-year period.

The study aims to determine the proportion of these individuals who continue to experience gender dysphoria and seek medical treatment, as well as identify factors influencing these outcomes. It also examines the impact of medical treatment, social transition, and co-occurring autism on various aspects of life, including physical health, well-being, quality of life, relationships, and the cost to the NHS and other public services.

Participants, including children, young people, and their parents or caregivers, are recruited before their first service appointment and are followed over time, regardless of their continued engagement with clinical services. This longitudinal approach allows for a detailed analysis of the evolving experiences and needs of gender-diverse youth and their families.

The qualitative sub-study, LOGIC-Q, delves deeper into the personal experiences and well-being of a diverse sample of participants over a two-year period. It explores changes in gender identity experiences, parental perspectives, and the support required to promote health and well-being. Additionally, it gathers insights into the effectiveness of health services and treatments from the perspectives of both the children and their parents, aiming to enhance the support provided to gender-diverse children and their families.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Longitudinal Outcomes of Gender Identity in Children (LOGIC)","description":"$15","url":["https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=LOGIC","https://logicstudy.uk/"],"keywords":["Biomarkers","Loneliness and social isolation","Puberty","Physical health assessment","Reproductive health","Sexuality and gender identity","Victimisation and life events"],"identifier":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045628"],"variableMeasured":"$undefined","includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"Catalogue of Mental Health Measures","url":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=LOGIC","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/sitelogo.png"}],"publisher":[{"@type":"Organization","name":"University College London (UCL), Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, University of Liverpool, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Cambridge.
