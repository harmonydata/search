This survey originally tested the intelligence of nearly all children born in 1921 and attending school in Scotland. The LBC1921 study aims to explore the factors influencing cognitive aging by re-assessing these individuals later in life. Participants have been followed up with multiple waves of data collection, including cognitive tests, health assessments, and lifestyle questionnaires. The study's primary focus is on understanding non-pathological cognitive aging, rather than dementia or other cognitive disorders. Key findings from the LBC1921 have contributed to the understanding of how early-life intelligence, health, and lifestyle factors influence cognitive abilities in older age. The study is significant for its unique longitudinal design, allowing researchers to track cognitive changes over an extensive period and providing insights into the aging process.","duration_years":81,"name":"Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 (LBC1921)","num_variables":10,"country_codes":["GB"],"dois":["https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyr197","https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyy022"],"age_upper":11,"source":["mhc"],"geographic_coverage":"Scotland","resource_type":"study","genetic_data_collected":true,"start_year":1932,"language_codes":["en"],"instruments":["Satisfaction With Life Scale (5-item) (SWLS)","Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)","Pearlin Self-Mastery Scale (7-item)","Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (10-item) (RSES)","Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS)","World Health Organisation Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF)","International Personality Item Pool (IPIP)"],"slug":"lothian-birth-cohort-1921-lbc1921","end_year":2013,"data_access":"Data request - see data access guidance <br> \n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/lothian-birth-cohorts/data-access-collaboration\">ed.ac.uk/lothian-birth-cohorts/data-access-collaboration</a>","age_lower":10,"harmony_id":"mhc/lbc1921","uuid":"dc65eb999e78ce5e2de4e22234eceb0c","number_of_variables":80},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"variables_which_matched":"$undefined"},"studyDataComplete":false}]]
