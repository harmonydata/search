This survey originally tested the intelligence of nearly all children born in 1921 and attending school in Scotland. The LBC1921 study aims to explore the factors influencing cognitive aging by re-assessing these individuals later in life. The study focuses on non-pathological cognitive aging, rather than dementia or other cognitive disorders, providing insights into how cognitive abilities change over the lifespan. Participants have been assessed on various cognitive, health, and lifestyle factors, allowing researchers to investigate the influences of genetics, environment, and lifestyle on cognitive aging. The findings from LBC1921 have contributed significantly to understanding the aging process, highlighting the roles of early-life intelligence, education, and health behaviors in maintaining cognitive function in older age.","data_access":"Data request - see data access guidance <br> \n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/lothian-birth-cohorts/data-access-collaboration\">ed.ac.uk/lothian-birth-cohorts/data-access-collaboration</a>","resource_type":"study","dois":["https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyr197","https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyy022"],"end_year":null,"genetic_data_collected":false,"urls":["","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=LBC1921","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=LBC1936"],"harmony_id":"mhc/lbc1921","start_year":1932,"country_codes":["GB"],"uuid":"dc65eb999e78ce5e2de4e22234eceb0c","number_of_variables":102},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"variables_which_matched":"$undefined"},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":false}]]
