The study was initiated to investigate the effects of various lifestyle and health factors on the risk of developing common and serious illnesses, with a particular focus on conditions that become more prevalent as women age. These include cancer, dementia, osteoporosis, stroke, and other severe disabling conditions.

The study collects data through initial questionnaires and follows participants' health outcomes mainly via linkage to NHS records, allowing for comprehensive tracking of health events over time. Additionally, re-surveys are conducted to update information on lifestyle and health status.

Key findings from the Million Women Study have contributed significantly to understanding the impact of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on breast cancer risk, the effects of lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption on various health outcomes, and the role of reproductive history in disease risk. The study's large sample size and long follow-up period provide robust evidence that informs public health guidelines and policy decisions related to women's health.a:[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$12"}}],["$","$L13",null,{"study":{"uuid":"269f2a6ba0228caeb32b54b0e06b6383","title":"The Million Women Study","description":"The Million Women Study is a population-based cohort study of 1.3 million women born in 1935-1950 with the aim of providing reliable information on potentially modifiable causes of common and serious illnesses.
