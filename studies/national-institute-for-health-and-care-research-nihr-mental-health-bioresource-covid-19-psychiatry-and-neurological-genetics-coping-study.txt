The study focuses on understanding how the pandemic has influenced psychiatric and neurological disorders, potentially exacerbating existing conditions or contributing to new ones. It utilizes genetic data to explore the biological underpinnings of these impacts, aiming to identify genetic factors that may influence susceptibility to mental health issues in the context of COVID-19. The study's findings are significant for informing healthcare strategies and interventions to address the mental health challenges posed by the pandemic, as well as for advancing the understanding of the genetic basis of psychiatric and neurological responses to global health crises."}}]]
