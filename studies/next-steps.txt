Study website: www.cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/next-steps16:T4c1,Next Steps, originally known as the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE1), is a comprehensive longitudinal cohort study that tracks the lives of approximately 16,000 individuals in England born in 1989-1990. Initiated in 2004, the study was initially managed by the Department for Education and later transferred to the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) in 2013. The study's primary focus is on educational transitions, and it includes annual interviews conducted from 2004 to 2010, covering ages 14 to 20, with additional interviews with parents during the first four sweeps. The study is enriched by data from the National Pupil Database.

In 2013, CLS revitalized the study, conducting a new wave of data collection at age 25 (in 2015/2016), expanding its scope to include a multidisciplinary research approach. This phase included a wide range of administrative data linkages and achieved interviews with nearly 8,000 participants, ensuring the sample remained representative. The study provides valuable insights into the educational and social trajectories of young people in England, making it a significant resource for understanding the factors influencing educational and life outcomes.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Next Steps","description":"$15","url":["","https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/next-steps/","https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/next-steps/)","https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.cls.nextsteps/f25cb910-efa6-4938-b360-73f3f65d88a7","https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=NEXTSTEP","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=LSYPE"],"keywords":["Victimisation and life events","Social care -

17:T4d5,Next Steps (previously known as the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE1)) is a large and nationally representative longitudinal cohort study following the lives of around 16,000 people in England born in 1989-1990.

The study started in 2004 and was funded and managed by the Department for Education until it transferred to CLS in 2013. Annual interviews with study members were carried out between 2004 and 2010 (ages 14 to 20), as well as interviews with parents for the first four sweeps. The study focused primarily on educational transitions and was supplemented by linked administrative data from the National Pupil Database. Following the initial survey at age 13-14, the cohort members were interviewed every year until 2010.

In 2013 CLS successfully re-started the study and collected another sweep of data at age 25 (in 2015/2016). The scientific content of the study was broadened to provide a multidisciplinary research resource, supplemented by a wide-range of administrative data linkage consents. Extensive efforts were made to maximise the size and representativeness of the sample and interviews were achieved with almost 8,000 study members.
