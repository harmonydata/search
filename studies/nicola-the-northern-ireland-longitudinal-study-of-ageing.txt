As the first large-scale longitudinal study of its kind in the region, NICOLA aims to provide valuable insights into the ageing process and its implications on individuals and society. The study collects data on a wide range of variables, including physical and mental health, social connections, economic circumstances, and lifestyle factors. By following participants over time, NICOLA seeks to identify patterns and predictors of successful ageing, inform policy development, and improve health and social care services. The findings from NICOLA are expected to contribute significantly to the development of strategies and interventions that enhance the quality of life for older adults in Northern Ireland.","sex":"all","resource_type":"study","dois":[],"end_year":null,"genetic_data_collected":false,"harmony_id":"ukllc/nicola","data_access":null,"start_year":2014,"uuid":"51d0c91ede2889bc8b457c939023e599"},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":true}]]
