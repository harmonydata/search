The study aims to identify how these variables contribute to mental health risks during adolescence. A key aspect of ROOTS is its exploration of genetically influenced biological markers, such as endophenotypes and biomarkers, which may precede or predict risk markers for mental illnesses. By examining these intermediate biological factors, the study seeks to identify early indicators of mental health issues, potentially allowing for earlier intervention and prevention strategies. The findings from ROOTS are significant as they contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex etiology of mental health disorders and the potential for personalized approaches to mental health care."},"isLoadingEnhancedData":true,"originalSearchResult":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"The ROOTS Study","description":"The ROOTS study is a longitudinal study of teenagers established in 2006 to evaluate the relative contributions of defined genetic, physiological, psychological and social variables, occurring at different stages of child development, to the overall risk for psychopathology during adolescence.

The study aims to identify how these variables contribute to mental health risks during adolescence. A key aspect of ROOTS is its exploration of genetically influenced biological markers, such as endophenotypes and biomarkers, which may precede or predict risk markers for mental illnesses. By examining these intermediate biological factors, the study seeks to identify early indicators of mental health issues, potentially allowing for earlier intervention and prevention strategies. The findings from ROOTS are significant as they contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex etiology of mental health disorders and the potential for personalized approaches to mental health care.","dois":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-015-1150-y","https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyp173"],"name":"The ROOTS Study","num_variables":37,"country_codes":["GB"],"duration_years":10,"source":["mhc"],"geographic_coverage":"England","resource_type":"study","genetic_data_collected":true,"start_year":2006,"sample_size":1185,"instruments":"$a:1:props:study:instruments","slug":"roots-study","end_year":2016,"data_access":"Data request - contact study team<br>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nspn.org.uk/contact-us/\">www.nspn.org.uk/contact-us</a>","age_lower":14,"harmony_id":"mhc/roots","uuid":"0f17853f573e6feb4fb97e0e6b016174","number_of_variables":310},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]}}]]
