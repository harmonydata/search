The study aims to identify how these variables contribute to mental health risks during adolescence. A key aspect of ROOTS is its exploration of genetically influenced biological markers, such as endophenotypes and biomarkers, which may precede or predict risk markers for mental illnesses. By examining these intermediate biological factors, the study seeks to identify early indicators of mental health issues, potentially allowing for earlier intervention and prevention strategies. The findings from ROOTS are significant as they contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex etiology of mental health disorders and the potential for personalized approaches to mental health care.","dois":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-015-1150-y","https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyp173"],"name":"The ROOTS Study","num_variables":37,"country_codes":["GB"],"duration_years":10,"source":["mhc"],"geographic_coverage":"England","resource_type":"study","genetic_data_collected":true,"start_year":2006,"sample_size":1185,"instruments":["Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 - Module E (SCID-5-RV)","Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ)","Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 - Modules A & D (SCID-5-RV)","Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (10-item) (RSES)","Snaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale (14-item) (SHAPS)","Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (28-item) (RCMAS)","Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, present and lifetime version (K-SADS-PL)","Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU)","Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (10-item) (K10)","Schizotypal Symptoms Inventory (SSI)","Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 - Modules F, G, I, K, L (SCID-5-RV)","Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (14-item) (WEMWBS)","Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire - Brief (SPQ-B)","Cambridge Early Experiences Interview (CAMEEI)","Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (30-item) (BIS-11)","Psychotic-like Symptom Interview (PLIKSi)","Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 - Modules B & C (SCID-5-RV)","Emotionality Activity Sociability Temperament Survey for Children (EAS)","Drug, Alcohol and Self Injury Questionnaire (DASI)","Antisocial Behaviours Questionnaire (11-items) (ABQ)","Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (25-item) (SDQ)","Short Leyton Obsessional Inventory - Child Version (SLOI-SV)","Antisocial Process Screening Device (20-item) (APSD)","MINI-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)"],"slug":"roots-study","end_year":2016,"data_access":"Data request - contact study team<br>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nspn.org.uk/contact-us/\">www.nspn.org.uk/contact-us</a>","age_lower":14,"harmony_id":"mhc/roots","uuid":"0f17853f573e6feb4fb97e0e6b016174","number_of_variables":310},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"variables_which_matched":"$undefined"},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":false}]]
