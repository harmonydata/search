The study aims to examine the impact socioeconomic factors such as income or education have on people’s health, as well to understand if other demographic factors such as age, culture, ethnicity and/or residence make a difference for people’s wellbeing. The population of Southwark and Lambeth is highly diverse in terms of ethnicity and wealth, ensuring that the study encompasses as wide a range of health service users as
