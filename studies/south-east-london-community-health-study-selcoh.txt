The population of Southwark and Lambeth is highly diverse in terms of ethnicity and wealth, ensuring that the study encompasses as wide a range of health service users as

The study aims to explore how socioeconomic factors like income and education, as well as demographic factors such as age, culture, ethnicity, and residence, influence health outcomes. Given the diverse population in terms of ethnicity and socioeconomic status in these areas, the study provides valuable insights into the health disparities and needs of a wide range of health service users. The findings from SELCoH are significant for informing public health strategies and policies tailored to the needs of diverse urban populations."}}]]
