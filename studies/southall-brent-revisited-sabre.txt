Initially, the study aimed to investigate the causes of diabetes and cardiovascular disorders, given the varying prevalence and risk factors across these ethnic groups. The study's scope was later expanded to include cognitive function assessments during follow-up stages, recognizing the importance of understanding ethnic differences in cognitive aging and related health outcomes.

The SABRE study employs a range of methodologies, including clinical assessments, questionnaires, and biological measurements, to gather comprehensive data on participants' health status, lifestyle, and socio-demographic factors. Key findings from the study have highlighted significant ethnic disparities in the prevalence and risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. For instance, Indian Asian participants were found to have a higher risk of developing diabetes, while African Caribbean individuals showed different patterns of cardiovascular risk factors compared to Europeans.

The inclusion of cognitive function in later stages of the study has provided valuable insights into how these health disparities might influence cognitive aging and the risk of dementia across different ethnic groups. The SABRE study's findings have important implications for public health policies and interventions aimed at reducing health inequalities and improving health outcomes in diverse populations.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Southall & Brent Revisited (SABRE)","description":"The Southall And Brent REvisited (SABRE) study is the largest tri-ethnic population-based cohort in the UK, involving nearly 5,000 European, Indian Asian and African Caribbean men and women.
