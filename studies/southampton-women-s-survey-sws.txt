The study initially recruited women aged 20-34 years between 1998 and 2002, before they became pregnant, to gather comprehensive data on their health, diet, lifestyle, and social circumstances. The survey is notable for its pre-conceptional recruitment, which allows researchers to study the impact of maternal factors on pregnancy outcomes and child development.

The methodology includes home visits by trained research nurses who collect detailed information through interviews and physical measurements. A subset of participants undergo additional assessments such as Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to measure bone density and body composition, spirometry to assess lung function, and cognitive testing.

Key findings from the SWS have contributed significantly to understanding how maternal nutrition and lifestyle before and during pregnancy affect fetal growth and development, as well as long-term health outcomes for both mothers and children. The study has highlighted the importance of maternal health and nutrition in the pre-conception period and has informed public health policies and interventions aimed at improving maternal and child health.

The SWS is significant for its comprehensive approach and its contribution to the field of developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD), providing valuable insights into how early life factors influence health trajectories across the lifespan.c:[["$","$L16",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$17"}}],["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":["$","$L18",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Southampton Women's Survey (SWS)","description":"Participants were visited and home by a trained research nurse.
