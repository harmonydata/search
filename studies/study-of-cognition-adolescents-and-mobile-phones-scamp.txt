The primary focus of SCAMP is to investigate the potential associations between exposure to radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) from mobile phones and other wireless devices, and various outcomes in adolescents. These outcomes include cognitive development, behavioral patterns, educational achievements, and physical and mental health. By examining these associations, SCAMP seeks to provide valuable insights into how modern technology might influence adolescent development and well-being, contributing to the broader understanding of technology's impact on health.","language_codes":["en"],"name":"The Study of Cognition, Adolescents and Mobile Phones (SCAMP)","num_variables":8,"country_codes":["GB"],"duration_years":null,"genetic_data_collected":true,"geographic_coverage":"England","resource_type":"study","source":["mhc"],"start_year":2014,"sample_size":6616,"instruments":["Patient Health Questionnaire (9-item) (PHQ-9)","The Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences-Positive Scale (15-item) (CAPE-P15)","Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (25-item + 5-item impact supplement) (SDQ)","KIDSCREEN-10 Index (10-item)","Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (7-item) (GAD-7)"],"slug":"study-of-cognition-adolescents-and-mobile-phones-scamp","end_year":null,"data_access":"Project proposal - see data access guidance <br>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.scampstudy.org/research-opportunities/\">https://www.scampstudy.org/research-opportunities/</a>","harmony_id":"mhc/scamp","age_lower":11,"uuid":"ab20639fd0672a06ae15ea02cf7b8796","number_of_variables":78},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"variables_which_matched":"$undefined"},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":false}]]
