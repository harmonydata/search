These specific surveys targeted adults in mental health institutions (1994), homeless individuals (1994), prisoners (1997), and children and young people under local authority care (2001/2). The methodology typically involved structured interviews and standardized diagnostic tools to evaluate mental health conditions and associated social challenges. Key findings highlighted higher rates of psychiatric disorders in these populations compared to the general public, underscoring the need for tailored mental health services and policy interventions. These surveys are significant as they provide critical insights into the mental health needs of marginalized groups, informing public health strategies and resource allocation to better support these vulnerable populations.","duration_years":7,"name":"Surveys of Psychiatric Morbidity - marginalised populations","num_variables":33,"country_codes":["GB"],"dois":["https://doi.org/10.1017/S003329179700531X","https://doi.org/10.1080/0954026021000046047 "],"genetic_data_collected":false,"geographic_coverage":"England, Scotland, Wales","resource_type":"study","source":["mhc"],"start_year":1994,"urls":["https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=APMS_other","https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/series/series?id=2000044"],"instruments":["Hare Psychopathy Checklist (20-item) (PCL-R)","Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) (Psychosis)","Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders - Self-Completion (SCID-II) (Narcissistic Personality Disorder)","Development and Wellbeing Assessment (Awkward and truoblesome behaviour section only) (DAWBA)","Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders - Self-Completion (SCID-II) (Avoidant Personality Disorder)","Strengths & Difficulties Questionnaire (25-item + 6-item Impact Supplement) (SDQ)","Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders - Self-Completion (SCID-II) (Depressive Personality Disorder)","Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders - Self-Completion (SCID-II) (Histrionic Personality Disorder)","Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders - Self-Completion (SCID-II) (Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder)","Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders - Self-Completion (SCID-II) (Conduct Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder)","Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders - Self-Completion (SCID-II) (Schizoid Personality Disorder)","Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (10-item) (AUDIT-10)","Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders - Self-Completion (SCID-II) (Dependent Personality Disorder)","Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders - Self-Completion (SCID-II) (Paranoid Personality Disorder)","Strengths & Difficulties Questionnaire (25-item + impact supplement, teacher version) (SDQ)","Short Mood & Feelings Questionnaire (13-item) (SMFQ)","General Health Questionnaire (12-item) (GHQ-12)","Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders - Self-Completion (SCID-II) (Borderline Personality Disorder)","Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA)","Psychosis Screening Questionnaire (PSQ)","Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA) - strengths scale only","Clinical Interview Schedule - Revised (CIS-R)","Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders - Self-Completion (SCID-II) (Passive Agressive Personality Disorder)","Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence","Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders - Self-Completion (SCID-II) (Schizotypal Personality Disorder)"],"slug":"surveys-of-psychiatric-morbidity-marginalised-populations","end_year":2001,"data_access":"UK Data Service <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/series/series?id=2000044\">beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/series/series?id=2000044</a>","age_lower":16,"harmony_id":"mhc/apms_other","uuid":"feafb714c6bc8621c2223ef887ad0a8b","number_of_variables":380},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"variables_which_matched":"$undefined"},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":false}]]
