These surveys have been conducted across various populations, including adults in private households, children and adolescents, and marginalized groups such as those in mental health institutions, homeless individuals, prisoners, and children in local authority care. The surveys aim to provide comprehensive data on mental health issues, helping to inform public health initiatives and policy decisions. The studies conducted in 1993, 2000, 2007, and 2014 focused on adults in private households, while those in 1999, 2004, and 2017 targeted children and adolescents. Additionally, specific surveys in 1994, 1997, and 2001/2 examined psychiatric morbidity in institutionalized adults, homeless populations, prisoners, and children under local authority care. These surveys are crucial for understanding the scope of mental health challenges in Britain and for developing targeted interventions.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Surveys of Psychiatric Morbidity","description":"The Surveys of Psychiatric Morbidity aim to provide information about the prevalence of psychiatric problems among people in Great Britain, as well as their associated social disabilities and use of services.
