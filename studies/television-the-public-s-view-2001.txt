2b:T5bc,The Television : the Public's View annual survey series was started in 1992, to help the Independent Television Commission (ITC - then regulator of commercial television in the UK) to collect data on the public's attitudes to television, in order to fulfil its obligations to conduct research as enshrined in the 1990 Broadcasting Act. During 2003, the ITC, Broadcasting Standards Commission (BSC) and the Radio Authority (RA) merged to form Ofcom, who are now responsible for the surveys. To reflect the inclusion of the RA within Ofcom and the advent of new broadcasting technologies, the most recent years of the survey now also include information on radio programmes, and the internet.

The surveys comprise the results of interviews with members of the general public in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, conducted face-to-face in their homes, using CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing) technology. The main objectives of the survey include monitoring trends in the following over time:
ownership of new technology (particularly digital and multi-channel television);
most valued television channels, and attitudes towards the programmes broadcast;
levels of offence caused by programmes or advertising on the television or radio;
awareness of the watershed and the organisations responsible for monitoring broadcast quality;
use of and attitudes towards the internet.

Further information about research conducted may be found on the Ofcom web site.27:["$","meta","14",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"$2b"}]
