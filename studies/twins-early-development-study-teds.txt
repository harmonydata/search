It is one of the largest twin studies globally, with over 16,000 twin pairs initially enrolled. The primary aim of TEDS is to explore the genetic and environmental influences on various aspects of human development, including cognitive abilities, behavior, and health. By studying twins, researchers can disentangle the effects of genetics and environment, as twins share varying degrees of genetic similarity. TEDS has contributed significantly to understanding how genetic and environmental factors interact to influence traits such as intelligence, educational achievement, and mental health. The study employs a range of methodologies, including behavioral assessments, questionnaires, and DNA analysis. Its findings have important implications for education, psychology, and public health, providing insights into the nature versus nurture debate and informing interventions and policies aimed at improving developmental outcomes.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Twins Early Development Study (TEDS)","description":"The Twin Early Development Study (TEDS) is one of the leading large-scale twin studies in the world.
