The study collects extensive phenotypic and genotypic data, allowing researchers to explore a wide array of health conditions, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and musculoskeletal diseases, as well as aging and microbiome studies. TwinsUK has contributed significantly to understanding the heritability of various traits and diseases, providing insights into the interplay between genetics and environment in human health.
