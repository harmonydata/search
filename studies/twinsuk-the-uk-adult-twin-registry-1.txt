Initially focused on osteoporosis, the registry has grown to include over 15,000 twins, both monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (non-identical), ranging in age from 18 to 100. The study collects extensive phenotypic and genotypic data, allowing researchers to explore a wide array of health conditions, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and musculoskeletal diseases, as well as aging and microbiome studies. TwinsUK has contributed significantly to understanding the heritability of various traits and diseases, providing insights into the interplay between genetics and environment in human health. The registry's data have been instrumental in numerous genetic and epidemiological studies, enhancing knowledge about disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.","study_design":["twin","registry"],"end_year":null,"instruments":[],"name":"TwinsUK - The UK Adult Twin Registry","geographic_coverage":"England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland / Nationwide","num_variables":null,"urls":["https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=TWINSUK","https://twinsuk.ac.uk/)"],"start_year":1992,"sample_size":15732,"uuid":"d15c73cfd8892c5e7afcd714392f8081","number_of_variables":1601},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"child_datasets":[{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Family structure","description":"Provides the  zigosity of each participant as well as the relatedness between each them (family structure).","url":["https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=TWINSUK"],"keywords":["Covid-19 data collection","Biomarkers","Cognitive measures","Diet and nutrition","Sexuality and gender identity","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Language and literacy","Loneliness and social isolation","Migration and immigration","Neighbourhood","Physical health assessment","Political and social attitudes","Digital technology and social media","Victimisation and life events","Reproductive health","Work and employment","Sleep problems"],"identifier":[],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration: UK LLC","url":"https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk","image":"https://ukllc.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/ukllc-theme/assets/images/UKLLC_Logo_Landscape_Black.svg"}],"temporalCoverage":"1992/..","size":"15435","number_of_variables":4},"extra_data":{"country_codes":["GB"],"resource_type":"dataset","keywords":["Covid-19 data collection","Biomarkers","Cognitive measures","Diet and nutrition","Sexuality and gender identity","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Language and literacy","Loneliness and social isolation","Migration and immigration","Neighbourhood","Physical health assessment","Political and social attitudes","Digital technology and social media","Victimisation and life events","Reproductive health","Work and employment","Sleep problems"],"study_design":["longitudinal"],"source":["ukllc"],"slug":"family-structure","name":"Family structure"},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]},{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Serum metabolomics 1994- 2014","description":"Raw metabolomics data for serum sample collected for up to 3 time-points.
