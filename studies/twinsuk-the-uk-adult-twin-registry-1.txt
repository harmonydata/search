The study collects extensive phenotypic and genotypic data, allowing researchers to explore a wide array of health conditions, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and musculoskeletal diseases, as well as aging and microbiome studies. TwinsUK has contributed significantly to understanding the heritability of various traits and diseases, providing insights into the interplay between genetics and environment in human health. The registry's data have been instrumental in numerous genetic and epidemiological studies, enhancing knowledge about disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.","data_access":null,"resource_type":"study","harmony_id":"ukllc/twinsuk","end_year":null,"genetic_data_collected":false,"urls":["https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=TWINSUK","https://twinsuk.ac.uk/)"],"dois":[],"start_year":1992,"uuid":"d15c73cfd8892c5e7afcd714392f8081","number_of_variables":1601},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"child_datasets":[{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Serum metabolomics 1994- 2014","description":"Raw metabolomics data for serum sample collected for up to 3 time-points.
