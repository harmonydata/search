Initially focused on osteoporosis, the registry has grown to include over 15,000 twins, both monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (non-identical), ranging in age from 18 to 100. The study collects extensive phenotypic and genotypic data, allowing researchers to explore a wide array of health conditions, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and musculoskeletal diseases, as well as aging and microbiome studies. TwinsUK has contributed significantly to understanding the heritability of various traits and diseases, providing insights into the interplay between genetics and environment in human health. The registry's data have been instrumental in numerous genetic and epidemiological studies, enhancing knowledge about disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.","sample_size":15732,"name":"TwinsUK - The UK Adult Twin Registry","num_variables":null,"country_codes":["GB","IE"],"dois":["https://doi.org/10.1017/thg.2019.65"],"genetic_data_collected":false,"geographic_coverage":"England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland / Nationwide","resource_type":"study","source":["mhc","ukllc"],"start_year":1992,"language_codes":["en"],"instruments":[],"slug":"twinsuk-the-uk-adult-twin-registry","data_access":null,"end_year":null,"harmony_id":"ukllc/twinsuk","uuid":"d15c73cfd8892c5e7afcd714392f8081","number_of_variables":1601},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"child_datasets":[{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Covid-19 antibody response","description":"This dataset shows the participants' antibody response to natural infection, which is one way of measuring the main exposure.","url":["https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk/?source=TWINSUK"],"keywords":["Reproductive health","Biomarkers","Diet and nutrition","Cognitive measures","Neighbourhood","Victimisation and life events","Migration and immigration","Sleep problems","Sexuality and gender identity","Loneliness and social isolation","Work and employment","Digital technology and social media","Covid-19 data collection","Physical health assessment","Political and social attitudes","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Language and literacy"],"identifier":[],"includedInDataCatalog":[{"@type":"DataCatalog","name":"UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration: UK LLC","url":"https://explore.ukllc.ac.uk","image":"https://ukllc.ac.uk/wp-content/themes/ukllc-theme/assets/images/UKLLC_Logo_Landscape_Black.svg"}],"temporalCoverage":"21-04/22-01","size":"4753","number_of_variables":9},"extra_data":{"source":["ukllc"],"study_design":["longitudinal"],"resource_type":"dataset","name":"Covid-19 antibody response","country_codes":["GB"],"slug":"covid-19-antibody-response","keywords":["Reproductive health","Biomarkers","Diet and nutrition","Cognitive measures","Neighbourhood","Victimisation and life events","Migration and immigration","Sleep problems","Sexuality and gender identity","Loneliness and social isolation","Work and employment","Digital technology and social media","Covid-19 data collection","Physical health assessment","Political and social attitudes","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Language and literacy"]},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[]},{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Serum metabolomics 1994- 2014","description":"Raw metabolomics data for serum sample collected for up to 3 time-points.
