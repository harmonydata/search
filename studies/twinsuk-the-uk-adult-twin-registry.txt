The registry collects extensive phenotypic and genotypic data, allowing researchers to explore a wide array of health issues, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and aging. TwinsUK has contributed significantly to understanding the heritability of various traits and diseases, providing insights into the interplay between genetics and environment. The recent approval to include twin children will enable longitudinal studies across the entire lifespan, enhancing the potential for discoveries in health and disease progression.","sex":"all","geographic_coverage":"England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland","resource_type":"study","sample_size":16000,"end_year":null,"uuid":"4a6337663b674a30bb0c859941ed2976","number_of_variables":175},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"variables_which_matched":"$undefined"},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":false}]}]]
