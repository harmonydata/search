Established between 2006 and 2010, the study recruited 500,000 volunteers aged 40-69 years from across the United Kingdom. Participants provided detailed health and lifestyle information, physical measures, and biological samples (blood, urine, and saliva). The UK Biobank aims to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of a wide range of serious and life-threatening illnesses, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, eye disorders, depression, and various forms of dementia. The data collected is linked to participants' electronic health records, allowing researchers to study the impact of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors on health outcomes. The UK Biobank is a valuable resource for researchers worldwide, facilitating numerous studies that contribute to the understanding of complex diseases and the development of new medical treatments.c:[["$","$L14",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$15"}}],["$","$5",null,{"fallback":["$","div",null,{"children":"Loading..."}],"children":["$","$L16",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"UK Biobank","description":"The UK Biobank is a community-based cohort study comprised of 500,000 volunteers aged between 40-69 years in 2006-2010 from across the United Kingdom.
