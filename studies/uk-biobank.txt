It consists of a community-based cohort study of 500,000 volunteers aged between 40-69 years, recruited from across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010. Participants provided detailed information about their lifestyle, environment, and medical history, and underwent physical measures. Biological samples, including blood, urine, and saliva, were collected for future analysis. The study is designed to follow participants' health over time, linking to their health records to track the development of diseases. The UK Biobank's comprehensive dataset is used by researchers worldwide to study the genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that contribute to diseases such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, eye disorders, depression, and dementia. The resource is significant for its scale, depth, and the breadth of data available, making it a valuable tool for advancing medical research and public health.a:[["$","$L12",null,{"strategy":"beforeInteractive","id":"structured-data","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$13"}}],["$","$L14",null,{"study":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"UK Biobank","description":"A community-based cohort study comprised of 500,000 volunteers aged between 40-69 years in 2006-2010 from across the United Kingdom.
