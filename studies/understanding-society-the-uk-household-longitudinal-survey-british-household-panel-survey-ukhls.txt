A further 8,000 households from the British Household Panel Survey (see below) were invited to join at wave 2.

An additional 1,500 UK households are interviewed for the Innovation Panel, a separate annual survey which is used by researchers as a test bed for new ways of collecting data or exploring new topics before they become part of the main survey.

UKHLS also has an ethnicity strand, with boost samples to ensure the study had at least 1,000 adults from the five main ethnicity groups in the UK.

The Understanding Society: Longitudinal Teaching Dataset, Waves 1-9, 2009-2018 is a teaching resource using data from Understanding Society, the UK Household Longitudinal Study, which interviews individuals in the sampled households every year. There are two target audiences – 1) lecturers who would like to use the data file provided for longitudinal methods teaching purposes, and 2) data users who are new to using longitudinal data and can get a better understanding of using longitudinal data by using the supplied analysis guidance which utilizes the data file.
The statistical software used to construct the dataset is Stata and the analysis guidance provided is accompanied by Stata syntax only. The datafile is also available to download in SPSS and tab-delimited text formats. The User Guide includes guidance on how to convert the datafile in Stata format to R.
A second teaching resource using the Understanding Society survey is also available, see SN 8465, Understanding Society: Ethnicity and Health Teaching Dataset.
For information on the main Understanding Society study, see SN 6614, Understanding Society and Harmonised BHPS.

This study covers topics such as socio-demographic characteristics, education and labour market information, residential information, income, health and wellbeing, political behaviour and opinions, environmental attitudes and behaviours.17:T92d,Understanding Society (the UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, and the survey research organisations Verian Group (formerly Kantar Public) and NatCen.

The Understanding Society COVID-19 Study is a regular survey of households in the UK. The aim of the study is to enable research on the socio-economic and health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the short and long term. The surveys started in April 2020 and took place monthly until July 2020. From September they took place every other month until March 2021 and the final wave was fielded in September 2021. They complement the annual interviews of the
Understanding Society study.
A file is provided for each wave of the Understanding Society COVID-19 study to date, containing the Local Authority District geographic variable and a personal identification serial number (pidp) for file matching to the main Understanding Society COVID-19 study (SN 8644). There are two types of waves: web waves have a filename postfix of _w and telephone waves have a filename postfix of _t.
In addition, this study also contains Local Authority District geographic variables that can be matched to a dataset released with the main Understanding Society COVID-19 study containing data taken from waves 10 and 11 of the main Understanding Society survey, specifically for the respondents in the COVID-19 study. This file is named jk_oslaua_cv and as well as the LSOA11 geographic variable, it also contains a personal identification serial number (pidp) and a household identification serial number for both wave 10 (j_hidp) and wave 11 (k_hidp). Further details can be found in the Understanding Society COVID-19 User Guide.
Further information can be found on the Understanding Society COVID-19 website, including Data documentation. A list of Understanding Society COVID-19 Research Outputs (regularly updated) is also available.
New edition information

For the seventh edition (December 2021), the new data file for wave 9 has been deposited.
This dataset contains Local Authority District geographic variables for use with the Understanding Society COVID-19 study.18:T959,Understanding Society (UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, and the survey research organisations Verian Group and NatCen.

The Understanding Society: Linked Education Administrative Datasets (Scottish Education Data), Scotland, 2007-2018: Secure Access study contains six files extracted from Sottish Education Data held by the Scottish Government. These can be linked (within the Secure Access service) to Understanding Society participants using the cross-wave personal identifier (variable pidp). The Scottish Education Data files include information on pupil background, attainment, destination of leavers, student support, school attendance, absences and exclusions for all individuals with a valid consent to education linkage collected in Waves 1 and 4 of
Understanding Society. This includes consents collected from parents of children aged 4-15 and of the young adults aged 16-43 and born in 1981 or later. The files include School Pupil Census data collected in September from pupils in state schools. Attainment data relates to senior phase attainment covering SQA qualifications. See documentation for further details.
Related UK Data Archive studiesThe equivalent study to this one that covers England is available in SN 7642. This study is frequently linked through the pidp variable to one of the main Understanding Society datasets: SN 6614 (End User Licence), SN 6931 (Special Licence) or SN 6676 (Secure Access). A Special Licence dataset containing School Codes for the main Understanding Society study (SN 7182) is also available. Further details can be found on the

Understanding Society series webpage.
Topics covered in the data files include educational attainment scores, test/examination results, and school absences and exclusions, with a linking variable for matching with
Understanding Society data as noted in the Abstract section above. Individual school codes are included in the data. Demographic information such as ethnic groups, languages spoken at home, deprivation indices, eligibility for free school meals and special educational needs is included in the School Pupil Census file ('pupils_restricted'). See documentation for further details.19:Ta56,Understanding Society (the UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, and the survey research organisations Kantar Public and NatCen. It builds on and incorporates, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which began in 1991.

As multi-topic studies, the purpose of Understanding Society and BHPS is to understand short- and long-term effects of social and economic change in the UK at the household and individual levels. The study has a strong emphasis on domains of family and social ties, employment, education, financial resources, and health. 

Understanding Society is an annual survey of each adult member of a nationally representative sample. The same individuals are re-interviewed in each wave approximately 12 months apart. When individuals move they are followed within the UK and anyone joining their households are also interviewed as long as they are living with them.
The study has five sample components: the general population sample; a boost sample of ethnic minority group members; an immigrant and ethnic minority boost sample (from wave 6); participants from the BHPS; and the Innovation Panel (which is a separate standalone survey (see SN 6849 in the UKDS data catalogue). The fieldwork period is for 24 months.

Data collection uses computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) and web interviews (from wave 7), and includes a telephone mop up. From March 2020 (the end of wave 10 and 2nd year of wave 11), due to the coronavirus pandemic, face-to-face interviews were suspended and the survey has been conducted by web and telephone only, but otherwise has continued as before. One person completes the household questionnaire.

Each person aged 16 or older participates in the individual adult interview and self-completed questionnaire. Youths aged 10 to 15 are asked to respond to a paper self-completion questionnaire.

The version of Understanding Society held in the SRS is the Secure Access variant which in addition to containing the main Special Licence dataset (SN 6931 at the UKDS) also includes full date of birth details of survey members as well as grid reference geographical identifiers of households. Other geographical identifiers are also available on request.

Other datasets such as Biomarker data, summary genetics and epigenetic scores, partnership histories, linked administrative data, calendar year data, school codes, higher education codes, interviewer details, and a related COVID-19 study are available via the UKDS and further details can be found on their data catalogue.1a:T526,The Understanding Society: Interviewer Survey 2014 data file is the output of a research project that collected information from interviewers who worked on the Understanding Society data collection for Great Britain in the first round of interviews, which took place over the course of the years 2009 and 2010. 

One of the specific aims of the data collection was to better understand the nature of bias in respondent consent to data linkage and, in particular, the role of interviewers in obtaining consent and in affecting consent bias. Hence, the interviewer survey includes a number of questions eliciting interviewer attitudes to consent to data linkage and their experiences with asking for consent during the fieldwork. There are, however, also a great deal of questions that will be of interest to a greater audience of researchers, such as interviewer attitudes to persuasion, measures of their personality traits and markers of general trust.

 The dataset included the following topics:
interviewers' opinions on their jobattitudes to persuasion, surveys in generalpersonality traits and trustdata privacy and administration of Understanding Societyexperience asking for consent to link to administrative datausefulness of linked data and their own likelihood of consent to linked data in different domains1b:T462,We analysed the Understanding Society Data from Waves 1 and 2 in our project to explore the uses of paradata in cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys with the aim of gaining knowledge that leads to improvement in field process management and responsive survey designs.  The project’s key objective was to explore the uses of paradata for cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys with the aim of gaining knowledge that leads to improvement in field process management and responsive survey designs.
The research was organised into three sub-projects which:
1. investigate the use of call record data and interviewer observations to study nonresponse in longitudinal surveys;
 2. provide insights into the effects of interviewing strategies and other interviewer attributes on response in longitudinal surveys, and
 3. gain knowledge about the measurement error properties of paradata, in particular interviewer observations.
    Analysis techniques included multilevel, discrete-time event history and longitudinal data analysis methods. Dissemination included a short course and an international workshop on paradata.1c:T7f8,The aim of this project was to make easier-to-handle teaching datasets from Understanding Society, building a core of common variables from the first three waves but including some other wave-specific information from each wave. The richness of the data, including the combination of ratio/interval data as well as categorical/ordinal data, makes for an effective dataset from which to teach quantitative methods of all kinds. A distinctive feature is the provision of datasets in native R format in addition to those in a statistical format. The documentation for the 'parent' Understanding Society dataset (SN 6614 at the UK Data Service) is the definitive guide to the variables, sampling, etc.

The dataset was compiled under the ESRC-funded Understanding Society Through Secondary Data Analysis: Quantitative Methods over the Undergraduate Life Course award. This project aimed to enhance the capacity of social science undergraduates to understand and use numeric data in their studies, by generating teaching-ready datasets based on Understanding Society. It also aimed to create associated digital resources that will be available for other students to use; to increase the amount of work using secondary data at the undergraduate level and to underline the relevance of research methods to the study of social sciences. As part of the award, a programme of new courses was planned, taking undergraduate students from their first year through to their final year. This new approach aimed to provide a solid foundation for employability and future careers using quantitative skills (whether in the public sector, in academia, or elsewhere). 

 Extraction of data from main Understanding Society study, including sex, age, residential history, country of birth, citizenship, ethnicity, languages spoken, religion, marital history, families, health, employment, environmental conservation habits, income, political affiliation and awareness, education, responsibilities for household tasks, television viewing and newspaper readership.1d:Tf08,The Commuting and Wellbeing study involved an analysis of the first six waves of data released from Understanding Society (the UK Household Longitudinal Study). 
The Commuting and Wellbeing study addressed three research questions: 1. What specific aspects of wellbeing (e.g. satisfaction with leisure time, feeling constantly under strain) are related to commuting and how do personal and spatial characteristics affect this?; 2. How do different commuting behaviours influence the development of wellbeing over time?; and 3. How do changes in life situation (e.g. moving home, changing jobs) and commuting behaviours influence personal wellbeing over time?
The proposed study will generate novel understanding of the process by which commuting behaviours influence personal wellbeing over time. There is growing recognition that traditional measures of economic growth (like GDP) do not necessarily imply improving quality of life across the population. In acknowledgement of this, the UK government has committed to improving their understanding of personal 'wellbeing'. In general terms, wellbeing refers to the extent to which people's lives are going well and this can be affected by lifestyle practices that may influence physical or mental health. Given that commuting is a regularly repeated activity for the working population, it has been suggested that certain travel behaviours, such as long commutes or cycling regularly, could worsen or improve an individual's health and wellbeing over time. However, good evidence is lacking to confirm this. 
The study will make use of the Understanding Society study, a unique data resource that has been tracking the lives of members of 40,000 households since 2009/10. The same participants have been surveyed once every year, making it possible to understand how and why their lives are changing over time. The proposed study will analyse the first six waves of Understanding Society data. The analysis will identify how the commuting behaviours of employed adults have changed over the period and establish whether and how commuting has affected different aspects of their personal wellbeing. The longitudinal data will allow analysis which considers whether effect takes place after cause and whether greater exposure leads to larger effect. These criteria for causation have not been tested previously. For instance the study will examine if individuals with longer commute times suffer from higher stress levels and reduced leisure time and consequently report lower personal wellbeing overall. By comparison, do those that start walking to work feel that their physical health improves and stress levels reduce, and hence report better wellbeing overall? The study will seek to address such questions. 
The proposed research has been co-designed by a research team from the University of the West of England (UWE) and policy researchers at the Department for Transport (DfT). DfT has identified specific evidence needs relating to commuting and wellbeing. The research team comprises travel behaviour experts and statisticians from UWE, a health economist from Rand Europe (Adam Martin), and Dr Adrian Davis, an expert in the relationship between transport and health. DfT will chair a project steering group and be joined as project partner by Department of Health and What Works Centre for Wellbeing. A stakeholder interest group will also ensure close links with policy and practice over the course of the study, Outputs from the project will include policy briefing notes and policy toolkit, co-produced by the project partners and the team of researchers. This will showcase new evidence on the relationships between commuting and wellbeing and be used in practice to identify policies and interventions to improve wellbeing through 'healthy commuting' across the working population.1e:T9d4,Understanding Society, (UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex and the survey research organisations Verian Group (formerly Kantar Public) and NatCen.

The Understanding Society COVID-19 Study, 2020-2021 is a regular survey of households in the UK. The aim of the study is to enable research on the socio-economic and health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the short and long term. The surveys started in April 2020 and took place monthly until July 2020. From September 2020 they took place every other month until March 2021 and the final wave was fielded in September 2021. They complement the annual interviews of the Understanding Society study. The data can be linked to data on the same individuals from previous waves of the annual interviews (SN 6614) using the personal identifier pidp. However, the most recent pre-pandemic (2019) annual interviews for all respondents who have taken part in the COVID-19 Study are included as part of this data release.

Latest edition information



For the eleventh edition (December 2021), revised April, May, June, July, September, November 2020, January 2021 and March 2021 data files for the adult survey have been deposited. These files have been amended to address issues identified during ongoing quality assurance activities. All documentation has been updated to explain the revisions, and users are advised to consult the documentation for details. In addition new data from the September 2021 web survey have been deposited.


The survey contains information about mental and physical health, health behaviours, caring, housing, employment, job search, income, education, family relationships, return to school and children’s strength and difficulties questionnaire, young adults’ future intentions. The survey also includes data on COVID-19 antibodies analysed from blood samples.1f:T415,This is a qualitative data collection. This project explored how shared care is understood, negotiated and practised by separated families, to assess the appropriateness of existing questions in Understanding Society in capturing the phenomenon, and to suggest changes where appropriate. This data consists of the transcripts of 31 semi-structured interviews of separated parents sampled from the longitudinal dataset Understanding Society: 13 men and 18 women. Included are interviews from 7 formerly partnered couples (14 interviews in total). Separated parents with at least one child under 16, who reported at least weekly contact between their children and the non-resident parent in the Understanding Society dataset were eligible for interview, and a random subset of these were invited to participate. Interviews were conducted from across the UK and with parents with varying current partnerships statuses, number and age of children, and employment statuses.

The Understanding Society Spending Study 2 was conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex. The purpose of the study was to test ways to increase participation in mobile data collection. The study comprised two separate sample groups: adult sample members of the Understanding Society Innovation Panel (see SN 6849) and members of the Lightspeed UK Online Access Panel. Respondents in both sample groups were invited to download an app on their smartphone to provide daily updates on their spending for 31 days. Those who did not download the app were invited to complete a daily browser-based online diary. Data for the Innovation Panel sample were collected between May 2018 and February 2019. Data for the Lightspeed UK Online Access Panel sample were collected between July 2018 and January 2019.Further information about the Spending Study, including links to publications and documents, can be found on the ISER Understanding household finance through better measurement webpage.

The Harmonized Histories is an international comparative dataset, created through harmonising data from existing surveys into one common format. The aim of
Harmonized Histories is to facilitate cross-national research on topics related to transition to adulthood, family formation, and childbearing. The dataset focuses on fertility and partnership histories but also captures information on socio-economic status, place of residence and information on the childhood family. You can find more information about
Harmonized Histories and access to the datasets from other countries via the Generations & Gender Programme (GGP) website.





Two datasets are provided. The first includes all people aged 16 or over who participated in the full interview of Wave 1 of the
Understanding Society project and the data as is collected at Wave 1. The second dataset follows the people who are in the first dataset prospectively. Thus, it includes all the retrospective information from the first dataset and has been updated when things changed, for instance the partners got married or had children. For more information please refer to the User Guide.

Harmonized Histories uses
Understanding Society for data on the UK. As Harmonized Histories is a cross-national project, please note that the variable naming conventions and terminology used in this dataset are different to the standard
Understanding Society naming and terms.

The Understanding Society: Linked Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) Dataset, 2013-2015 study contains vehicle data extracted from the
Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) for vehicles that Understanding Society
respondents have specifically identified as having access to: 32 key variables for each vehicle are included. Vehicle statistics contain but are not limited to: brand name, year of manufacture, year of first registration, price band, engine size, vehicle mass, CO2 emissions, and fuel type. 
This dataset can be linked through the household identifier variable (hidp) to one of the main
Understanding Society datasets: SN 6614 (End User Licence), SN 6931 (Special Licence) or SN 6676 (Secure Access). See documentation for further details.Update July 2023:The user guide has been replaced with a new version.
Topics covered in the data files all relate to licensing details for vehicles. See documentation for further details.23:Td59,As the UK went into the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, the team behind the biggest social survey in the UK, Understanding Society (UKHLS), developed a way to capture these experiences. From April 2020, participants from this Study were asked to take part in the Understanding Society COVID-19 survey, henceforth referred to as the COVID-19 survey or the COVID-19 study.The COVID-19 survey regularly asked people about their situation and experiences. The resulting data gives a unique insight into the impact of the pandemic on individuals, families, and communities. The COVID-19 Teaching Dataset contains data from the main COVID-19 survey in a simplified form. It covers topics such as
Socio-demographics
Whether working at home and home-schooling
COVID symptoms
Health and well-being
Social contact and neighbourhood cohesion
Volunteering
The resource contains two data files:
Cross-sectional: contains data collected in Wave 4 in July 2020 (with some additional variables from other waves);
Longitudinal: Contains mainly data from Waves 1, 4 and 9 with key variables measured at three time points.
Key features of the dataset
Missing values: in the web survey, participants clicking "Next" but not answering a question were given further options such as "Don't know" and "Prefer not to say". Missing observations like these are recorded using negative values such as -1 for "Don't know". In many instances, users of the data will need to set these values as missing. The User Guide includes Stata and SPSS code for setting negative missing values to system missing.

The Longitudinal file is a balanced panel and is in wide format. A balanced panel means it only includes participants that took part in every wave. In wide format, each participant has one row of information, and each measurement of the same variable is a different variable.

Weights: both the cross-sectional and longitudinal files include survey weights that adjust the sample to represent the UK adult population. The cross-sectional weight (betaindin_xw) adjusts for unequal selection probabilities in the sample design and for non-response. The longitudinal weight (ci_betaindin_lw) adjusts for the sample design and also for the fact that not all those invited to participate in the survey, do participate in all waves.

Both the cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets include the survey design variables (psu and strata).
A full list of variables in both files can be found in the User Guide appendix.Who is in the sample?All adults (16 years old and over as of April 2020), in households who had participated in at least one of the last two waves of the main study Understanding Society, were invited to participate in this survey. From the September 2020 (Wave 5) survey onwards, only sample members who had completed at least one partial interview in any of the first four web surveys were invited to participate. From the November 2020 (Wave 6) survey onwards, those who had only completed the initial survey in April 2020 and none since, were no longer invited to participate

The Understanding Society Innovation Panel Life Events Study, 2020, was a monthly survey of households from the Innovation Panel sample. The aim of the study was to test methods for collecting data about life events (such as new health conditions, pregnancy, job changes, residential moves, and partnership changes) close in time to when the events occur. The survey asked about the occurrence of events, details of the events, and implications for wellbeing, mental health, finances, and support networks. The survey started in February 2020 and was fielded monthly until January 2021. The recall period for each survey was the previous calendar month, that is, the survey collected data about life events from January to December 2020. Innovation Panel sample members in households that regularly used the internet were invited to a monthly web survey. The data can be linked to data on the same individuals from previous and future waves of the annual Innovation Panel interviews (SN

The Wellbeing app study was conducted in 2020 as part of the annual Innovation Panel (IP) Wave 13 interview. All adult respondents who had completed at least one previous IP interview were invited to download an app onto their smartphone or tablet. They were asked to use the app every evening for 14 days to report on their emotional state and self-regulation, external stressors, attachment, and interactions with loved ones. Participants were incentivised throughout the fieldwork period, with incentives being paid at the end of their two-week participation period. Of the 2,152 respondents who were invited to the app study, 967 completed the daily app questionnaire at least once. The Wellbeing app data were collected between 14 July and 26 November 2020. The protocols for the mobile app data collection included three experiments: i) varying the value of incentives for completing the study, ii) varying the length of the daily questionnaire, and iii) varying the placement of the invitation to the app study within the annual IP interview. The data deposited for the Wellbeing App Study include the survey and paradata collected with the app. The data can be linked to data on the same individuals from previous and future waves of the annual IP interviews (SN

The project made extensive use of secondary household panel survey data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS, 1991-2008) and its successor, Understanding Society (UKHLS, 2009-present).

This collection consists of project R code written to (1) extract and then (2) combine data from across the various files of BHPS and UKHLS into one ‘master’ longitudinal dataset containing annual records for all observed individuals from 1991 to 2020. A number of key individual and household-level variables (including age, sex, country of birth, partnership status, highest educational qualification, employment status, incomes and region) are then (3) cleaned and harmonised. 

Users can download and adapt the deposited code as needed for their own social science applications.The Modelling Housing Career Trajectories in Great Britain project aimed to develop our understanding of how people's pathways through the housing market are changing in 21st Century Britain. To do this, one strand of empirical research used UK household panel survey data (the British Household Panel Survey and its successor, Understanding Society) to examine housing career pathways and homeownership transitions since the 1990s. 

This collection contains R code written to (1) extract BHPS and Understanding Society data, (2) combine various data files from the two collections and (3) produce a basic set of harmonised BHSP-Understanding Society variables to support longitudinal analysis covering the 1991-present period. Users can download and adapt the code for their own research projects.27:T4b4,This paper that supplements the code available in this collection examines UK immigrant-native wage differentials for men across major first- and second-generation immigrant groups with the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) pooling cross-sections over the years 2009–2019. I find that first-generation immigrants with UK human capital experience less of a wage disadvantage than their immigrant counterparts with foreign language proficiency, qualifications, and work experience. Conditional on the heterogeneity in these productivity characteristics of first-generation immigrants, I observe no intergenerational economic progress across the two generations relative to UK natives. Using a conditional decomposition shows that UK work experience and not the source country of study for the qualification is a key factor in reducing first-generation, immigrant-native wage differentials in the UK.Current literature reports large first-generation immigrant-native wage differentials in the UK. The aim of this research is to show that some if by no means all of the wage differentials can be explained by human capital factors, i.e., by the source of qualification, work experience, and language.28:Ta9a,Understanding Society (the UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, and the survey research organisations Verian Group (formerly Kantar Public) and NatCen.

The Understanding Society: UKMOD Input Data, 2010-2019: Special Licence Access dataset provides input data for the longitudinal version of the UKMOD microsimulation model. The longitudinal version of UKMOD runs on Understanding Society data and covers the period 2010-2019 (Waves 1-11). The UKHLS is a large panel survey with a sample of approximately 40,000 households in its first wave. It contains detailed income data and a wide range of demographic and labour market information. As such it is the primary survey of interest in the UK for those interested in longitudinal analysis.
UKMOD is a tax-benefit microsimulation model (MSM) for the UK and its constituent nations (England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland) that originated from EUROMOD. Since 2020 UK MOD has replaced, as a stand-alone model, the UK component of EUROMOD. UKMOD is freely accessible, released open-source, and thoroughly documented and validated using external data. The standard cross-sectional version of UKMOD uses the Family Resources Survey (FRS) as its input dataset.
A tax-benefit microsimulation model is a computer code that calculates disposable income for each micro-unit (such as individual or household) in a representative sample of the population, under a specific policy scenario. Based on micro-level information about the individual and household characteristics and on legislative rules, UKMOD simulates the amount of fiscal liabilities and benefit entitlements at the tax-benefit unit level.
Tax-benefit microsimulation models are used to answer "what if" questions about the effects of tax and benefit reforms on household incomes and the income distribution. Such analysis is regularly performed for Budget and other Government policy announcements, and is also highly relevant for the design of alternative reforms and new policy instruments taking account of the diverse economic circumstances of the UK population. The longitudinal version of the data allows researchers to address additional questions, for example about the evolution of outcomes of interest over time. It also allows UKMOD outputs to be linked with additional information not used by the tax and benefit model but present in the UKHLS data for example, about labour market activity, retirement, health and wellbeing and others.SN 9147 can be used on its own with UKMOD and is sufficient to conduct typical UKMOD analysis. For applicants seeking to add additional Understanding Society variables not included in the UKMOD dataset SN 9147, accessing SN 6614 (Safeguarded / EUL) and linking it to dataset SN 9147 normally provides a sufficient level of detail. However, in some instances, the desired variables may only be available in the safeguarded / Special Licence equivalent, SN 6931. Full details of how to link the datasets are provided in the User Guide.

The Understanding Society: Waves 7-8, 2015-2016: Special Licence Access, EU Referendum dataset was constructed in order to provide researchers early access to a question asked in Wave 8 on whether the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union. The dataset in this release was constructed from the first year’s respondents of Wave 8. It was not subjected to the full processing that a full Wave receives and not all data files were released. As a consequence the data was only supplied directly by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) to researchers who submitted approved research proposals utilising the EU Referendum question. As Wave 7 had also not been released at the time the corresponding Wave 7 data was also supplied. It is this Wave 7 and Wave 8 data that forms this release.
These data have more restrictive access conditions than those available under the standard End User Licence (see 'Access' section). This dataset will only be supplied for verification of research conducted using the early access data that was supplied directly by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) for approved research utilising the EU Referendum question. Users wishing to utilise the question for future research can access it in Wave 8 of the standard Understanding Society dataset (SN 6614). Those users who wish to make an application for these data should contact the Help Desk for further details. Understanding Society data are included from the first four quarters of wave 7 and wave 8 fieldwork, i.e. households that were issued for fieldwork from January 2016 up to and including December 2016. Some respondents will have completed their interviews in 2017 despite being issued to fieldwork in 2016. The files included are:

The Understanding Society: Waves 1-2, 2009-2011: Special Licence Access, Geographical Accessibility (UKHLS-accessibility) dataset is the output of a research project that linked information from the Department for Transport's (DfT) Accessibility Statistics with information from the first two waves of Understanding Society. It provides user-friendly access to information about the areas in which study members live, taken from more than 20 published tables describing small areas (Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) levels in England in terms of more than 600 unique data items relating to access to eight domains of public service (i.e., Employment Centres, Primary Schools, Secondary Schools, Further Education, General Practitioners, Hospitals, Food Stores, and Town Centres). For further information, see the documentation.  This work was supported by the  Life Transitions and Transport Behaviour project of the Economic and Social Research Council's  Secondary Data Analysis Initiative (SDAI) programme (grant number: ES/K00445X/1), a collaboration between the University of the West of England, the Department for Transport and the Institute for Social and Economic Research.

From Wave 1 onwards participants were asked a number of questions about their general health. In Wave 2 and Wave 3 adult participants received a follow-up health assessment visit from a registered nurse.
A range of bio-medical measures were collected from around 20000 adults, which included blood pressure, weight, height, waist measurement, body fat, grip strength and lung function. Blood samples were also taken at these visits and frozen for future research. A number of biomarkers have now been extracted from the blood which measure major illnesses in the UK as well as being markers of key physiological systems.  A genome wide scan has been conducted on DNA samples from approximately 10000 people, which enables us to examine gene-environment interactions for health and social phenomena. Methylation profiling has been conducted on DNA samples from approximately 1200 individuals from the British Household Panel Survey component of Understanding Society. This is particular important to advance understanding of how people’s social, economic and physical environments over their life time influence their biological processes by altering how their genes work.

The annual information across a wide range of topics gathered as part of Understanding Society before and after childbirth, coupled with data on the entire family, provides contextual insight into the development of children. Moreover, all children in the household are themselves participants of Understanding Society from birth, parents provide information on their child’s health and development until the age of 10, when data is gathered directly from all children.
The Pregnancy and Early Childhood (PEACH) dataset consists of a single crosswave file that brings together the key data reported by parents for all children aged under 10 years as reported in the w_child file, w_newborn file and information on pregnancy and parenting styles from w_indresp files across waves 1 to 13 of the main study. The information is provided at the child level using the child's identifier (crosswave person identifier - pidp) to ensure each row is uniquely identifiable. In addition, the pidp of the parent or responsible adult providing information at different waves is included to make it easy to link back to family circumstances. A total of 303 variables are included, created from 164 questions. Full details can be found in the user guide.
This dataset is designed to be linked to the main Understanding Society datasets SN 6614 (end user licence), SN 6931 (special licence) or SN 6676 (secure access), so that the child’s development can be related to their broader family circumstances.

For details of the main Understanding Society study, please see study number 6614.Innovation PanelThe Innovation Panel is designed for experimental and methodological research relevant to longitudinal surveys. As far as practical its design, content, and data collection procedures are similar to the main stage Understanding Society survey. It is a multi-topic household survey representative of the population of Great Britain. Data collection takes place annually using computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), web surveys and telephone interviewing (CATI) to a small extent. One person completes the household questionnaire. Each person aged 16 or older answers the individual adult interview, including and self-completion questionnaire. Young people aged 10 to 15 years are asked to respond to a paper self-completion questionnaire. The Innovation Panel has multiple experimental studies in which households or individuals are randomly assigned to a particular instrument or survey procedure. Experiments can relate to survey procedures, questionnaire design, or substantive social science questions. The experiments are described in the User Manual and in Understanding Society Working Papers. Wave 12 included an experiment involving the collection of biomeasures by nurses, interviewers and respondents themselves. The biomeasures included in the experiment were: height, weight, blood pressure, venous and dried blood samples and hair samples. Biomarkers have been derived from the different blood and hair samples to compare analytes across sample types. Due to COVID-19 Waves 13 and 14 were implemented using computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) and web surveys. Wave 15 included additional data on body measurements. Respondents were asked to install the BodyVolume app on their smartphone or tablet (iOS or Android) and use it after the interview to take two photos of themselves. The app used the body outlines along with profile information that the respondent entered in the app (age, sex, height, weight, level of activity) to calculate measures including waist and hip circumference, total body fat, visceral body fat, and lengths of different body parts. Wave 16 included an experiment asking parents of children aged under 16 to supply health related information from the child’s red book. Respondents were also asked to install the Sea Hero Quest app and play a game that measures spatial cognition.Secure Access Dataset:The Understanding Society: Innovation Panel, Waves 1-16, 2008-2023 dataset contains British National Grid postcode grid references (at 1m resolution) for each household surveyed, derived from the ONS National Statistics Postcode Directories (NSPD). Grid references are presented in terms of Eastings and Northings, which are distances in metres (east and north, respectively) from the origin (0,0), which lies to the west of the Scilly Isles. Each grid reference is given a positional quality indicator to denote the accuracy of the grid reference. In the majority of cases, the assigned grid reference relates to the building of the matched address closest to the postcode mean. No grid references are provided for postcodes in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.The Secure Access version of Understanding Society: Innovation Panel 2008-2023 includes all files in the Special Licence version, plus files containing the 3 variables relating to the National Grid Reference for each household: Easting, Northing and positional quality indicator (OSGRDIND). All other files are the same as in the Special Licence version, which is held under SN 7083.Related UK Data Archive studies:The Secure Access version of the dataset has more restrictive access conditions than standard End User Licence or Special Licence access datasets (see 'Access' section). Further details and links to the less restrictive versions can be found on the Understanding Society series Key data page.Latest edition informationFor the 11th edition (November 2024), Wave 16 has been deposited with accompanying documentation. All previous waves have also been redeposited with various corrections - see '7332_ip_waves_1-15_changes_collated.pdf' for details of the changes.Co-fundersIn addition to the Economic and Social Research Council, co-funders for the study included the Department of Work and Pensions, the Department for Education, the Department for Transport, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, the Department for Community and Local Government, the Department of Health, the Scottish Government, the Welsh Assembly Government, the Northern Ireland Executive, the Department of Environment and Rural Affairs, and the Food Standards Agency.
The survey instrument is constructed using modules. For a fuller listing of modules and questionnaire content see the ISER Innovation Panel Dataset Documentation webpage. Experiments are described in the User Manual for the Innovation Panel.
The household questionnaire includes a composition listing of all household members and collects information about gender, date of birth, marital and employment status, and relationship to the household respondent. The household questionnaire also has questions about housing, mortgage or rent payments, material deprivation, and consumer durables and cars. The individual interview is asked of every person in the household aged 16 or over, and covers: demographics, baseline information, family background, ethnicity and national identity; religion; partnership and fertility histories; health, disability and caring; current employment and earnings; parenting and childcare arrangements; contact with non-resident children; benefit payments; and household finances. A proxy module, a much shortened version of the individual questionnaire, collects demographic, health, and employment information, as well as a summary income measure.
The adult self-completion questionnaire was a pencil-and-paper instrument (PAPI) at Waves 1 and 3, and in Waves 4-7 included an experimental comparison with Computer Assisted Self-Completion (CASI). It includes subjective questions, particularly those which are potentially sensitive or require more privacy. It covers feelings of depression, sleep behaviour, neighbourhood participation and belonging, life satisfaction, and attributes of friends. There was no adult self-completion questionnaire at Wave 2.

Innovation Panel

The Innovation Panel is designed for experimental and methodological research relevant to longitudinal surveys. As far as practical its design, content, and data collection procedures are similar to the main stage Understanding Society survey. It is a multi-topic household survey representative of the population of Great Britain. Data collection takes place annually using computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), web surveys and telephone interviewing (CATI) to a small extent. One person completes the household questionnaire. Each person aged 16 or older answers the individual adult interview, including and self-completion questionnaire. Young people aged 10 to 15 years are asked to respond to a paper self-completion questionnaire. The Innovation Panel has multiple experimental studies in which households or individuals are randomly assigned to a particular instrument or survey procedure. Experiments can relate to survey procedures, questionnaire design, or substantive social science questions. The experiments are described in the User Manual and in Understanding Society Working Papers. Wave 12 included an experiment involving the collection of biomeasures by nurses, interviewers and respondents themselves. The biomeasures included in the experiment were: height, weight, blood pressure, venous and dried blood samples and hair samples. Biomarkers have been derived from the different blood and hair samples to compare analytes across sample types. Due to COVID-19 Waves 13 and 14 were implemented using computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) and web surveys. Wave 15 included additional data on body measurements. Respondents were asked to install the BodyVolume app on their smartphone or tablet (iOS or Android) and use it after the interview to take two photos of themselves. The app used the body outlines along with profile information that the respondent entered in the app (age, sex, height, weight, level of activity) to calculate measures including waist and hip circumference, total body fat, visceral body fat, and lengths of different body parts. Wave 16 included an experiment asking parents of children aged under 16 to supply health related information from the child’s red book. Respondents were also asked to install the Sea Hero Quest app and play a game that measures spatial cognition.
There are two primary versions of the Innovation Panel data. One is available under the standard End User Licence (EUL) agreement, and the other is a Special Licence (SL) version (available under SN 7083). The SL version contains month and year of birth variables in addition to age, county variables, more detailed country and occupation coding for a number of variables; and various income variables have not been top-coded (see the documentation available with the SL version for more detail on the differences). In addition, there are a number of SL geographical datasets that are designed to be used in conjunction with the primary datasets. Low- and Medium-level geographical identifiers are also available subject to SL access conditions and fine detail geographic data are available under more restrictive Secure Access conditions that contains British National Grid postcode grid references (at 1m resolution) for the unit postcode of each household surveyed.

It builds on and incorporates, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which began in 1991.

This release combines fourteen waves of Understanding Society data with harmonised data from all eighteen waves of the BHPS. As multi-topic studies, the purpose of Understanding Society and BHPS is to understand short- and long-term effects of social and economic change in the UK at the household and individual levels. The study has a strong emphasis on domains of family and social ties, employment, education, financial resources, and health. Understanding Society is an annual survey of each adult member of a nationally representative sample. The same individuals are re-interviewed in each wave approximately 12 months apart. When individuals move they are followed within the UK and anyone joining their households are also interviewed as long as they are living with them. The study has five sample components: the general population sample; a boost sample of ethnic minority group members; an immigrant and ethnic minority boost sample (from wave 6); participants from the BHPS; and a second general population boost sample added at this wave. In addition, there is the Understanding Society Innovation Panel (which is a separate standalone survey (see SN 6849)). The fieldwork period is for 24 months. Data collection uses computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) and web interviews (from wave 7), and includes a telephone mop-up. From March 2020 (the end of wave 10 and the 2nd year of wave 11), due to the coronavirus pandemic, face-to-face interviews were suspended, and the survey was conducted by web and telephone only, but otherwise has continued as before. Face-to-face interviewing was resumed from April 2022. One person completes the household questionnaire. Each person aged 16 is invited to complete the individual adult interview and self-completed questionnaire. Parents are asked questions about their children under 10 years old. Youths aged 10 to 15 are asked to respond to a self-completion questionnaire. For the general and BHPS samples biomarker, genetic and epigenetic data are also available. The biomarker data, and summary genetics and epigenetic scores, are available via UKDS (see SN 7251); detailed genetics and epigenetics data are available by application (see below). In 2020-21 an additional frequent web survey was separately issued to sample members to capture data on the rapid changes in people’s lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic (see SN 8644). Participants are asked consent to link their data to wide-ranging administrative data sets (see below).

End User Licence, Special Licence and Secure Access versions:
There are three versions of the main Understanding Society data with different access conditions. One is available under the standard End User Licence (EUL) agreement (this study), one is a Special Licence (SL) version (SN 6931) and the third is a Secure Access version (SN 6676). The SL version contains month as well as year of birth variables, more detailed country and occupation coding for a number of variables, various income variables that have not been top-coded, and other potentially sensitive variables (see 6931_eul_vs_sl_variable_differences document available with the SL version for full details of the differences). The Secure Access version, in addition to containing all the variables in the SL version, also contains day of birth as well as Grid Reference geographical variables. Users are advised to first obtain the standard EUL version of the data to see if they are sufficient for their research requirements. The SL and Secure Access versions of the data have more restrictive access conditions and prospective users of those versions should visit the catalogue entries for SN 6931 and SN 6676 respectively for further information.43:T12ab,Understanding Society, (UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex and the survey research organisations Verian Group (formerly Kantar Public) and NatCen.

In addition, Wave 13 data has been re-deposited with superfluous entries removed.4c:T12a3,Understanding Society (the UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, and the survey research organisations Verian Group (formerly Kantar Public) and NatCen. It builds on and incorporates, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which began in 1991. 
This release combines fourteen waves of Understanding Society data with harmonised data from all eighteen waves of the BHPS. As multi-topic studies, the purpose of Understanding Society and BHPS is to understand short- and long-term effects of social and economic change in the UK at the household and individual levels. The study has a strong emphasis on domains of family and social ties, employment, education, financial resources, and health. Understanding Society is an annual survey of each adult member of a nationally representative sample. The same individuals are re-interviewed in each wave approximately 12 months apart. When individuals move they are followed within the UK and anyone joining their households are also interviewed as long as they are living with them. The study has five sample components: the general population sample; a boost sample of ethnic minority group members; an immigrant and ethnic minority boost sample (from wave 6); participants from the BHPS; and a second general population boost sample added at this wave. In addition, there is the Understanding Society Innovation Panel (which is a separate standalone survey (see SN 6849)). The fieldwork period is for 24 months. Data collection uses computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) and web interviews (from wave 7), and includes a telephone mop-up. From March 2020 (the end of wave 10 and the 2nd year of wave 11), due to the coronavirus pandemic, face-to-face interviews were suspended, and the survey was conducted by web and telephone only, but otherwise has continued as before. Face-to-face interviewing was resumed from April 2022. One person completes the household questionnaire. Each person aged 16 is invited to complete the individual adult interview and self-completed questionnaire. Parents are asked questions about their children under 10 years old. Youths aged 10 to 15 are asked to respond to a self-completion questionnaire. For the general and BHPS samples biomarker, genetic and epigenetic data are also available. The biomarker data, and summary genetics and epigenetic scores, are available via UKDS (see SN 7251); detailed genetics and epigenetics data are available by application (see below). In 2020-21 an additional frequent web survey was separately issued to sample members to capture data on the rapid changes in people’s lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic (see SN 8644). Participants are asked consent to link their data to wide-ranging administrative data sets (see below).

End User Licence, Special Licence and Secure Access versions:
There are three versions of the main Understanding Society data with different access conditions. One is available under the standard End User Licence (EUL) agreement (SN 6614), one is a Special Licence (SL) version (this study) and the third is a Secure Access version (SN 6676). The SL version contains month as well as year of birth variables, more detailed country and occupation coding for a number of variables, various income variables that have not been top-coded, and other potentially sensitive variables (see 6931_eul_vs_sl_variable_differences document available with the SL version for full details of the differences). The Secure Access version, in addition to containing all the variables in the SL version, also contains day of birth as well as Grid Reference geographical variables. Users are advised to first obtain the standard EUL version of the data to see if they are sufficient for their research requirements. The SL and Secure Access versions of the data have more restrictive access conditions and prospective users of those versions should visit the catalogue entries for SN 6931 and SN 6676 respectively for further information.4d:T67f,Understanding Society (the UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, and the survey research organisations Verian Group (formerly Kantar Public) and NatCen. It builds on and incorporates, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which began in 1991. 
This dataset contains Census 2001-defined geographic variables for each wave of Understanding Society and harmonised BHPS to date, and a household identification serial number for file matching to the main data. LSOA’s are provided for England and Wales households, Super Output Areas (SOA) are provided for Northern Ireland and Data Zones (DZ) are provided for Scotland.
These data have more restrictive access conditions than those available under the standard End User Licence (see 'Access data' tab for more information).
These data are consistent with the ONS Postcode Directory (ONSPD). Please see the Geographical Lookup Tables document for further details.

The Understanding Society: Waves 1-14, 2009-2023 and Harmonised BHPS: Waves 1-18, 1991-2009: Secure Access dataset contains British National Grid postcode grid references (at 1m resolution) for the unit postcode of each household surveyed, derived from the ONS National Statistics Postcode Directory (ONSPD). Grid references are presented in terms of Eastings and Northings, which are distances in metres (east and north, respectively) from the origin (0,0), which lies to the west of the Scilly Isles. Each grid reference is given a positional quality indicator to denote the accuracy of the grid reference. In the majority of cases, the assigned grid reference relates to the building of the matched address closest to the postcode mean. The grid references provided for Northern Ireland postcodes use the Irish National Grid system that covers all of Ireland and is independent of the British National Grid. No grid references are provided for postcodes in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
The Secure Access version includes all files in the Special Licence version (see SN 6931 for full details), plus a file for each wave that contains four variables relating to the National Grid Reference for each household: easting, northing, positional quality indicator (w_osgrdind), and a variable identifying whether it relates to the British or Irish grid system. The Secure Access version also contains a data file with full dates of birth for Understanding Society and BHPS respondents, which includes the day of birth variable, which is only available in this study.

Latest edition information
For the 17th edition (November 2024), Wave 14 data has been added. Other minor changes and corrections have also been made to Waves 1-13. Please refer to the revisions document for full details.m_hhresp and n_hhresp files updated, December 2024In the previous release (17th edition, November 2024), there was an issue with household income estimates in m_hhresp and n_hhresp where a household resides in a new local authority (approx. 300 households in wave 14). The issue has been corrected and imputation models re-estimated and imputed values updated for the full sample. Imputed values will therefore change compared to the versions in the original release. The variables affected are w_ficountax_dv, w_fihhmnnet3_dv, n_fihhmnnet4_dv and n_ctband_dv.
Suitable data analysis software
These data are provided by the depositor in Stata format. Users are strongly advised to analyse them in Stata. Transfer to other formats may result in unforeseen issues. Stata SE or MP software is needed to analyse the larger files, which contain over 2,047 variables.

The survey instrument is constructed with modules. For a fuller listing of modules and questionnaire content see the User Manual or the online documentation system.

The household grid or enumeration grid has a listing of all household members with information about gender, date of birth, marital and employment status, and relationship to the household respondent. The household questionnaire has questions about housing, mortgage or rent payments, material deprivation, and consumer durables and cars.
The individual adult interview is asked of every person in the household aged 16 or over.4f:T48f,Understanding Society (the UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, and the survey research organisations Verian Group (formerly Kantar Public) and NatCen.

The Understanding Society: Calendar Year Dataset, 2022: Special Licence Access, is designed for analysts to conduct cross-sectional analysis for the 2022 calendar year. The Calendar Year datasets combine data collected in a specific year from across multiple waves and these are released as separate calendar year studies, with appropriate analysis weights, starting with the 2020 Calendar Year dataset. Each subsequent year, an additional yearly study is released.
The Calendar Year data is designed to enable timely cross-sectional analysis of individuals and households in a calendar year. Such analysis can however, only involve variables that are collected in every wave (excluding rotating content which is only collected in some of the waves). Due to overlapping fieldwork the data files combine data collected in the three waves that make up a calendar year. Analysis cannot be restricted to data collected in one wave during a calendar year, as this subset will not be representative of the population. Further details and guidance on this study can be found in the document 9334_main_survey_calendar_year_user_guide_2022.
These calendar year datasets should be used for cross-sectional analysis only. For those interested in longitudinal analyses using Understanding Society please access the main survey datasets: End User Licence version or Special Licence version.
Understanding Society: the UK Household Longitudinal Study, started in 2009 with a general population sample (GPS) of UK residents living in private households of around 26,000 households and an ethnic minority boost sample (EMBS) of 4,000 households. All members of these responding households and their descendants became part of the core sample who were eligible to be interviewed every year. Anyone who joined these households after this initial wave, were also interviewed as long as they lived with these core sample members to provide the household context. At each annual interview, some basic demographic information was collected about every household member, information about the household is collected from one household member, all 16+ year old household members are eligible for adult interviews, 10-15 year old household members are eligible for youth interviews, and some information is collected about 0-9 year olds from their parents or guardians. Since 1991 until 2008/9 a similar survey, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), was fielded. The surviving members of this survey sample were incorporated into Understanding Society in 2010. In 2015, an immigrant and ethnic minority boost sample (IEMBS) of around 2,500 households was added. In 2022 a GPS boost sample (GPS2) of around 5,700 households was added. To know more about the sample design, following rules, interview modes, incentives, consent, questionnaire content please see the study overview and user guide.

This dataset contains Acorn geodemographic segmentation codes (category, group and type) for each household in every wave of Understanding Society and harmonised BHPS, together with a household identification number (hidp) allowing it to be linked to the main Understanding Society data files. The dataset is produced by matching the Acorn segmentation against every Understanding Society household at the postcode level. There are two sets of segmentation codes, 2015 and 2023. The 2015 variables are produced against the acorn 2015 variant and the 2023 variables against a newer acorn variant first produced in 2023.
The Acorn segmentation system itself is developed and maintained by CACI Ltd and is designed to identify characteristics of each postcode according to a hierarchical structure of 7 categories, 22 groups and 64 types. For details on the Acorn segmentation structure and how is it is produced please refer to the documentation and the Caci website.

The Understanding Society: Linked Nest Auto-enrolment Pensions Dataset, 2014-2022: Secure Access study contains a file extracted from the National Employment Savings Trust (Nest), a defined contribution workplace pension scheme set up as part of the UK government's workplace pension reforms under the Pensions Act 2008, with the first members being brought into the scheme in October 2012. This file can be linked (within the UK Data Service Secure Lab) to Understanding Society participants using the cross-wave personal identifier (variable pidp). For all individuals with a valid consent to Nest linkage collected in Wave 11 of Understanding Society, and a Nest account, the data file includes information on: participation in, and levels of savings and withdrawals within, the UK's pensions auto-enrolment system; workers' behaviour within the workplace pensions system; labour market dynamics, including earnings patterns broken down into individual employments. See the documentation for further details.This study is designed to be used in conjunction with one of the main Understanding Society studies (SN 6614, SN 6931 or SN 6676) using pidp as the linking variable. Further details can be found on the

Understanding Society series webpage.  Topics covered in the data files include involvement in and interaction with the auto-enrolment system, including: the start and end months of all enrolments into the Nest scheme contributions paid by the individual, the employer and the government (in tax relief)savings balances, withdrawals and other behaviours within the Nest scheme start and end date of any employments with employers using Nest as their auto-enrolment pension schememonthly pensionable earnings received in each of these employments - as normalised from weekly, fortnightly or monthly payroll data received by Nest from the employerSee the documentation for further details.60:T87b,Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study follows the lives of thousands of individuals within households over time.  It is an internationally recognised study and provides vital evidence for scientists and policymakers on the causes and consequences of deep-rooted social problems.

The study commenced in 2009, building on and incorporating the long-running British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). Covering all the regions and nations of the UK, it has an initial sample of 39,802 households at Wave 1. Sample members are followed when they leave a household, and new people join the Study as they become part of existing sample member households.

Understanding Society has a number of unique design features. It covers the whole population, with boost samples to ensure it is representative of immigrant and ethnic minority groups, and its large sample enables sub-population groups to be examined. Researchers can use the household context to explore how lives link, and the relationships between family members. Its annual data collection means that changes in people’s lives are more accurately captured over time.

Information is collected directly from everyone aged over 10 years, with parents providing information on younger children. Understanding Society asks people about things like their home and family, work and school, health and wellbeing, financial situation and their social and political attitudes. The information people share helps us to understand what people think, feel and do. It also helps us see how society is changing over time. The Study covers everyone in a household, from children to adults, so researchers can understand the experiences of the whole family over time. By 2020, nine Waves of Understanding Society data were available, with 27 years of data available for a significant sub-group who were part of BHPS. Information from the Study is used by researchers to investigate how changes in economic, social and health events affect individuals, households and communities. Evidence from the Study is extensively used by government departments, devolved administrations, agencies, charities, and think tanks.61:T44c,Understanding Society (the UK Household Longitudinal Study), which began in 2009, is conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, and the survey research organisations Verian Group (formerly Kantar Public) and NatCen. It builds on and incorporates, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which began in 1991. 
This dataset contains Strategic Health Authorities (SHA) geographic variables for each wave of Understanding Society and harmonised BHPS to date, and a household identification serial number for file matching to the main data. These data have more restrictive access conditions than those available under the standard End User Licence (see 'Access data' tab for more information).
These data are consistent with the ONS Postcode Directory (ONSPD). Please see the Geographical Lookup Tables document for further details.
Latest Edition Information
For the 16th edition (November 2024), Wave 14 data have been added, and the documentation has been updated. In addition, Wave 13 data has been re-deposited with superfluous entries removed.62:T49e,Understanding Society, also known as the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), is a comprehensive longitudinal survey that examines the social and economic circumstances, attitudes, behaviors, and health of individuals living in UK households. Initiated in 2009, the study involves annual data collection from nearly 32,000 households, with interviews conducted with adults and self-completion questionnaires for 10-15 year-olds. The study is designed to track changes over time, with new participants joining as they become part of existing households.

The survey includes a wide range of data, such as social and economic factors, health measurements, and attitudes, making it a valuable resource for academics, policymakers, and various sectors interested in understanding societal changes. A unique feature of the study is its Innovation Panel, which tests new data collection methods and topics.

UKHLS also emphasizes ethnic diversity, incorporating boost samples to ensure representation of the UK's main ethnic groups and adding an immigrant and ethnic boost sample in 2015. The study's findings are crucial for informing policy and research across multiple disciplines.63:T84c,Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) studies 21st century UK life and how it is changing. It captures important information every year about the social and economic circumstances, attitudes, behaviours and health of people living in thousands of UK households.

Information from the longitudinal survey is primarily used by academics, researchers and policy makers in their work, but the findings are of interest to a much wider group of people including those working in the third sector, health practitioners, business, the media and the general public.

Interviews began in 2009 with eligible members of nearly 32,000 selected households invited to take part. Adults are interviewed and 10-15 year-olds fill in a paper self-completion questionnaire. New people join the study as they join the households of existing members, and if members leave their households, all adult members of their new household are interviewed. In 2010-11, some 20,000 participants aged over 16 also received nurse visits and provided a blood sample and some basic physical measurements (height, weight, blood pressure, grip strength). Data collection is annual, but each wave takes place over a two year period, with the second year of one wave overlapping the first year of the subsequent wave (so wave 1 took place between 2009 and 2011, wave 2 between 2010 and 2012, and so forth). 

A further 8,000 households from the British Household Panel Survey (see below) were invited to join at wave 2.

An additional 1,500 UK households are interviewed for the Innovation Panel, a separate annual survey which is used by researchers as a test bed for new ways of collecting data or exploring new topics before they become part of the main survey.

UKHLS also has an ethnicity strand, with boost samples to ensure the study had at least 1,000 adults from the five main ethnicity groups in the UK. There are also extra questions asked each year of particular relevance to ethnic groups. In 2015, a further immigrant and ethnic boost sample was added to the study.

The Study follows the same 40,000 households over time, beginning in 2009 and providing a detailed picture of how people’s lives are changing. One of the many innovative features of Understanding Society is that a great deal of information about neighbourhoods can be used alongside the individual and household-level information collected in the Study, making it a useful study for neighbourhood effects analyses. In a recent paper (Knies, 2017) we explored four Understanding Society data products, based on four different types of rural-urban/neighbourhood classifications, to throw light on how much heterogeneity in neighbourhood contexts is captured in the first waves of Understanding Society, including change in neighbourhood contexts.

6a:T84c,Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) studies 21st century UK life and how it is changing. It captures important information every year about the social and economic circumstances, attitudes, behaviours and health of people living in thousands of UK households.

Information from the longitudinal survey is primarily used by academics, researchers and policy makers in their work, but the findings are of interest to a much wider group of people including those working in the third sector, health practitioners, business, the media and the general public.

Interviews began in 2009 with eligible members of nearly 32,000 selected households invited to take part. Adults are interviewed and 10-15 year-olds fill in a paper self-completion questionnaire. New people join the study as they join the households of existing members, and if members leave their households, all adult members of their new household are interviewed. In 2010-11, some 20,000 participants aged over 16 also received nurse visits and provided a blood sample and some basic physical measurements (height, weight, blood pressure, grip strength). Data collection is annual, but each wave takes place over a two year period, with the second year of one wave overlapping the first year of the subsequent wave (so wave 1 took place between 2009 and 2011, wave 2 between 2010 and 2012, and so forth). 

A further 8,000 households from the British Household Panel Survey (see below) were invited to join at wave 2.

An additional 1,500 UK households are interviewed for the Innovation Panel, a separate annual survey which is used by researchers as a test bed for new ways of collecting data or exploring new topics before they become part of the main survey.

UKHLS also has an ethnicity strand, with boost samples to ensure the study had at least 1,000 adults from the five main ethnicity groups in the UK. There are also extra questions asked each year of particular relevance to ethnic groups. In 2015, a further immigrant and ethnic boost sample was added to the study.

In 2010-11, some 20,000 participants aged over 16 also received nurse visits and provided a blood sample and some basic physical measurements (height, weight, blood pressure, grip strength). Data collection is annual, but each wave takes place over a two year period, with the second year of one wave overlapping the first year of the subsequent wave (so wave 1 took place between 2009 and 2011, wave 2 between 2010 and 2012, and so forth). 

A further 8,000 households from the British Household Panel Survey (see below) were invited to join at wave 2.

An additional 1,500 UK households are interviewed for the Innovation Panel, a separate annual survey which is used by researchers as a test bed for new ways of collecting data or exploring new topics before they become part of the main survey.

UKHLS also has an ethnicity strand, with boost samples to ensure the study had at least 1,000 adults from the five main ethnicity groups in the UK. There are also extra questions asked each year of particular relevance to ethnic groups. In 2015, a further immigrant and ethnic boost sample was added to the study.
