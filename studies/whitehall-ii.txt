These are in addition to the contribution of unhealthy behaviours and traditional risk factors (such as high blood pressure).\nBy combining over 30 years of data on social inequalities and chronic disease with new clinical measures of cognitive function, mental disorders and physical functioning, the Whitehall II study has become a world-class, interdisciplinary study of ageing, allowing research on multi-morbidity, functional decline, frailty, disability, and dementia.\n\nStudy website: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/whitehallII","image":"https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/img/studies/Whitehall.png","publisher":{"name":"Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London","url":"$undefined","logo":"$undefined"},"funders":[{"name":"MRC BHF NIA ESRC EU_flag ERC\nNational Heart, Lung & Blood Institute","url":"$undefined","logo":"$undefined"}],"geographicCoverage":"GB","temporalCoverage":"$undefined","ageCoverage":"$undefined","studyDesign":[],"resourceType":"study","topics":["Cognitive decline","Reproductive health","Social care -
