Development Study (WCHADS) was established in 2007 to explore the early social, emotional, and biological factors contributing to childhood conduct problems and emotional issues. The study aims to identify different pathways leading to antisocial outcomes, which could inform tailored treatment approaches. The cohort was drawn from first-time mothers receiving antenatal care at the Wirral University Teaching Hospital, with recruitment occurring between February 2007 and October 2008. The study initially enrolled 1286 mothers and 1014 partners, with a final sample of 1233 mothers who had live, singleton births without major congenital abnormalities. A focused subsample of 316 mothers was selected for intensive study based on experiences of partner psychological abuse during pregnancy. The study employs a range of experimental, observational, and biological measurements to achieve its objectives."},"isLoadingEnhancedData":true,"originalSearchResult":{"dataset_schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Dataset","name":"Wirral Child Health and Development Study","description":"$16","url":["https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.wchads/1503038e-c369-4912-a198-85e504c332e7","https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=WCHADS","https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/institute-of-life-and-human-sciences/schools-and-departments/department-of-psychological-sciences/research/first-steps/about/"],"keywords":["Reproductive health","Biomarkers","Education","Cognitive measures","Neighbourhood","Housing","Victimisation and life events","Sleep problems","Parenting and family","Loneliness and social isolation","Work and employment","Digital technology and social media","Covid-19 data collection","Socioeconomic status and deprivation","Language and literacy"],"identifier":["https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291714001342"],"variableMeasured":[{"name":"ph01mx_amom_15_01a_fitting_in","description":"What do you imagine your baby will be like at first?","options":["TAKING OVER EVERYTHING YOU DO","-","FITTING EASILY INTO YOUR LIFE"]},{"name":"ph01mx_amom_15_01b_stranger","description":"What do you imagine your baby will be like at first?","options":["SOMEONE THAT YOU KNOW ALREADY","-","A STRANGER AT FIRST"]},{"name":"ph01mx_amom_15_01d_able_to_tell","description":"What do you imagine your baby will be like at first?","options":["UNABLE TO TELL YOU APART FROM OTHER PEOPLE EARLY ON","-","ABLE TO TELL WHO YOU ARE FROM EARLY ON"]},{"name":"ph01mx_amom_15_01e_communicate","description":"What do you imagine your baby will be like at first?","options":["BORN NEEDING HELP TO LEARN HOW TO COMMUNICATE","BORN BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU","-"]},{"name":"ph01mx_amom_15_01f_what_is_best","description":"What do you imagine your baby will be like at first?","options":["-","BORN KNOWING WHAT IS BEST FOR HIM/HER","AS THE MOTHER YOU KNOW WHAT IS BEST"]},{"name":"ph01mx_amom_15_02a_early_demand","description":"How do you intend to feed your baby?.......

Wirral Child Health and Development Study (WCHADS) was established in 2007 to explore the early social, emotional, and biological factors contributing to childhood conduct problems and emotional

The cohort was drawn from first-time mothers receiving antenatal care at the Wirral University Teaching Hospital, with recruitment occurring between February 2007 and October 2008. The study initially enrolled 1286 mothers and 1014 partners, with a final sample of 1233 mothers who had live, singleton births without major congenital abnormalities. A focused subsample of 316 mothers was selected for intensive study based on experiences of partner psychological abuse during pregnancy.

17:T65d,The Wirral Child Health and Development Study (WCHADS) was established in 2007 to identify early social, emotional and biological risks and processes involved in the development of childhood conduct problems. It was designed to identify pathways to antisocial outcomes that might require differing treatment responses. The study is also ideally designed to identify pathways to childhood emotional problems.
The sample was identified from consecutive first-time mothers who booked for antenatal care at 12 weeks of gestation between 12 February 2007 and 29 October 2008. The booking clinic was administered by the Wirral University Teaching Hospital, which was the sole provider of universal prenatal care on the Wirral Peninsula. The study was introduced to the women by clinic midwives who asked for their agreement to be approached by study research midwives when they attended for ultrasound scanning at 20 weeks of gestation.
A total of 1286 mothers and 1014 partners enrolled in the study (68.4% of those approached) and completed interviews and questionnaires at the 20 weeks stage. The final sample comprised 1233 mothers with live, singleton births with no gross congenital abnormalities and who had remained in the study up to the birth of their baby. A stratified subsample of 316 mothers were identified for intensive study based on a measure of partner psychological abuse in pregnancy.

A total of 1286 mothers and 1014 partners enrolled in the study (68.4% of those approached) and completed interviews and questionnaires at the 20 weeks stage. The final sample comprised 1233 mothers with live, singleton births with no gross congenital abnormalities and who had remained in the study up to the birth of their baby. A stratified subsample of 316 mothers were identified for intensive study based on a measure of partner psychological abuse in pregnancy.

19:T65d,The Wirral Child Health and Development Study (WCHADS) was established in 2007 to identify early social, emotional and biological risks and processes involved in the development of childhood conduct problems. It was designed to identify pathways to antisocial outcomes that might require differing treatment responses. The study is also ideally designed to identify pathways to childhood emotional problems.
The sample was identified from consecutive first-time mothers who booked for antenatal care at 12 weeks of gestation between 12 February 2007 and 29 October 2008. The booking clinic was administered by the Wirral University Teaching Hospital, which was the sole provider of universal prenatal care on the Wirral Peninsula. The study was introduced to the women by clinic midwives who asked for their agreement to be approached by study research midwives when they attended for ultrasound scanning at 20 weeks of gestation.
