As the participants transition into adolescence, the study expands its scope to include factors such as social media experiences, friendships, bullying, risky behaviors, and the physical, hormonal, and psychological changes associated with puberty. The aim is to identify different pathways that may require tailored treatment responses and to enhance understanding of the factors influencing child and adolescent mental health. This research is significant as it provides insights into the early predictors of mental health issues and informs interventions to prevent or mitigate these problems.","urls":["https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=study&studyid=WCHADS",""],"resource_type":"study","harmony_id":"mhc/wchads","end_year":null,"genetic_data_collected":false,"dois":["https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291714001342"],"data_access":"Project proposal - see data access guidance <br>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/iphs/researchgroups/firststeps/WCHADS_Data_Access_Policy_v3_2018-10-15_FINAL.pdf\">WCHADS Data Access Policy (pdf)</a><br><br>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population-health/research/groups/first-steps/information-for-researchers/\">liverpool.ac.uk/population-health/research/groups/first-steps/information-for-researchers/</a>","start_year":2007,"uuid":"f32d8aea5f88e60dea9a6b1e4c730fac","number_of_variables":1073},"distance":0,"score":0,"parent":{},"ancestors":[],"variables_which_matched":"$undefined"},"isDrawerView":false,"studyDataComplete":false}]]
